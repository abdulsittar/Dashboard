{"rank_246": {"title": "Vision of the future or criminal eyesore: what should Rio do with its favelas?", "text": "Despite the looming World Cup and Olympics, constitutional reform and powerful drug lords have kept redevelopment of Rio\u2019s squatter settlements at bay \u2013 but the price is poverty and anarchy\n\nThe granite hump of Providencia gazes down like a stern guardian on the old port of Rio de Janeiro. It offers probably the finest viewpoint over any city I know. Rio\u2019s great bay stretches inland to distant mountains. Below lies what was once the world\u2019s third largest port, now mostly silent. Along the coast a parade of beach resorts march to the foot of Sugar Loaf Mountain, with Copacabana and Ipanema hiding beyond. Over them all towers a range of steep rain-forested hills, crowned by the art deco beacon of Christ the Redeemer. The sight is breath-taking.\n\n\n\nI was admiring this view from the top of the hill when I felt a hand tugging at my belt. In this city of muggers, and eager to avoid a scene, I moved quickly along the handrail, only to be alarmed when the hand came and resumed its grasp. I then noticed it belonged to a blind boy with severe disabilities. I had been blocking his only route home. It was a wretched scene amid that firmament of wonder.\n\nIn most cities, Providencia would be a Montmartre or Nob Hill, a luxury retreat above the city smoke. Yet it is Rio\u2019s oldest favela, settled in 1897 by a group of returning war veterans. Its cheap houses remain to this day, mostly unserviced and stinking of sewage, inaccessible except by precipitous steps.\n\nAt the last count there were roughly 600 such \u201cinformal\u201d communities, accommodating a quarter of the city\u2019s 6 million inhabitants. Over the past half century Rio\u2019s centre of gravity has, as with many cities, drifted west from its original home. It now sprawls for over 20 miles of beaches and promontories, dramatically interspersed with mountains. Clinging to their slopes are squatter settlements, often lying immediately adjacent to rich districts \u201con the asphalt\u201d below.\n\nAll developing cities \u2013 and most developed ones \u2013 have their slums. But Rio\u2019s are remarkable in their ubiquity and in their survival in the same locations. While those on the flat can be reached by road, most are stacked on hillsides, hard to reach on wheels, flooded in storms and lacking sewerage and other public services. Until recently the favelas \u2013 named after scrub plants that once occupied them \u2013 were no-go areas for the police or government officials, and remained in thrall to feuding drugs gangs. They testify to the futility of criminalising the supply of what is a standard consumer product. The favelas are Blade Runner meets Italian hill town.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Violent protests broke out in a favela near Copacabana this month after a resident was killed in clashes with the army. Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty\n\nWith the World Cup and Olympics looming, these places are testing Brazil\u2019s civic conscience. Most cities would by now have contrived to clear such settlements, rehousing their inhabitants with varying degrees of compulsion elsewhere. The process can be seen from Mexico City to Lagos, from Johannesburg to Bangalore, or in London or Paris a century ago. Older areas are gentrified and this in turn draws tax revenue, private investment and political clout to deliver new urban infrastructure. Even in Rio this is happening to such historic central areas as Lapa and Santa Teresa, where old streets are starting to draw restaurants, shops and entertainment back to depressed quarters.\n\n\n\nIn Rio\u2019s favelas, however, any such process has largely stalled. Their control by the drug lords kept all forms of government, including redevelopment, at bay, often at the point of a gun. A 1988 constitutional reform gave residents a degree of security of tenure, usually after five years of occupation, and title deeds are now reckoned to cover between a third and two-thirds of favela residents. Compulsory eviction supposedly requires local consultation and the availability of alternative housing near at hand.\n\nSuch security has not been totally effective, though. The Popular Committee for the World Cup and the Olympics, which has been behind recent protests against the football tournament, claims no fewer than 170,000 people are being removed from their homes for the games. But activists have held out against the sort of mass clearance experienced by British cities in the 1960s and 1970s and by Beijing before its Olympics. Rio has failed to remove the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo favela, which still stands defiantly by the fence of the new Olympic park.\n\nFor followers of post-modernism\u2019s \u201cnew urbanism\u201d, Rio is an exciting, infuriating place. As an urban form the favela is inherently robust, green and \u201csustainable\u201d. It can offer high-density, low-cost living on locations penetrating the city centre and within reasonable reach of work. Its residents rely on walking and two-wheeled vehicles \u2013 taxis are ferocious motorbikes \u2013 creating close-knit, self-reliant communities in which ties of family and neighbour are strong. They delineate their own boundaries of loyalty and defensible space.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The \u2018pacified\u2019 favela of Cantagalo. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nAs a result the world flocks to study them. They have become intellectual works-in-progress to universities such as Pennsylvania, Columbia and the LSE. Pennsylvania even built its own campus \u201cpop-up favela\u201d for study purposes. A leading NGO champion, Theresa Williamson of Catalytic Communities, sees the favelas as the \u201cideal affordable housing stock\u201d. Their buildings are mostly brick-built and sound, maximising every inch of space and fashioned to occupants\u2019 needs. They are low-energy to a fault.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is somehow to upgrade them to meet even the minimal standards expected for modern urban living, without lurching into old-fashioned, state-sponsored clearance and renewal. It is the challenge of the \u201csmart cities\u201d movement. Rio\u2019s authorities have long acknowledged the policy: Favela Bairro in the 1990s saw them as \u201ccivic assets\u201d rather than \u201caberrations\u201d. At its most basic, it secured the widespread concreting of alleys and stairways and introduced some sewerage. The theft of electricity was tolerated, through illicit wires that form a lethal canopy over back lanes.\n\n\n\nFavela Bairro was assessed by the RioOnWatch website as having upgraded 168, or roughly a quarter, of the larger favelas by 2010. That year it was superseded by the Olympic \u201clegacy\u201d programme of Morar Carioca. Launched by the flamboyant mayor, Eduardo Paes, this allotted $4.5bn (\u00a32.7bn) to achieve the complete \u201curbanisation\u201d of the favelas by 2020. The city would be improved from the ground up and through \u201cthe participation of organised society \u2026 through assemblies and meetings in the communities\u201d. In future, the favela would be seen not as Rio\u2019s problem but \u201cthe solution \u2026 the visionary answer to how the world is going to deal with the third of humanity who will live in informal settlements by 2050\u201d.\n\nMorar Carioca was undeniably an imaginative exercise in sensitive urban renewal. Prepared with the Institute of Brazilian Architects , it would retrofit the city\u2019s entire stock of low-cost housing, and do so free of the cost, misery and social disruption of traditional urban renewal. Houses would be left to their owners. The state would renew the public space round them.\n\nThe spirit of Morar Carioca lives, but those involved in it have been disappointed. A visit to the architects\u2019 institute is a gloomy experience, as its president, Sergio Magalhaes, shuffles maps and plans from which one project after another has been removed. What had been \u201ca special moment in mobilising the efforts, hopes and expectations of the people\u201d, he says, had become merely an exercise in using the Olympics to direct investment to rich and expanding areas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Telef\u00e9rico cable car system soars over the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o favela in the north of the city. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nThe promised investment has not been forthcoming, while government effort has been directed at favela \u201cpacification\u201d. Initiated in 2008, this rightly acknowledged that lasting improvement of favela living conditions required government control of law and order. Otherwise nothing would happen. This took the form of mass police incursions into one favela after another, driving the gang leaders out \u2013 even if they merely moved to others. The police then remained as a permanent presence. Favela police commanders would become, in effect, local mayors.\n\n\n\nThe programme has had its failures. Last week a police killing in the Pav\u00e3o-Pav\u00e3ozhino favela near Copacabana showed how easily the police can revert to old and brutal habits. The new police station in Alem\u00e3o is reminiscent of Ulster\u2019s fortified citadels during the troubles. They are hardly a sign of hearts and minds being won and have led the geographer and local blogger, Chris Gaffney, to describe it as having merely \u201creplaced one arbitrary and militarised system of justice with another\u201d. But killings in pacified favelas, by both police and gangs, have halved over the past five years. If pacification is not an end in itself it is the essential beginning of a process, the rule of some sort of law on which regeneration can proceed.\n\nThe trouble, as always, is the lack of resources for that regeneration. Brazil, like most modern political economies, is in thrall to mega-events. Glory lies in the grand gesture, the big scheme, the glamour project. Rio\u2019s current pride and joy is the redevelopment of its disused port area, the Porto Maravilha project. An overhead motorway is being buried underground and a promenade laid out between the downtown and the water. Trump towers and a luxury hotel are to rise beside it. Historic 19th-century streets are being restored and an old slave dock uncovered. A curiously titled \u201cmuseum of the future\u201d designed by Santiago Calatrava is emerging on an old quay.\n\nThis is easy renewal, of a virtually empty zone of the old city. Nor has there been much attempt to repopulate it with socially mixed housing. An effort to clear a third of the adjacent favela of Providencia was balked by furious protests. A local hero, the artist Maur\u00edcio Hora, campaigned against eviction by photographing threatened residents and projecting their faces on to their outside walls.\n\nProvidencia was eventually awarded not improved utilities but one of the more bizarre gestures of urban renewal I have seen. A heavily over-engineered $35m cable car runs just half way up its slope and then appears to have been abandoned. A similar contraption in London\u2019s Docklands runs at barely 10% of capacity. Such investments are beloved of mayors, sponsors and contractors, but seldom of residents.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brazilian artist Maur\u00edcio Hora has documented daily life in the Providencia favela. Photograph: Antonio Scorza/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA longer cable car, meanwhile, carries a trickle of passengers over the roofs of the sprawling favela of Complexo do Alem\u00e3o in north Rio. Its otherworldly structure, constantly moving cars and white-gloved attendants would seem more appropriate to a ski-lift in Gstaadt. It stops near few houses and is unavailable for heavy goods. A ground-level funicular would have made more sense.\n\n\n\nAttempts to upgrade low-lying favelas are eerily reminiscent of similar British projects of the 1960s and 70s. I walked through what is left of Manguinhos with Leona Deckelbaum, a local housing official turned activist. It was old-fashioned federal slum redevelopment: regimented tenements gave on to desolate open spaces, with allotments and kiosks in which local people were expected to find work. While a library has been opened, most of the area was smashed and deserted, the kiosks unused.\n\nNext door, across a no man\u2019s land of rubble, lay the remains of the surviving favela: a warren of lanes, alleys, workshops, bars, undrained and filthy. The place was regularly flooded by a polluted canal, but it was also a live community. \u201cIf only the money would have been spent just fitting drains and sewerage into the old favela,\u201d Deckelbaum said. \u201cBut then, sewers do not look good at world urbanisation conferences \u2013 not like cable cars.\u201d\n\nThe same lesson is evident on the outskirts of the city at Cidade de Deus. This was a state resettlement estate laid out in the 1960s and notorious as setting for the movie, City of God. It was built with only the most rudimentary infrastructure and left to run itself, which soon brought it under the aegis of drug gangs. With no government or planning and few public services, the area\u2019s population grew to 70,000. Floors were added, yards were filled in, lanes disappeared. The original layout was swiftly obliterated. Cidade de Deus has recently been \u201cpacified\u201d. It yet could offer a better template of self-improved housing than a cluster of frigid municipal towers.\n\nYet that prospect for Rio has its own bugbears. After pacification, favelas adjacent to the coast such as Vidigal and Rocinha have seen rents and house prices surge, inviting complaints of gentrification. \u201cFavela chic\u201d has entered the language. TripAdvisor exults over \u201cauthentic eco-friendly favela\u201d tours. Rocinha has coffee and sushi bars. A guest-house hotel on the summit of Vidigal has a view to rival any on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, even if it is desperate to reach. Hip restaurants and alternative bed-and-breakfasts are appearing on the back of discreet coach tours.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A boy rides a bike with no tires in the Complexo da Mare favela, which is being occupied by federal troops ahead of the World Cup. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty\n\nThis presents Rio with the classic urban paradox. The superb location of many favelas gives them immense imputed value from gentrification and tourism, value that in most cities would have long drawn to them new residents, employers and investors. They in turn would have generated resources for better services.\n\n\n\nYet favelas are proud places whose residents enjoy a measure of security of tenure and a growing civic confidence. \u201cWe want to be happy and walk freely in the favela where we were born,\u201d states a protest banner in Manguinhos. Another at Vila Aut\u00f3dromo boasts \u201ca peaceful and orderly neighbourhood since 1967\u201d. As these places are upgraded and made secure, there is an inevitable impact on their desirability and price \u2013 and on the desire of some residents to realise such assets as they have and move elsewhere.\n\n\n\nAll forms of social housing sooner or later must grapple with rights of property transfer. A federal proposal to build 2,200 social housing units in the new Porto Maravilha was challenged by Rio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, on the grounds that their residents would just sell them. \u201cDon\u2019t come to me with laws telling them they cannot sell,\u201d he told a recent conference, \u201cbecause they do it \u2026 everybody sells their house.\u201d While state-run estates, condominiums and co-operatives can impede this, the implied legal control is a far cry from a Rio favela. Besides, the essence of the favela sovereignty is local ownership.\n\nAny visitor to Rio\u2019s poorer districts sees a glaring conflict between the chronic need for investment and the frozen value of the land. People want services \u201cfrom the ground up\u201d, yet are sceptical of the necessary resources being generated by their own rents and taxes \u2013 even if it were to mean new residents, investment in infrastructure, jobs and civic clout. They see gentrification leading to evictions, even where the residents themselves would benefit from property sales. Their default is to see the state as responsible for retrofitting their communities.\n\nAll urban renewal is a conflict between social geography and the market for land. Since the 1980s, Rio\u2019s favelas have \u201ctraded\u201d a degree of security of low-cost tenure for dreadful living conditions and crime-ridden governance. The constitutional \u201cright to occupy\u201d a particular plot of land has been at the price of zero investment, poverty and anarchy. The freedom to stay put implies bondage, if it means being unable to up sticks and move, taking the value of one\u2019s home with one. Paes himself recognises this, and is reluctant to control the housing market and become \u201cthe Fidel Castro of the favelas\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Life in the Cantagalo favela. Photograph: Tasso Marcelo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe favelas are thus a test bed of every tenet of modern urban renewal. They are defended by new urbanists as the social housing stock of the future. But if they remain static communities, they will never see the investment they sorely need. Their aspiring and enterprising young will leave in search of more salubrious living quarters, while their parents stay, as in urban ghettos the world over, prisoners of an archaic poverty.\n\n\n\nRio\u2019s favelas may entrance academics as sustainable informal housing, but academic fashion builds no drains, pipes, schools or clinics. Letting the property market rip is clearly not acceptable, and can be as traumatic to a community as were the mass slum clearances of the 20th century. But there has to be a compromise between gentrification and stasis. Somewhere in a freer residential property market lie the resources to update these places.\n\nFavelas are exciting as a remarkable surviving pattern of urban living. A vision, sensitive and workable, is in place for their renewal. But Rio is still searching for a way to implement it.\n\n\u2022 Simon Jenkins: the World Cup and Olympics threaten to overwhelm Rio \u2013 yet there is time to create a sensation out of disaster\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2014.

We have to follow the best expert advice.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) became the first to break with the IOC\u2019s insistence on bacteria-only testing, saying it would do its own independent tests for viruses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to find someone who can do the testing for us that can safely cover what we need to know from a virus perspective as well as the bacteria perspective,\u201d said Peter Sowrey, chief executive of the ISAF. \u201cThat\u2019s my plan.\u201d\n\nThat came after the WHO said on Saturday that it had advised the IOC to test for viruses.\n\nA five-month Associated Press analysis of water at each of the venues where about 1,400 Olympic athletes will have contact with water showed dangerously high levels of viruses from sewage.\n\nThe Associated Press commissioned four rounds of testing in each of those three Olympic water venues, and also in the surf off Ipanema beach, which is popular with tourists but where no events will be held. Thirty-seven samples were checked for three types of human adenovirus, as well as rotavirus, enterovirus and faecal coliforms.\n\nThe Associated Press viral testing, which will continue in the coming year, found not one water venue safe for swimming or boating, according to global water experts who analysed the data. A risk assessment done based on the Associated Press\u2019s study found that athletes who ingest just three teaspoons of water have a 99% chance of being infected by a virus \u2013 though that does not automatically mean they would fall ill. That depends upon a person\u2019s immune system and a number of other factors.\n\nThe concentrations of the viruses in all samples were roughly equivalent to that seen in raw sewage \u2013 even at one of the least-polluted areas tested, Copacabana beach, where marathon and triathlon swimming will take place and where many of the expected 350,000 foreign tourists may take a dip.\n\nIn Rio, much of sewage goes untreated and runs down hillside ditches and streams into Olympic water venues that are littered with floating rubbish, household waste and even dead animals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A doll\u2019s head floats in the polluted waters of a canal at the Mare slum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photograph: Leo Correa/AP\n\nThe pollution problem has been around for decades, and has sparked what top medical experts in Rio call an endemic public health crisis because of the dirty water in the otherwise stunning city circled by Atlantic rainforest and golden sand beaches.\n\nOn Sunday, athletes competed under a blazing Rio sun in an Olympic test event in the triathlon.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting learning experience over the last few days. I think some athletes went back to biology 101 to learn the difference between bacteria and viruses,\u201d said American triathlete Sarah True, who has qualified for next year\u2019s Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of eye-opening for me that people didn\u2019t differentiate the two.\u201d\n\nShe said that for the athletes, \u201cobviously it\u2019s a concern \u2013 it\u2019s a risk\u201d but that \u201cultimately the Olympic dream is so strong that sometimes we put the pursuit of excellence above our health\u201d.\n\nTrue said she didn\u2019t think the Olympic venue could be moved from Copacabana even if the IOC\u2019s tests also find high viral counts.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t move,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately too much money has been invested.\u201d\n\nSo far, neither the IOC nor the sailing federation has said who would do their testing. Virology experts in Brazil say there are only three or four labs with the molecular biology equipment and trained scientists who can carry out the testing for viruses in water.\n\nThe Associated Press\u2019s tests are being conducted by Fernando Spilki, a respected virologist who is a board member of the Brazilian Society for Virology and editor of its scientific journal. He is not being paid by the Associated Press to conduct the testing, though the Associated Press is purchasing the lab materials required to carry out the research.\n\nWhen Rio was awarded the games in 2009, it promised cleaning its waters would be an Olympic legacy.

In fact, few have heard his name even in his home country, but this sprightly 91-year-old businessman is on course to profit from the mega-event like no other individual in the history of the Games.\n\nWith land holdings of at least 6m square metres \u2013 equivalent to about 8,000 football pitches \u2013 in and around the main Olympic site at Barra da Tijuca, Carvalho has seen his wealth surge since Rio was chosen as the host city in 2009, thanks to what he describes as the \u201cbillion-dollar jump\u201d of Games-related, publicly funded development.\n\nThis has already propelled him into the higher echelons of the global rich, but he has still more at stake with a near-$1bn (\u00a3640m) investment in the athletes\u2019 village and the Olympic Park, parts of which will be sold off after the Games as luxury housing. He also recently built a 3,000-room, five-star hotel on a nearby plot of his land, which is slated for theatres, universities and 100-metre wide boulevards that, he says, \u201cwill be the envy of New York\u201d.\n\nWith the Brazilian economy now facing its sharpest decline in more than 20 years, continued profits are by no means guaranteed. But Carvalho says that in the long term, he expects his investment not just to pay off lucratively, but to reshape the city.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carlos Carvalho with a map of the area around the Olympic Park in Rio. Photograph: Jonathan Watts/The Guardian\n\nWhat the Olympics means for the people of Rio Read more\n\nHis vision \u2013 sketched out in an interview with the Guardian \u2013 is for Barra (this is the place name in all International Olympic Committee documents, though the location is actually in the neighbouring district of Jacarepagu\u00e1) to become home to a \u201cnoble\u201d elite, cleared of poor communities, and ultimately destined as the centre of a \u201cbeautiful new Rio de Janeiro\u201d.\n\nThis is likely to stir up a heated debate. Brazil is one of the world\u2019s most unequal nations. Poverty and homelessness are serious problems. The use of the Games to create a new home for the privileged is not what the IOC is supposed to be referring to when it talks about a legacy. Questions are already being asked about whether the huge government infrastructure spending for the event is disproportionately benefiting a handful of already very rich landowners and developers such as Carvalho.\n\nSpeaking at the headquarters of his company Carvalho Hosken, he said he is prepared for a backlash once the public and the IOC realises just how upscale the Ilha Pura athletes\u2019 village will be compared with previous Games.\n\nCarvalho said: \u201cI have the impression this will be controversial. Since the work isn\u2019t finished, they have the idea that everything is fine just because the buildings are ready. But they haven\u2019t been able to see what will happen from now until the end. The gardens that are planned for the inside will be at a level that only kings have previously had.\u201d\n\nThe site is now 70% complete, but glossy brochures and a promotional video show how it will look next year with stunning coastal vistas, swimming pools, an artificial lake and 70,000 square metres of tropical gardens and parks beside the Jacarepagu\u00e1 lagoon.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Construction of Olympic venues in Barra. Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\n\nRio Olympics: public scepticism persists as preparations approach final lap Read more\n\nThe contrast with the London Olympics is stark. While the 2012 hosts used the Games to rejuvenate the run-down East End and build comparatively modest housing, Rio is taking a brownfield site and developing it for a high-end market.\n\nThis is not the entire story. Other Olympic venues are being built or refurbished in the less affluent districts around Deodoro, the Sambadrome and the Maracan\u00e3, but the bulk of the new construction is in Barra on land owned or developed by Carvalho Hosken and its partners.\n\nCarvalho insists the quality of the accommodation must match the tone of a valuable, privileged area.\n\nSitting across from a bust of Napoleon and next to a wall-sized map of Barra, he said: \u201cWe think that if the standards were lowered, we would be taking away from what the city \u2013 the new city \u2013 could represent on the global scene as a city of the elite, of good taste. Ilha Pura could not scratch this destiny that has been given to the region. For this reason, it needed to be noble housing, not housing for the poor.\u201d\n\nTransforming Barra into the centre of a modern, new Rio is at the heart of Carvalho\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luxury flats overlooking the Rio Olympic Arena. Photograph: Sowersby/REX Shutterstock\n\nWith an impressive display of foresight, he bought a 10m square metre tract of land in 1973 on the western edge of Barra overlapping Jacarepagu\u00e1, which was then a sparsely populated swamp, forest and abandoned coffee plantation. He was inspired by the urban planner L\u00facio Costa, who drew up a masterplan for Rio that correctly envisaged the city spreading west along the coast and predicted that Barra would one day be its hub.\n\nIn the 42 years that followed, the growth of Barra has been spectacularly profitable. Carvalho said: \u201cIt has been exponential. Like owning an oil well right on the surface.\u201d\n\nHe was one of three major landholders to benefit, alongside Tjong Hiong Oei, a Singaporean (now deceased) who built the shopping malls and tower blocks along the district\u2019s central thoroughfare \u2013 the Avenida das Americas \u2013 and Pasquale Mauro, an 88-year-old Italian.\n\nThe development of the western zone is far from universally popular. Traditionalists view Barra as a tacky eyesore. While most of the tourist images of Rio de Janeiro focus on the beauty of the natural landscape, antique mosaic pavements, teeming favelas and European colonial architecture, Barra has wide straight roads, giant shopping malls and gated condominium blocks that echo Miami or Los Angeles rather than Lisbon or Porto.\n\nBut supporters say this is the future; that Rio needs to attract more wealth in order to generate more jobs. The Olympics has helped them. The IOC initially rejected Rio\u2019s bid for the 2012 Games, that would have been held in the more run-down areas of the Ilha do Governador. However, in 2009 it approved a revised bid for 2016 with Barra at its heart.\n\n\n\nForced evictions in Rio favela for 2016 Olympics trigger violent clashes Read more\n\nThat allowed the mayor, Eduardo Paes, who cut his political teeth in Barra, to direct tens of billions of reais in public funds for infrastructure investment to the western zone. Barra has since benefited from the extension of metro line four, upgraded highways and new rapid bus services (the TransOl\u00edmpica, TransOeste and TransCarioca), as well as more power lines, water pipes and sewage treatment facilities.\n\n\n\nCarvalho said this accelerated Barra\u2019s growth by 30 years: \u201cThe most difficult part of the development plan was the service infrastructure and the Olympics has brought that. It\u2019s a billion-dollar jump.\u201d\n\nThat may be a modest estimate. Laudimiro Cavalcanti, the director of the regional council of realtors, said property prices have risen higher in Barra than anywhere else in Brazil in recent years. Before the Olympics were awarded to Rio in 2009, the average value of a square metre of land was 3,000 reais, he said. Today, it is triple that amount, having increased twice as fast as other neighbourhoods in Rio (and about five times faster than London in the same period).\n\n\n\nCarvalho Hosken is now valued at 15bn reais (\u00a32.8bn), according to an article on the company\u2019s website. This makes its founder one of the wealthiest men in the world. \u201cThere\u2019s one stockholder and that\u2019s me. To do something crazy, you have to do it alone,\u201d he said. His children, who have a minority share, have also benefited.\n\n\n\nBoth Carvalho and Mauro are involved in Olympic projects. Carvalho Hosken is a 50-50 partner with Odebrecht in the billion reais Ilha Pura development. They plan to profit through the sale of the 3,604 apartments for up to 1.5m reais each.\n\nThe company has also invested about 330m reais in the private-public partnership at the Olympic Park, which it hopes to recoup later by building more luxury condominiums on the site, a former racetrack.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Residents of Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, a favela next to the Olympic Park, hang banners in protest at the demolition of homes. Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPart of this area is occupied by the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo community, a shanty town of fishermen and construction workers. Although the poor residents have legal ownership of their land, they are being pushed aside in the name of the Olympics.\n\nCarvalho said: \u201cThey are going to housing at their standard. They have to go.\u201d He argues that the lower social classes already have space to live on the periphery of the city, while the elite belong in the centre.\n\n\n\nThe process of relocation is being carried out by the municipal and state government authorities. The majority of residents have accepted compensation or been moved to alternative housing about 1km away. Those who tried to stay have fared less well. At least six Vila Aut\u00f3dromo residents have been wounded in demolition operations backed by police using batons, teargas and rubber bullets.\n\n\n\nThe order to drive them from their homes was issued earlier this year by the mayor. Carvalho said Paes has helped him. The support has been reciprocated.\n\n\n\nDuring his re-election campaign in 2012, Paes and his party \u2013 the Brazilian Democratic Movement (PMDB) \u2013 declared at least 1.14m reais in campaign donations from Carvalho and Cyrela, another Barra developer that is linked to Mauro and has luxury apartments on the perimeter of the Olympic golf course.\n\nWithin three months of winning a second term, the mayor changed building codes in the Olympic Park area, raising the maximum height of tower blocks from 12 to 18 floors. In return, Carvalho Hosken agreed to donate some of its land and to shoulder the cost with its partners of the $480m Games media and broadcasting centres.\n\nBrazil elite profit from $3bn Petrobras scandal as laid-off workers pay the price Read more\n\nIn one sense this was ingenious deal-making. By attracting private investment, the city is getting an Olympic Games at less than half price. In contrast to the billions of government funds squandered on World Cup facilities, only 43% of the 38bn reais cost of the Olympics is being paid for with taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nBut critics say the ties between politicians and businessmen are too cosy and the benefits excessive. Paulo Ramos, a member of the opposition Socialism and Liberty party (PSOL), has no doubt who will profit most from the Olympics: \u201cThe contractors \u2013 Carvalho Hosken and Odebrecht. He said he believed \u201cBarra is a scandal.\u201d\n\nThe wider context \u2013 involving matters unrelated to the Olympic park development \u2013 helps explain why some are suspicious. In the past year, there has been a tsunami of revelations of alleged widespread and illegal collusion between politicians and businessmen, casting a shadow on all major projects. Carvalho Hosken has not been implicated, but its two partners in the Olympic Park developments \u2013 the construction firms Odebrecht and Andrade Gutierrez \u2013 are separately under investigation in the biggest bribery and kickback scandal in Brazil\u2019s history, operation Lava Jato, which is looking into accusations of wrongdoing at the oil company Petrobras.\n\nFollowing complaints by environmental campaigners, the Rio public prosecutor\u2019s office has launched an investigation into possible excessive profits from the Olympic golf course, in which Mauro is a major investor.\n\nIn a document outlining the investigation, the prosecutor\u2019s office said that it was looking into claims that \u201cthere is a glaring disproportion between the earnings of the owner and the amount the municipal government is losing or failing to earn.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest High-rise buildings in the Marapendi area of Rio, which will be home to a golf area for the Games. Photograph: Carlos Cazalis/Corbis\n\nAfter winning re-election, Paes allowed the golf course to encroach upon a 58,500 square metre area of the Marapendi municipal natural park. The city said it would offset the lost parkland by creating an even bigger natural area nearby.\n\nConservationists claim this is an environmental crime and that the developers will benefit excessively because the course will only cost 60m reais, but the potential profit from the change in building height limits in that area could be as much as 1bn reais.\n\n\n\nThe developers and the Rio city government argue that they are working to put in place the infrastructure required for the Olympics at the most cost-effective way for taxpayers.\n\nPaes told the Guardian: \u201cBy Brazilian law, it is legal for a candidate and political party to receive donations from private corporations. This fact has nothing to do with the work of the developers at the Olympic Park. Rio created public-private partnerships to run many Olympic projects, with the purpose of saving public resources. These kind of actions allow Rio to have an Olympic Games with more than half the projects funded by private money. This way, public money can be strongly invested in local projects, such as schools and clinics.\u201d\n\nHe has also issued a 330-page rebuttal to criticism of the golf course expansion, saying it was the best option once the IOC decided that the sport should be reintroduced to the Games.\n\nRio 2016: Occupy takes swing at Olympic golf course Read more\n\nCarvalho \u2013 who is not involved in the golf course \u2013 sees his activities in a noble light: contributing to the Olympics, helping the city modernise and realising an old dream to make Barra the heart of Rio. Although he has profited enormously so far, he also bears considerable risk. For the first time in seven years, Rio\u2019s property prices fell in June.\n\nSo far, less than 10% of the Ilha Pura units have found buyers. Most of the rest have been taken off the market until demand recovers.\n\n\n\nThe developer says that, financially, he can afford to wait: \u201cThe biggest advantage I have is the certainty that it\u2019ll be lucrative. The biggest challenge is getting the tone right.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to fully realising his grander ambitions, Carvalho is realistic: \u201cI won\u2019t see the climax, but I\u2019m very happy that I am already seeing a great city within Barra da Tijuca.\u201d\n\nLike the IOC, he is clearly already thinking of his legacy. The next year or so will determine whether he is primarily remembered as the bold pioneer of a modern new Rio, the victim of a Brazilian economic meltdown, or the biggest beneficiary in history of an Olympic bonanza.\n\nAdditional research by Shanna Hanbury", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d92d5e240a7cb52d3355e2805ca92c54dcca8c/0_259_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8f26d496f011c4b12b4575425c9044b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e355469e468642e28a10e867b66fae408dc0fd1/0_0_4900_2941/master/4900.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e9c45299bac43252a03bcf19ff10edf", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+2016%2CBrazil%2CAmericas%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CWorld+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f9fbf96517b8c2bd8de241212bee9e44b2b580f/0_57_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e603914b3e6276c97ead19af6608ec2f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e95c9300ccea479f0a70bdaac772abda45e562d/0_259_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=236a107c97058fb7113d0b36c412ec65", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d92d5e240a7cb52d3355e2805ca92c54dcca8c/0_228_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9e80b82f5da444900eccd581e68a499", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eca55171ec7ff81bbf651a6758820c8ac064d91/0_42_5935_3562/master/5935.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e77a143f12224437562c83068b12478", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/479cc80772163bbc05ac15cce9e59bc7b2c07264/0_0_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ba0f1bec1c83f0566a0bdf03cfe89d8"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1d92d5e240a7cb52d3355e2805ca92c54dcca8c/0_228_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9e80b82f5da444900eccd581e68a499", "date": "04/08/2015"}, "rank_43": {"title": "Rio Olympics: public scepticism persists as preparations approach final lap", "text": "Progress on venues and infrastructure is evident but the city faces its biggest test of public opinion this week, one year before the Games open\n\nRio de Janeiro is stepping up the pace as it approaches the last lap of its Olympic preparations to ensure there will be no repeat of the last-minute rush seen before last year\u2019s World Cup, but it still has a way to go to prove the 38.2bn reais (\u00a37.9bn) cost is worthwhile.\n\n\n\nWhat the Olympics means for the people of Rio Read more\n\nOn the eve of celebrations to mark Wednesday\u2019s one-year countdown, a handful of facilities are already finished, including the Maracan\u00e3 stadium, which will host the opening ceremony on 5 August. International Olympic Committee officials, who visit this week, will be told that the others should be completed by the end of the year, including the velodrome, hockey grounds and a new Olympic golf course, which has been designed by Gil Hanse, that will host a test tournament from 26-29 November.\n\n\n\nThe aquatic centre, whitewater channels, mountain bike park and Deodoro stadium (which will host the rugby) are due to follow in the first three months of 2016. Cutting it finer are the equestrian arena and shooting range, which are not set for completion until after April, and the athletics stadium, which will stage its main test event \u2013 the Ibero-American championships \u2013 in mid-May. The biggest concern is the tennis centre, which was labelled \u201chigh risk\u201d earlier this month by a municipal auditing court due to budget overruns. Government officials, however, say everything will be delivered on time. IOC inspectors will make their own judgment when they visit the main sites at Barra and Deodoro next week.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aerial view of the construction site of Rio 2016\u2019s golf venue. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nOn a recent tour of the Olympic Park at Barra, journalists saw evident progress. The three Carioca arenas \u2013 which will stage martial arts, fencing, wrestling, basketball and wheelchair rugby \u2013 were almost complete, with smooth flooring, functioning lights and seating in place and wrapped in plastic. The structure of other facilities, including the velodrome and aquatics centre, were also at an advanced stage.\n\nCity officials say they learned from the London Games, particularly with regard to the legacy issue of how facilities would be used after the competition. Showing slides of abandoned venues after the Atlanta, Athens and Beijing Olympics, Pedro Paulo Carvalho, the secretary of coordination, promised that Rio would not have similar white elephants. Officials said the handball arena would be broken up, relocated and reused as schools, part of the aquatic centre would be moved into a central location, the Carioca arenas would become training centres and classrooms, while the Deodoro site was earmarked for leisure, including hiking trails and \u201cplaces to contemplate nature\u201d.\n\nThe public is sceptical, having heard similar pledges ahead of the Pan-American Games and World Cup that were subsequently broken. The Rio Games also appear to have stirred up mixed emotions. Although an Olympic committee survey in December showed 65% of Rio residents were optimistic about the Games, the demand for tickets has so far been modest.\n\nOrganisers expect enthusiasm to pick up once the sport begins \u2013 a claim boosted by the noisy support at last weekend\u2019s test triathlon. That is a just a taste of what will come next year. Over 16 days, a worldwide audience of billions will watch the 300-or-so events, including the return of golf and rugby, Usain Bolt\u2019s bid for a third hat-trick of gold medals, and Neymar\u2019s efforts to put last year\u2019s World Cup miseries behind him and lead Brazil to the only major prize in football that has eluded them.\n\nThe setting should be spectacular, starting with the opening ceremony which will be directed by a team of collaborators including Fernando Meirelles (director of City of God) followed by the first event: beach volleyball at Copacabana. There will also be breathtaking backdrops to the cycling along the coast and through the forested hillsides, and a marathon that starts and finishes in the Sambadrome, passing favelas and iconic sites such as the Lapa arches and Sugarloaf mountain.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The swimming stage of the women\u2019s triathlon Olympic qualifier begins on Copacabana beach Photograph: Sergio Moraes/Reuters\n\nThe city hopes the event will boost development. For every $6 (\u00a33.85) it spends on the Olympics, it says only $1 is on sport and the rest on infrastructure. It also expects the international competition will boost the profile of the Rio.\n\n\n\nOlympic athletes spurn virus exposure warnings in Rio's contaminated waters Read more\n\nBut the spotlight can be harsh. The runup to the one-year countdown has seen Amnesty release a critical report on the lethal violence of police in Rio. The Associated Press published a highly critical investigation of water quality at Olympic and Paralympic venues, which were described as filled with \u201cbasically raw sewage\u201d.\n\n\n\nThis is far from the image that the city hoped to present ahead of the expected arrival next year of about 10,500 Olympians, 4,400 Paralympians and 480,000 tourists.\n\n\n\nBut that won\u2019t be the only challenge to the old stereotype of cariocas living a life of sun, sea, samba and alegria. These are grim times for Brazil. The political and business worlds are in turmoil over the lava jato (carwash) investigation into the country\u2019s worst corruption scandal. The economy is slipping into recession (though the fall of the currency will benefit tourists). Football would usually be a source of national solace, but offers scant consolation due to the Fifa bribery inquiry and painful memories of last year\u2019s 7-1 World Cup humiliation by Germany.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Deodoro sports complex, under construction in Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nElsewhere, Olympic dreams are also undergoing something of a reality check after a month in which Boston \u2013 a city much admired by Rio mayor Eduardo Paes \u2013 decided to abandon its bid for the 2024 Games due to cost concerns, while Tokyo announced that it was scaling back plans for the main 2020 stadium because of the expense. For Rio, however, there is no turning back.\n\n\n\nCarvalho has insisted the cost of mega-events like the Olympics are justified. \u201cIt is valid if the benefits include a transformation of the city. It is not valid if it is just for the sporting event,\u201d he told the Guardian. The municipal government is using the Games to accelerate development of its west zone, by investing heavily in infrastructure, including road, bus and metro links to the Olympic sites.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sugar Loaf mountain provides a backdrop for the men\u2019s triathlon Olympic qualifying in Rio.

International Olympic Committee officials, who visit this week, will be told that the others should be completed by the end of the year, including the velodrome, hockey grounds and a new Olympic golf course, which has been designed by Gil Hanse, that will host a test tournament from 26-29 November.\n\n\n\nThe aquatic centre, whitewater channels, mountain bike park and Deodoro stadium (which will host the rugby) are due to follow in the first three months of 2016. Cutting it finer are the equestrian arena and shooting range, which are not set for completion until after April, and the athletics stadium, which will stage its main test event \u2013 the Ibero-American championships \u2013 in mid-May. The biggest concern is the tennis centre, which was labelled \u201chigh risk\u201d earlier this month by a municipal auditing court due to budget overruns. Government officials, however, say everything will be delivered on time. IOC inspectors will make their own judgment when they visit the main sites at Barra and Deodoro next week.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aerial view of the construction site of Rio 2016\u2019s golf venue. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nOn a recent tour of the Olympic Park at Barra, journalists saw evident progress. The three Carioca arenas \u2013 which will stage martial arts, fencing, wrestling, basketball and wheelchair rugby \u2013 were almost complete, with smooth flooring, functioning lights and seating in place and wrapped in plastic. The structure of other facilities, including the velodrome and aquatics centre, were also at an advanced stage.\n\nCity officials say they learned from the London Games, particularly with regard to the legacy issue of how facilities would be used after the competition. Showing slides of abandoned venues after the Atlanta, Athens and Beijing Olympics, Pedro Paulo Carvalho, the secretary of coordination, promised that Rio would not have similar white elephants. Officials said the handball arena would be broken up, relocated and reused as schools, part of the aquatic centre would be moved into a central location, the Carioca arenas would become training centres and classrooms, while the Deodoro site was earmarked for leisure, including hiking trails and \u201cplaces to contemplate nature\u201d.\n\nThe public is sceptical, having heard similar pledges ahead of the Pan-American Games and World Cup that were subsequently broken. The Rio Games also appear to have stirred up mixed emotions. Although an Olympic committee survey in December showed 65% of Rio residents were optimistic about the Games, the demand for tickets has so far been modest.\n\nOrganisers expect enthusiasm to pick up once the sport begins \u2013 a claim boosted by the noisy support at last weekend\u2019s test triathlon. That is a just a taste of what will come next year. Over 16 days, a worldwide audience of billions will watch the 300-or-so events, including the return of golf and rugby, Usain Bolt\u2019s bid for a third hat-trick of gold medals, and Neymar\u2019s efforts to put last year\u2019s World Cup miseries behind him and lead Brazil to the only major prize in football that has eluded them.\n\nThe setting should be spectacular, starting with the opening ceremony which will be directed by a team of collaborators including Fernando Meirelles (director of City of God) followed by the first event: beach volleyball at Copacabana. There will also be breathtaking backdrops to the cycling along the coast and through the forested hillsides, and a marathon that starts and finishes in the Sambadrome, passing favelas and iconic sites such as the Lapa arches and Sugarloaf mountain.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The swimming stage of the women\u2019s triathlon Olympic qualifier begins on Copacabana beach Photograph: Sergio Moraes/Reuters\n\nThe city hopes the event will boost development. For every $6 (\u00a33.85) it spends on the Olympics, it says only $1 is on sport and the rest on infrastructure. It also expects the international competition will boost the profile of the Rio.\n\n\n\nOlympic athletes spurn virus exposure warnings in Rio's contaminated waters Read more\n\nBut the spotlight can be harsh. The runup to the one-year countdown has seen Amnesty release a critical report on the lethal violence of police in Rio. The Associated Press published a highly critical investigation of water quality at Olympic and Paralympic venues, which were described as filled with \u201cbasically raw sewage\u201d.\n\n\n\nThis is far from the image that the city hoped to present ahead of the expected arrival next year of about 10,500 Olympians, 4,400 Paralympians and 480,000 tourists.\n\n\n\nBut that won\u2019t be the only challenge to the old stereotype of cariocas living a life of sun, sea, samba and alegria. These are grim times for Brazil. The political and business worlds are in turmoil over the lava jato (carwash) investigation into the country\u2019s worst corruption scandal. The economy is slipping into recession (though the fall of the currency will benefit tourists). Football would usually be a source of national solace, but offers scant consolation due to the Fifa bribery inquiry and painful memories of last year\u2019s 7-1 World Cup humiliation by Germany.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Deodoro sports complex, under construction in Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nElsewhere, Olympic dreams are also undergoing something of a reality check after a month in which Boston \u2013 a city much admired by Rio mayor Eduardo Paes \u2013 decided to abandon its bid for the 2024 Games due to cost concerns, while Tokyo announced that it was scaling back plans for the main 2020 stadium because of the expense. For Rio, however, there is no turning back.\n\n\n\nCarvalho has insisted the cost of mega-events like the Olympics are justified. \u201cIt is valid if the benefits include a transformation of the city. It is not valid if it is just for the sporting event,\u201d he told the Guardian. The municipal government is using the Games to accelerate development of its west zone, by investing heavily in infrastructure, including road, bus and metro links to the Olympic sites.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sugar Loaf mountain provides a backdrop for the men\u2019s triathlon Olympic qualifying in Rio.

But the results haven\u2019t lived up to expectations\n\nOne year from today, the city of Rio de Janeiro will kick off the 2016 Olympic Games, bringing tens of thousands of spectators to the city, and billions of dollars into Brazil. Traditionally, in the run-up to every Olympic Games, the host city makes a big show of highlighting the positive impact the Games will have on the city\u2019s infrastructure, services, and economy.\n\nIn some cases, those promises bear fruit: Barcelona is widely recognized as a successful example of leveraging Olympics-sized spending for the greater good. Residents of many other Games host cities, however, have found the experience to be a mixed blessing at best.

As a result, they say, thousands of children have been displaced and left \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 unable to access education, healthcare and other social services.\n\n\n\nThe dossier claims other youths have been the victims of an uptick in police and army violence as a result of a struggling favela pacification program that is part of the city\u2019s efforts to prepare for mega-events. Some have been shot and killed, many wounded and countless others psychologically scarred by gunfights and tension.\n\n\n\nTerre des Hommes, the NGO that contributed the chapter on children, has produced video testimonies from some of those affected, including Naomy, a 12-year-old girl who sees swaths of her community Vila Aut\u00f3dromo demolished to make way for the Olympic Park, and Gabriel, a 13-year-old boy who was hit by a bullet while playing marbles after the army moved in to the Complexo da Mar\u00e9 favela complex ahead of the World Cup.\n\n\n\nThe report cites earlier studies by Brunel University, which found that risks of child exploitation \u2013 particularly with regard to labour and eviction \u2013 increased during previous mega sporting events such as the South Africa World Cup in 2010.\n\n\n\nIt also includes more recent research by Dundee University and the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro into the impact of the World Cup on local children. Among many concerns, it noted the disappearances of several street children who were removed from the streets in \u201csocial cleansing\u201d operations ahead of major events.\n\n\n\nThe Rio city government disputes the allegations. It says that most of the displacements, with the exception of Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, are unrelated to the World Cup and the Olympics.\n\nInstead, it says 72% of relocated families have been moved away from areas prone to floods and landslides, and 9.6% for transportation and other infrastructure projects that benefit the city as a whole. A spokesman said the city\u2019s children are now better off than before thanks to increased spending on healthcare and education.\n\n\n\nThe Rio property developer hoping for a $1bn Olympic legacy of his own Read more\n\nThe Comit\u00e9 Popular \u2013 a group that was active in the mass protests ahead of the World Cup \u2013 counters that the social costs of mega-events outweigh the benefits, which are skewed towards the wealthier parts of the city.\n\nAhead of next year\u2019s Games, the Comit\u00e9 Popular and its partners call on the government to halt evictions, harassment of street vendors, and \u201ccleansing\u201d of homeless children and adolescents. It also urges the IOC to issue a human rights commitment and introduce monitoring systems for all stages of the Games.\n\n\u201cThe IOC should ensure that the 2016 Summer Olympics do not cause or exacerbate human and child rights abuses in Rio. It is time that the IOC lives up to the values declared in the Olympic Charter,\u201d said Ignacio Parker, secretary general of Terre des Hommes.\n\nThe dossier \u2013 the fourth and most comprehensive to date \u2013 was launched as the IOC meets in Lausanne to discuss Agenda 2020, the strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement. The governing body will discuss the fundamental principles of sport at a time when football is mired in a Fifa corruption scandal, athletics is plagued by doping revelations and the Olympics is dogged by claims of human rights violations in host countries.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the IOC on its back foot, perhaps we\u2019re actually witnessing a propitious moment for human rights groups to press for meaningful change,\u201d said Jules Boykoff, a professor of political science at Pacific University.\n\n\u201cThe Olympics have long provided local developers and politicians with an alibi to steamroll already marginalized communities \u2026 The IOC absolutely needs to start taking human rights more seriously.

At Fort Duque de Caxias, close to Copacabana beach, troops pour chlorine into water tanks and clear gutters where larvae might be found. From the 13th, they will join public officials on missions to schools, favelas, condominiums and public spaces.\n\nCity at centre of Brazil's Zika epidemic reeling from disease's insidious effects Read more\n\nWere it not for the rapid spread of the virus, which is thought to have infected 1.5 million Brazilians since it was first found in the country last April, soldiers might have been preparing for the Games, where they will join the police in providing security.\n\n\u201cWe hope that by the time of the Olympics we can revert to our main role of security because the climate should be cooler and the disease risk lower,\u201d said Captain Luiz Eduardo Madureira de Moraes.\n\nThe organisers are also praying that current tsunami of dire news will be a bad memory by the opening ceremony on 5 August. But currently, it seems that nothing can go right.\n\nThe economy \u2013 which was surging ahead of the UK five years ago \u2013 has stuttered, slipped and now fallen into what looks set to be the deepest recession in more than 100 years.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Builders work at the construction site of Barra Olympic Park for the Rio 2016 Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photograph: Xu Zijian/Xinhua Press/Corbis\n\nThe nation\u2019s political class \u2013 once admired for the progressive and popular policies of former Workers party president Lu\u00edz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 is fractured, paralysed and despised. Lula\u2019s successor, Dilma Rousseff, is the most unpopular leader in more than two decades and now faces the prospect of impeachment by congress.\n\n\n\nThe business world is ensnared in the country\u2019s worst ever corruption scandal, involving billions of dollars of kickbacks to politicians from inflated contracts for public works. The head of the country\u2019s biggest construction firm, Odebrecht, is in jail. Former global titans, such as Petrobras and Vale, have seen their market value sink, their credit ratings slashed and their workforces (largely concentrated in Rio) downsized.\n\nAnd now to top it all, the population has been hit by the country\u2019s worst public health crisis in living memory: a Zika epidemic that has been linked to a surge in reported cases of microcephaly in newborns, and is now at the centre of what the World Health Organisation declared this week to be \u201ca global health emergency\u201d.\n\nThe Doctor\u2019s Union of Rio de Janeiro warned last month that the health sector \u2013 which recently suffered budget cuts due to the recession \u2013 is not prepared for the Olympic influx.\n\n\u201cWe have a scheduling conflict \u2013 a public health crisis and the arrival of millions of people in Rio. What worries me is the possibility of tourists contracting diseases such as Zika and not being able to find sufficient support,\u201d the union\u2019s president, Jorge Darze, said.\n\nAt a press conference by the organising committee this week, almost every question was about Zika and the risks it might pose to athletes and visitors.\n\nThe organisers prefer to focus on the positives. Unlike the preparations for the World Cup, they say the stadiums and other infrastructure are on schedule.\n\nAccording to the city website the golf course and handball arena are finished, the main Olympic park and aquatic stadium are 97% complete and the tennis centre is at 90%. There are still concerns about the Velodrome and the Deodoro site, which will host BMX riding, whitewater rafting, hockey and some rugby, which are at only 80%. Organisers insist everything will be ready in time.\n\nThey are making similarly reassuring noises about the metro extension that will be needed to ease the usually dire traffic on the main road from the city centre to the Olympic sites. There are still several hundred metres of tunnel to be dug before rails can be laid and tests can begin, but the Rio authorities insist five new stations will be operational before the opening ceremony on 5 August. Improved urban mobility looks set to be the most positive consequence of the Games.\n\nRio\u2019s mayor, Eduardo Paes, said it was important to recognise progress linked to the Olympics, particularly with regard to public transport. This, he reckoned, is why there has been no repeat of the mass protests seen before the World Cup.\n\n\n\n\u201cBrazil is going through a bad phase, but there is still a Brazil that is becoming much better,\u201d he said via email. \u201cOne is not gonna come here and find a perfect city, we have a lot of problems. But the city has become much better, that is what is really inspiring about the Olympics.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Triathletes leave the water after swimming off Copacabana beach during training in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 31 July 2015. Photograph: Silvia Izquierdo/AP\n\nBy contrast, the biggest disappointment is the failure to clean up the rivers of sewage that are polluting Guanabara Bay (the site of the Olympic yachting event) and to a lesser extent, the waters of the Lagoa (where the rowing will take place) and the Copacabana coastline (triathlon and marathon swimming). The revitalisation of these aquatic environments was supposed to have been the greatest legacy of Rio 2016, but samples from the bay in particular have revealed hazardous levels of viruses and competitors in test events have complained of a sewer-like stench.\n\n\u201cFor a city that brags about its supposed sustainability, the Olympic legacy will be far below what was expected. Guanabara Bay is still a latrine,\u201d said conservationist Mario Moscatelli. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they had promised a Porsche V16 and are now giving us a Volkswagen 1200.\u201d\n\nThis is not the only source of frustration. Anger also lingers at the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo community next to the main Olympic Park, where residents have been forced out by riot police so that demolition teams can destroy their homes. While this is being done in the name of the Games, locals believe they are being cleansed as part of a strategy to push the poor to the periphery. Property developers have made no secret of their desire to make the Olympic village and nearby areas into an upscale neighbourhood once the event is finished.\n\nThe dire economy is not on anyone\u2019s side. Reflecting the climate of austerity, the organisers have had to slash their operating budgets by $500m, or more than a quarter of the initial plan. This has resulted, among other things, in a reduction of seats in the swimming and rowing venues.\n\nTicket sale income is unlikely to make up the shortfall. So far about 74% of the targeted income from this source has been reached. Tickets are still available, particularly for the Paralympics, which has generated far less interest than hoped despite ticket prices of less than \u00a32 ($2.91).\n\n\n\nGiven the cluster of crises, many wonder whether the mega-event will be good for the city.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen Rio was chosen to host the Olympics, no one imagined a situation like the one we are experiencing today. If the context back then was similar, I suppose civil society would have been far more critical,\u201d said \u00ad\u00adLuiz Antonio Simas, a Rio historian.\n\nBut others hope the event will be a distraction from the seemingly relentless daily dose of doom and gloom.\n\n\n\nIsabel Swan, a sailor, said the recent grim news only made her more determined to enjoy what she believes will be a beautiful Olympic party.\n\n\u201cThe country is passing through a difficult moment, with health, political and economic crises,\u201d she acknowledged, but added. \u201cI think the Olympics will be a breath of fresh air.\u201d\n\nMuch can change in the coming six months. August is the middle of Rio\u2019s winter and a low point for transmission of mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika. By then, the focus of the world\u2019s attention may well have shift back to sport as often happens once the first whistle is blown and the first starting gun fired on the track.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the Olympics will be a success,\u201d windsurfer Patricia Freitas predicted. \u201cZika doesn\u2019t compromise anything. Ahead of every Games, there are polemical issues, but during the Olympics the celebration is so big and nice that all the polemics are put aside, at least for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat forecast may yet prove accurate, barring a new twist in the Zika crisis, a further collapse in the economy, a deepening of the political turmoil or an Olympic equivalent of the 1-7 defeat. One or two golds in the early days of the event and the mood could change.\n\n\n\nGiven all that has happened to this ill-fated host nation over the past year, few would begrudge Brazil a clutch of Olympic medals. But no matter how many times its athletes reach the podium, it will be a long time before anyone repeats the old saying that \u201cGod is Brazilian\u201d.\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by Andr\u00e9 Costa", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea69c15c67cb4aee2700f8e34a7f0526861268c/0_0_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86f97623ef4fc2ba56bca60064132956", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c4eb0bc1462290bb3bbc72dae1b59f60b3102db/0_196_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fea3014df321087b1f42c63f5e1829a3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea69c15c67cb4aee2700f8e34a7f0526861268c/0_0_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8870d51b318ddbbbab26af97ac47c7db", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f9f2a27e0adfb409d4f59da43d80885d3fcce0b/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=50808e569fd17a94ba0cdb1c5e749b72", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+de+Janeiro%2COlympic+Games%2CBrazil%2CZika+virus%2CSport%2CWorld+news%2CAmericas%2CRio+2016", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea69c15c67cb4aee2700f8e34a7f0526861268c/0_0_4928_2958/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86f97623ef4fc2ba56bca60064132956", "date": "05/02/2016"}, "rank_56": {"title": "Deaths on collapsed Rio de Janeiro bike path deal safety blow to Olympic host", "text": "At least two are dead after a new seaside bike path was hit by a wave and collapsed, damaging the city\u2019s credibility ahead of the summer Games\n\nThis article is more than 3 years old\n\nThis article is more than 3 years old\n\nA newly built elevated bike path has collapsed into the sea in Rio de Janeiro, killing at least two people and dealing another blow to the city\u2019s credibility as an Olympic host.\n\n\n\nA huge wave swept away a 50-metre stretch of the Tim Maia ciclovia, which opened four months ago at a cost of 44.7m reais ($12.6m) \u2013 and had been heralded as a major legacy project from the 2016 Games.\n\nLocal media said at least five people were on the path when it crashed down into the sea.

Last week\u2019s needlessly late arrival of the team bus to Upton Park brought questions for Bulova, \u201cThe Official Timekeeping Partner of Manchester United\u201d. But at least United were at that stage still on schedule to finish the season on time. Since then, you may have discerned a little upset caused by what we\u2019ll class as The Official Security Search Experts of Manchester United.\n\nIn days gone by, time itself appeared to be a client state to the club, with temporal laws subservient to a higher form of measuring: Fergie time. Back then, United would finish top in April. Now, they\u2019re coming fifth in the second half of May. None of the above is meant to give the club what their own sources are promising the relevant \u201cidiot\u201d at Security Search Management and Solutions \u2013 namely, \u201ca right kicking\u201d. But I can\u2019t help feeling that much of the angst and the anger flying around isn\u2019t really about the pretend pipe-bomb fiasco, but about the post-Ferguson fiasco. Training devices are just something else to add to the long list entitled What We Talk About When We Talk About Fergie. Bombs in the bogs are the latest thing that many reckon \u201cwouldn\u2019t have happened under Sir Alex\u201d, though the thing of all things is obviously Europa League football. The training device is just a plot device. (Sorry.)\n\nNot that the public safety implications can be entirely dismissed. However Keystone Cops it appears to have been, the pipe-bomb/search dog exercise at Old Trafford serves as a sobering reminder. The highly complex modern security threat means we are effectively engaged in conflict and proxy conflict in any number of theatres, including the Afghan theatre, the Syrian theatre, and the Theatre of Dreams.\n\nEven so, the reaction to United\u2019s cancelled game against Bournemouth on Sunday still feels absurdly overblown. A furious Greater Manchester mayor and police and crime commissioner, Tony Lloyd, has called for \u201ca full inquiry\u201d. Really? There are surely enough really horrid things happening in the world without police overlords wetting their pants about false alarms. Still, if there is an actual inquiry, I hope Sir John Chilcot does it, because I\u2019d be quite happy for it to report in the new post-Ferguson measure for elasticity: Chilcot time.\n\nFurthermore, I know that the absolute last thing Mr Lloyd would want is for the furore over the bungled Old Trafford training exercise to obscure another criticised training exercise, this time one organised by Greater Manchester police. It was, after all, only last week that a simulated suicide bombing in Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre was chided for featuring a \u201cbomber\u201d needlessly shouting \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as he kicked it off by detonating his own pretend explosives.\n\nThere is no sense speculating on whether any of this would have happened under Sir Alex Ferguson, the former United manager having explicitly ruled himself out of mayoral contention last November. All we can do is consult our Bulova watches, and wonder whether a close season in Manchester bombing exercises is now due.\n\nOlympic pot calling the Fifa kettle black\n\nOf all the bandwagon-jumping lectures in the wake of the Fifa arrests in Zurich, the ones emanating from a hundred miles down the road in Lausanne were the hardest to stomach. To hear the International Olympic Committee pontificate at the time was to sense that a major tear had opened up in the sports-bullshit continuum. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely important for Fifa to regain credibility for Fifa,\u201d intoned the pious IOC president, Thomas Bach, \u201cso I can only advise that they work hard at reforms and work hard on addressing these grave allegations.\u201d By October he had upgraded to declare that \u201cenoughis enough\u201d, adding various instructions on \u201ccredibility\u201d.\n\nImagine the collective lack of shock, then, as we watch the developing fallout from Tokyo\u2019s successful bid for the 2020 Olympic Games. On Tuesday, the president of Japan\u2019s Olympic Committee refused to disclose details of its contract with a shadowy account named \u201cBlack Tidings\u201d, believed to be linked to the son of the disgraced former IAAF chief Lamine Diack. (Honestly, who calls their dodgy account \u201cBlack Tidings\u201d? You\u2019re a blazer, not Magneto.)\n\nEven accounting for creative accounting, though, the biggest con in the era of sporting mega-events remains the idea of Olympic legacy. I note that in the case of Rio this has now pretty much been commuted down to a single abstract noun. For your records, it is \u201chope\u201d. Let\u2019s see it in action.\n\n\u201cThis message of hope is perhaps the most important legacy that the Olympic Games will bring Rio de Janeiro,\u201d explained Bach last month. At the lighting of the Olympic flame in Greece, the Rio organising committee president took up the baton with the claim: \u201cThe Olympic flame means hope to us all.\u201d Does it now? \u201cIt brings a message that can and will unite our dear Brazil.\u201d\n\nWhat it doesn\u2019t bring, according to Moody\u2019s \u2013 which in February cut Brazil\u2019s debt rating to junk status \u2013 is any hope of affecting Brazil\u2019s deepest economic recession since the 1930s, despite the usual woolly suggestions to the contrary. As the credit ratings agency insisted firmly this week: \u201cThe Games will last just one month and the associated economic stimulus pale compared to Brazil\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nStill, you can\u2019t put a price on hope. And \u2013 much more conveniently \u2013 you can\u2019t begin to measure it.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Manchester+United%2CManchester%2CGreater+Manchester%2CUK+news%2CFootball%2CSport", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/01/10/Marina_Hyde,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6476202195914952e48ef41aadb116ff", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b7b2b296c8e1b5616db4b1ebdde1a5dfe3fe3b/0_331_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f29ca16a4323958657f3c4033a1bd903", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b7b2b296c8e1b5616db4b1ebdde1a5dfe3fe3b/0_331_5184_3110/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=381f63407c10e637880ca61bd0a5eca8"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b7b2b296c8e1b5616db4b1ebdde1a5dfe3fe3b/0_331_5184_3110/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=381f63407c10e637880ca61bd0a5eca8", "date": "18/05/2016"}, "rank_48": {"title": "Rio de Janeiro governor declares state of financial emergency ahead of Olympics", "text": "Forty-nine days before the opening of the Olympics, the governor of Rio de Janeiro has declared a state of financial emergency and begged for federal support to avoid a \u201ctotal collapse in public security, health, education, transport and environmental management\u201d.\n\nThe plea for funds is an embarrassment for the host of South America\u2019s first Games and adds to a long list of woes that includes the impeachment of the president, the deepest recession in decades, the biggest corruption scandal in memory, the Zika epidemic and a wave of strikes and occupations of government buildings.\n\nBrazil\u2019s economy is expected to shrink by about 4% this year as a result of weak commodity prices, low demand from China, political paralysis and the Lava Jato (Car Wash) corruption investigation, which forced the suspension of many construction contracts and led to the arrest of dozens of senior executives. Rio is particularly hard hit because it is the headquarters of the state-run oil company Petrobras, which is at the centre of the investigation.\n\nFaced by falling tax revenues, the state government has slashed health, police and education budgets. Teachers and doctors have faced lengthy delays in receiving their salaries, prompting strikes and occupations of schools and hospitals.\n\nThe acting governor, Francisco Dornelles, classified the situation in the Official Gazette as a \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d that could prevent \u201cthe fulfilment of the obligations as a result of the Olympic and Paralympic Games Rio 2016\u201d.\n\nThis is in part a political tactic. By declaring a state of financial emergency, the government is able to borrow funds without approval from the state legislature. The interim president, Michel Temer, has reportedly already agreed to disburse federal funds to cover Rio\u2019s shortfall and ensure the Olympics goes ahead as planned.\n\nThe impact remains to be seen. Most of the Olympic projects are funded by private companies or Rio City \u2013 which is in a stronger financial position \u2013 rather than Rio state. With the exception of the velodrome, the main sporting venues are either complete or on schedule.\n\nBut Rio State is responsible for the Metr\u00f4Rio extension that is already very late and is now due for completion mere days before the start of the Games, when it will be needed to alleviate the usually dire traffic to Barra de Tijuca, the site of the athletes village and Olympic park.\n\n\n\nIt was also supposed to clean up the sewage and other pollution in Guanabara Bay, which will stage the yachting events. But officials say that this is now impossible due to a lack of funds, which means Olympic sailors may have to dodge plastic bags, human excrement and other waste.\n\nOf greater concern for the 500,000 visitors expected for the Games is the cut in the public security budget, which has added to the problems faced by the favela \u201cpacification\u201d programme and contributed to a resurgence in violent crime. It comes amid warnings that terrorists could target the event.\n\nCity mayor Eduardo Paes insisted the state of emergency would in no way impede Rio\u2019s ability to meet its Olympic commitments and stage an \u201cexceptional Games\u201d. He stressed that the bulk of the bill for the event was being paid by the municipality not the state.\n\n\u201cThe city of Rio is in good shape financially,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cEven in a time of crisis, we keep pushing.

With all these economic and political crises, with all these scandals, it is not the best moment to be in the eyes of the world. This is bad.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut he also believes the problems are exaggerated by the press in a way that unfairly portrays Rio to the outside world. \u201cIt makes me mad. If you read the international media, it seems like everything here is Zika and people shooting one another.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy turns exasperated, combative and animated, the mayor defended the long-term impact of the global sporting circus that is about to descend on his city. \u201cThere has never been so much transformation for poor people [in Rio],\u201d he said during a two-hour interview. \u201cThe Olympic Games are a great inspiration to get things done.\u201d\n\nThe mayor \u2013 a political shape-shifter who has been in five different parties including the Greens, Labour and, currently, the centre-right Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of the interim president Michel Temer \u2013 also refuted allegations that his focus for Olympic investment has been only on the wealthier parts of the city.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to say there is no investment in poor areas,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people say this, they don\u2019t know the geography [of the city].\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rio has spent R7.1bn (\u00a31.7bn) on its Olympic stadia, including this beach volleyball venue on Copacabana beach. Photograph: Sergio Moraes/Reuters\n\nCritics claim the mayor is directing a disproportionate amount of Olympic funds towards the wealthy Barra da Tijuca region on the western side of the city, where Paes cut his political teeth.\n\n\n\nThis is where several of his campaign backers have major projects. One of them, Carlos Carvalho, told the Guardian last year he planned to make Barra the centre of Rio \u2013 even if it meant driving out the poor so a \u201cnoble\u201d elite could move in.\n\nThe mayor has subsequently put pressure on the elderly property developer to stop talking to the media. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with him,\u201d Paes now says. \u201cI tell him that every time you say stupid things, be ready because I\u2019ll be tough on you.\u201d\n\nPaes claims 75% of the city government\u2019s overall investment goes into the poorer northern and western areas of Rio \u201cbecause that is where I get my votes from\u201d. The bulk of the 331 new schools and 90 new clinics are in these areas, he said, as are the majority of the new highways, which will reduce commuting times for people living in favelas who work in the wealthy southern zone of the city.\n\n\n\nThis is disputed by social activists and academics, who point out that most of the new roads and transport links take people to and from Barra. They argue Paes is aggressively promoting the gentrification of the city, even if it means forcing many people out of their homes.\n\nThe number of relocations is fiercely disputed. Leftwing critics claim the mayor has moved more than 50,000 people \u2013 a higher number than any of his predecessors. Paes says these are wildly exaggerated claims spread by his political rivals. He puts the number of relocations in the hundreds for directly Olympic-related projects, or the low thousands if the new rapid bus systems are included.\n\n\u201cNobody likes to disappropriate people. It is expensive and messy. But sometimes we need to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paes, right, hopes the increasing use of transit systems around Rio will be a positive legacy of the Olympics. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nRio is said to be spending 39.1bn reais (\u00a39.1bn) on the Olympics, 58% of which is from private money. That includes R7.1bn to build all the stadiums (cheaper, the mayor boasts, than just one Olympic facility in London), R7.4bn on organising the event, and R24.6bn on legacy projects, such as the rapid bus system, light railway and new highways.\n\nFor him, it is a worthwhile cost to modernise the city. The main gain, he claims, is in transport. In 2009, only 18% of Rio\u2019s residents used mass transit systems. Now, the figure is 63%. Largely for this reason, he believes historians will look back positively on the Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s a great project for the city,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he admits it should have been better. There have been a series of mishaps \u2013 some tragic, others merely embarrassing, but all jumped on by the media. In April, two people died when a new coastal cycle path \u2013 one of the city\u2019s Olympic legacy projects \u2013 crashed into the sea. Although it was built next to the Atlantic Ocean, the architects chosen by the city government had failed to foresee that it might be hit by a wave.\n\nIn June, a new light railway also suffered a temporary power failure just a week after it was inaugurated. It also emerged that the Olympic velodrome might not be completed on schedule, though it should still be ready in time for the Games. More doubtful is whether the metro extension \u2013 a key element in the transport plans for the Olympics \u2013 will be running in time. After repeated delays, it is now due to open just four days before the Games begin on 5 August.\n\nThen there are longer-standing concerns about the pollution in Guanabara Bay, government funding shortfalls, and budget cuts that have prompted a police strike and a scaling back of plans to \u201cpacify\u201d Rio\u2019s favelas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A lot of construction has been delayed in the city, including a new light rail system in the Port Zone. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nMost of these problems, Paes says, are not the the fault of the city, but of the two higher tiers of government \u2013 at the state and federal level.\n\nAt the city level (stadiums, road transport and accommodation), the mayor insists preparations are going well. But at the state level (policing, water quality and subway construction), the governor has declared a financial state of emergency and begged for federal help.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, is in a state of upheaval while the suspended Workers Party president Dilma Rousseff is being impeached by the Senate. She will be replaced at the Opening Ceremony by her running mate-turned-betrayer Temer. Underscoring the disruption, there have been three different sports ministers since March.\n\nEven before this, Paes\u2019s frustrations became evident in a leaked police recording of a phone call he made to the former president, Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva. Amid a barrage of profanities, the transcript makes clear just how difficult the mayor found it to work with the state and federal leaders of the time.\n\n\n\nPaes: \u201cYou have no idea how I\u2019m suffering, sir. It\u2019s fucked!\u201d\n\nLula: \u201cBut with all the trouble, dear, you\u2019re still blessed by God with these Olympics, you see, because others \u2026\u201d\n\nPaes: \u201cIt\u2019s true! True.\u201d\n\nLula: \u201c\u2026 The other mayors I talk to are fucked.\u201d\n\nOlympic exclusion zone: the gentrification of a Rio favela Read more\n\nThe exchange highlights why Paes, ultimately, is so positive about hosting the Olympics, which have ensured preferential treatment and projects to keep Rio\u2019s economy moving even in the midst of a deep recession.\n\n\u201cThings are happening because of the Olympics,\u201d Paes said. \u201cEven in a time of crisis we keep pushing.

For the Olympics next month, he is planning to add a boxer and a couple of wrestlers to the sculpture, but he has no plans to abandon his sand goddesses.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the stars of the show,\u201d he says. Santos is looking forward to the Games and the hope of earning more money from the tourists who typically drop a couple of reais in an upturned plastic bottle in return for a photo, but his expectations are tempered by the reality of life in the Olympic city. \u201cThings are pretty bad here in Brazil at the moment,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping for a lot of tourists, and that things improve.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment is widely shared. Crisis-hit Brazil desperately needs an Olympic lift. After two shockingly awful years of economic decline and political turmoil, it is close to a depression in more ways than one.\n\nThe happy-go-lucky, funny, sunny stereotype of Cariocas \u2013 as Rio\u2019s residents are known \u2013 was always more marketing ploy than reality. But even the veneer of a joyful city has been challenged by a flood of gloomy news.\n\nSince Brazil was knocked out of the World Cup it hosted in 2014 with a dire 1-7 semi-final defeat to Germany, the national mood has gone from bad to worse. The economy has declined or stagnated in eight of the past 10 quarters. With GDP having shrunk by close to a tenth \u2013 the steepest decline since the 1930s \u2013 the recession is virtually a depression. Once challenging Britain and France for fifth place in world output rankings, Brazil is now in danger of slipping out of the top 10, having fallen behind India and Italy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brazil\u2019s President Lula da Silva, Rio 2016 president Carlos Nuzman and football legend Pele celebrate in Cophenhagen in 2009 after Rio won its Olympic bid. Photograph: Reuters\n\nThe political landscape is, if anything, even grimmer. In 2009, when Brazil won the right to host the Olympics, it was ruled by a popular Workers party government headed by a president \u2013 Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 whose approval ratings were among the highest in the world.\n\nToday the country is in the midst of an impeachment battle. Lula\u2019s suspended successor \u2013 Dilma Rousseff \u2013 could be thrown out of office the week after the closing ceremony. Her replacement, interim president Michel Temer, has approval ratings in the low teens and has already lost three of his cabinet ministers to the corruption scandal at the state oil giant Petrobras.\n\nFew sympathise with them or the dozens of other senators, deputies and business executives who have been ensnared in the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation, but the scandal \u2013 along with a collapse in oil and other commodity prices \u2013 has torn through society like a tornado, leaving devastation in its path.\n\nLava Jato: Brazilian anti-corruption minister quits over secret recording Read more\n\nRio-based Petrobras was the biggest company in Latin America and the biggest employer in Brazil. But in little more than two years 61% of its 276,600 employees have lost their jobs. The region\u2019s biggest construction company, Odebrecht, which is also part of the Lava Jato probe, has also slashed its workforce. The knock-on effect has hurt other industries. The unemployment rate is at a record 11.4%.\n\nAdd in resurgent crime, budget cuts, a Zika epidemic and pollution concerns, and there is little wonder that Rio mayor Eduardo Paes is already lamenting the Olympics as a \u201clost opportunity\u201d. But while they will not show the best of Brazil, there are still hopes that they could nudge the country over the worst.\n\nThe Olympics have partly mitigated the impact of the recession. Rio city remains far better off than most areas of Brazil. The organisers say they will spend 39.1bn reais (\u00a39.1bn) on the event and related infrastructure, 58% of which is from private money. The construction of roads, stadiums, a metro extension and hotels has created jobs and kept money circulating around the economy. Tourism is also expecting a boost from the 10,500 athletes and up to 500,000 foreign visitors expected for the event.\n\nBut even with these advantages Rio is in crisis. The state government \u2013 which based its budget on a forecast of an oil price of $100 a barrel \u2013 has effectively declared itself bankrupt now that its main revenue source, Petrobras, is lucky to get half that amount. Last month acting governor Francisco Dornelles described the situation as a \u201cfinancial calamity\u201d that undermined Rio\u2019s ability to meets its Olympic and Paralympic commitments. For Dr Luiz Ainbinder, a famous Rio psychologist, the optimism that marked Rio\u2019s successful bid to host the Games in 2009 has been replaced by a profound, if realistic, pessimism.\n\n\u201cCariocas are a very welcoming people, and throughout the Olympics there will be a kind of truce,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when the Games are over there will be a real sense of anger. The works will come to an end, and a lot of people will be left unemployed.\u201d\n\nEven before the sporting circus departs, some are already feeling its absence. With most of the building work now complete, the construction workers\u2019 union says it is receiving notices of 100 layoffs each day.\n\nThe hunger for jobs was evident last week at a recruitment event for temporary Olympic hires. Although the doors opened at 9am, the queue of prospective workers began forming at 4am. Among the first to arrive was Rosilene Leandro da Silva, who has not worked since she was laid off from her job at a garage shop. \u201cI have to pay the rent and support two daughters. I really need to get a job today,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nKaren Scavacini, a psychologist, said the number of depression cases she was seeing had risen \u201cscarily\u201d and suicide cases were also on the increase because of worries about work and money. She cited the case of a teacher who committed suicide last week after not being paid for four months.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, she said it was hard for people to get into the spirit of the Olympics. \u201cThere has been so much disbelief in the government and there is a lack of hope that things will get better. This is a stronger feeling than the excitement about the Games,\u201d she said.\n\nLike many others, she hopes this will change once the sporting spectacle begins. However, the opening ceremony on 5 August will not be the lavish festival seen in recent Games due to budget restraints. The creative director, Fernando Meirelles, estimates Brazil will spend a tenth of the \u00a380m that Danny Boyle was able to tap for the opening of London 2012. \u201cI would be ashamed to waste what London spent in a country where we need sanitation \u2013 where education needs money. So I\u2019m very glad we\u2019re not spending money like crazy,\u201d said Meirelles, who has promised a show that will be powerful but not flashy.\n\nThere had been fears that budget cuts would also hit security. After a decade of improvement in the crime rate, the past two years have seen an up-tick in cases of murder and mugging. A programme to \u201cpacify\u201d favela communities that were previously run by drug traffickers has been scaled back. Several visiting athletes have been robbed. After police salaries were delayed by the Rio state government last month, striking officers greeted arrivals at the main international airport with a banner declaring their inability to protect visitors underneath the pithy slogan \u201cWelcome to Hell!\u201d\n\nSince then, however, the federal government has stepped in with an emergency loan to cover salary payments and the deployment of about 20,000 military personnel to protect the main tourist areas and Olympic sites. This should dampen down crime in these areas, though human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch warn it may also lead to an increase in violence by security forces. In the wake of the attacks in France, terrorism is also a major concern, particularly given reported threats by Isis against the Rio Olympics.\n\nFar more than Zika, super-bacteria or pollution, this is the major concern of local people. According to a recent poll by the O Globo newspaper, 85% of Rio residents see \u201clack of security\u201d as the biggest threat to the Games. The survey also showed a degree of apathy about the event. Only 49% were in favour of the Olympics, although most \u2013 61% \u2013 felt it would be successful.\n\nBut there is also anger and frustration in the more deprived, less tourist-friendly areas of the city. In the Complexo da Mar\u00e9, a massive network of favelas that sits alongside the Linha Vermelha, the main highway from the international airport to the city centre, many residents believe the Olympics are just the latest in a series of mega-events for tourists or the very wealthy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Federal forces on patrol in Complexo da Mar\u00e9 before the 2014 World Cup in Rio. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010 the community has been fenced off from the highway by huge Perspex panels. The authorities claim they provide an acoustic barrier; the locals describe it as a \u201cwall of shame\u201d.\n\nLast week the city began plastering the 3-metre-high, 7km stretch of panels with Olympic posters, at a cost of 200m reais. \u201cIt\u2019s not to hide the favela,\u201d Rio\u2019s secretary of tourism told the newspaper O Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s to decorate the city to get it into the Olympic spirit.\u201d\n\nGizele Martins, a journalist and resident, disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s just another way of hiding poor people,\u201d she says. \u201cLike they have always tried to hide us away.\u201d\n\nFor Martins, aside from the possibility of a few extra jobs during the Games, there is no upside to the event.\n\n\u201cSince the Pan-American Games in 2007 we have been fighting these mega-events: the Confederations Cup, the World Cup, now the Olympics. Rio would have been a much better city without them; as it is, it is one of the most expensive and unequal on Earth.\u201d\n\nHer main hope for the Games is that there is no repeat of the security arrangements put in place for the World Cup, when the army occupied Mar\u00e9 for several months before, during and after the event.\n\nOthers are more unambiguously enthusiastic about the economic benefits the Games will bring.\n\nIn Rocinha, the huge favela between the tourist hub of the South Zone and Barra da Tijuca, the site of the Olympic Village, Maria Clara dos Santos, 52, is sprucing up her apartment as she prepares for a major influx of paying visitors. Her home is a striking yellow-painted building, halfway up a steep ramp at the top of Rocinha, with a spectacular view of the Atlantic ocean and the maze of frenetic activity in the favela below.\n\nShe rented out her place for the first time during the World Cup, and it proved such a success that her house has become a kind of stop on a photographic tour of Rocinha, complete with its own little souvenir shop.\n\n\u201cOf course, I hope to make a bit of money to invest in my place, but it\u2019s also great to swap experiences with people from all over the world, share a barbecue on the rooftop,\u201d she says, adding that she is now booked up for the period of the Games.\n\nFor others, the Olympics will be an opportunity to showcase talents they have spent years perfecting. For Favela Brass, a musical NGO that is described by its founder, Tom Ashe, as \u201cCity of God meets Brassed Off\u201d, the Games mean 16 days straight of public performances in various high-profile venues across the city.\n\nFor Marcos Carvalho, 14, a jazz fan who has been learning the snare drum and the euphonium over the past five years, it is a moment of huge excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be great for us to do all these shows,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take advantage of these opportunities.\u201d But even he acknowledges that the climate ahead of the Olympics is considerably more downbeat than it was ahead of the World Cup in 2014. \u201cThe country wasn\u2019t in crisis then,\u201d he says.\n\nCariocas notoriously leave everything until the last minute, and there is a widespread belief that the same will be true of their enthusiasm for the Games. Ticket sales have been disappointing over the past year, though they have picked up in the past week. Organisers say close to 75% of seats are now filled and a major advertising push will begin this week to lift this proportion higher.\n\nMario Andrada, spokesman for the Rio 2016 organising committee, said the mood was starting to improve as attention switched from preparation problems to sport. \u201cWe\u2019re still swimming in a rough sea,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cBut we are much better than we were. We are on the right track. I\u2019m far more confident, comfortable and bullish than I have ever been.\u201d\n\nOthers are not so sure. \u201cBrazil is an emotional rollercoaster. Either we think we are the best or the worst in the world \u2013 there is no middle. We live these positive and negative emotions without a middle ground,\u201d said Marcos Guterman, an author. He said it was necessary to recognise that Brazil was not wealthy or developed enough to host the Olympics, particularly now that attention is focused on other more important concerns. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a crisis \u2013 economic, political, moral ... With all these excruciating problems, the priority of Brazil is simply not the realisation of the Games.\u201d\n\nThe true impact of hosting the Olympics on diplomacy, tourism and trade can take a decade to spot, and official studies often stop after two years. Plus there is never a \u201ccontrol\u201d, to show outcomes without the Games. But plans for rejuvenated landscapes and kickstarted sporting interests can be monitored - and rarely come off.\n\nHost cities: what happened next?\n\n\n\nLos Angeles 1984\n\nThe Russians boycotted these Games in revenge for the American boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. All the bling was intended as an advert for capitalism and the Games did make money, partly due to Coca-Cola\u2019s sponsorship. Cleverly, they also built no new stadiums.\n\nBarcelona 1992\n\nTen years after the Games, analysis showed an almost 100% increase in tourism. Overall infrastructure investment, at $7.5bn, was the most expensive until Beijing in 2008. But the city, neglected under Franco, had already enjoyed a renaissance.\n\nAtlanta 1996\n\nAfter Montreal, almost bankrupted by the Games of 1976, Atlanta 1996 is North America\u2019s biggest flop. Intended to signal the city\u2019s arrival as a world player, the Olympics revealed Atlanta\u2019s inadequate transport system and sticky climate. Then there was a bomb explosion in the park.\n\nSydney 2000\n\nAn Australian study of the impact of the Games found little change in visitors\u2019 views of the city, other than that South Africans had gone off the whole country \u201cbecause of the way in which the Aboriginal issue was highlighted\u201d, reminding them of apartheid.\n\nAthens 2004\n\nNow the poster boy for failed Olympic legacy, as weeds grow up through its facilities. The Games\u2019 cost contributed to the teetering of the Greek economy, but did allow for modernisation in the capital, including the setting up of an international security network.\n\nVanessa Thorpe", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29efeb21a4840ea49abed8c0e373bee483e647c5/82_22_2862_1717/master/2862.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d9f51b178fb2bb3bb5f98625a42b410", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7a281882e8c18abc9194463172aa0661789cae/0_106_4920_2952/4920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8532b32c83e7635f4f05157d4a9feedb", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+de+Janeiro%2CBrazil%2COlympic+Games%2CDilma+Rousseff%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news%2CSport", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be451abef8a86a4669084d81b3583ca95ebfca7f/411_109_3009_1806/master/3009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=13cde6f1db0383a35113ce83665b9c80", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7a281882e8c18abc9194463172aa0661789cae/0_106_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d1d87fef78514404448c342d650b50e"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7a281882e8c18abc9194463172aa0661789cae/0_106_4920_2952/4920.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8532b32c83e7635f4f05157d4a9feedb", "date": "16/07/2016"}, "rank_34": {"title": "Revealed: the biggest threat to the future of the Olympic Games | Andy Bull", "text": "Drugs scandals and Rio\u2019s haphazard preparations have dominated the headlines but the most worrying sign for Thomas Bach and co has barely been reported \u2013 does anyone really want to host the Games any more?\n\nEighteen months ago the IOC\u2019s \u201cOlympic family\u201d gathered in Monte Carlo. \u201cThere could not be a more symbolic host,\u201d said the president, Thomas Bach, in his address, \u201cthan his serene highness Prince Albert of Monaco,\u201d the monarch of a state memorably described by Somerset Maugham as a \u201csunny place for shady people\u201d.\n\nIt was an extraordinary session, called to address \u201cthe challenges we are already facing and, more important, the challenges we can already see on the horizon\u201d.

Earlier in the year, Stockholm withdrew for similar reasons. Krakow also cancelled after a referendum found almost 70% of residents opposed the bid. For Munich\u2019s bid, the figure was nearer 60%. For Davos, it was 53%. In Barcelona, the mayor deferred until 2026, then canned the plan altogether. A similar thing happened in Quebec City. So from nine candidates, the IOC was left with two potential hosts. One was Almaty, in the dictatorship of Kazakhstan, and the other was Beijing, not hitherto noted as one of the world\u2019s great winter sports resorts. Beijing won, though most of the events will be held 140 miles away in Chongli.\n\nIt is not just the winter cities with cold feet. In 2015 the US nominated Boston for the 2024 Summer Games, until Boston withdrew because of low public support. Germany nominated Hamburg but it pulled out after the local government lost another referendum. Toronto\u2019s mooted bid was scrapped when its economic development committee voted against it. Right now, the four candidate cities are Rome, Budapest, Los Angeles and Paris. In Hungary, the supreme court has just blocked a proposed referendum. And in Italy, Rome\u2019s new mayor, Virginia Raggi, has repeatedly said she opposes the bid, and the Italian Radical Party has been gathering signatures needed to force a referendum.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The opening ceremony of the Montreal Games in 1976 was a colourful affair but the city took 30 years to pay off its Olympic debt. Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images\n\nYou do not need to be an academic to spot the pattern. But Christopher Gaffney is \u2013 a senior research fellow at the University of Zurich, he is a prominent voice in the anti-Olympic movement \u2013 and he describes it this way: \u201cWherever we see an educated population that has a relatively free press, relatively high levels of governmental transparency, and that has put it up for a referendum, in every one of those cases we have seen the Olympics be rejected. Without exception.\u201d In the west, at least, it seems no one wants to play host any more.\n\nThe IOC has been in a similar position before, after the disastrous Montreal Games in 1976. It took Montreal 30 years to pay off its Olympic debt. The upshot was that Los Angeles was the only city in for 1984. Because it was the only bidder, it was able to dictate terms. So the IOC was cut out of all the TV and sponsorship deals but it was able to turn to the sizeable profits LA made to its own advantage in other ways. It used it to incentivise other cities to bid. Five applied to host in 1992. Eight in 2000. Eleven in 2004. The IOC became \u201ca monopoly rights holder of a business that seeks to extract rent from cities\u201d, as Gaffney puts it. \u201cThey depend on having a group of cities competing against each other, raising the stakes.\u201d\n\nWhere there was resistance, it came from the fringes. In Amsterdam protesters posted bags of marijuana to the IOC\u2019s officials, then pelted them with eggs and tomatoes when they appeared in public. In Berlin a coalition of \u201canarchists, dropouts, punks, gays and lesbians, the alternatives, the stone-throwers, the fire-eaters, the grafters, the poor, the drunkards and the madmen\u201d marched in the streets when the IOC made its final inspection of the city. The difference now is Olympic resistance has become mainstream. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Gaffney says, is that \u201cthe more information citizens have about how the IOC works, the less likely they are to want to engage in that kind of business contract\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The beach volleyball arena at the Athens Olympics complex, photographed in 2014.

Earlier in the year, Stockholm withdrew for similar reasons. Krakow also cancelled after a referendum found almost 70% of residents opposed the bid. For Munich\u2019s bid, the figure was nearer 60%. For Davos, it was 53%. In Barcelona, the mayor deferred until 2026, then canned the plan altogether. A similar thing happened in Quebec City. So from nine candidates, the IOC was left with two potential hosts. One was Almaty, in the dictatorship of Kazakhstan, and the other was Beijing, not hitherto noted as one of the world\u2019s great winter sports resorts. Beijing won, though most of the events will be held 140 miles away in Chongli.\n\nIt is not just the winter cities with cold feet. In 2015 the US nominated Boston for the 2024 Summer Games, until Boston withdrew because of low public support. Germany nominated Hamburg but it pulled out after the local government lost another referendum. Toronto\u2019s mooted bid was scrapped when its economic development committee voted against it. Right now, the four candidate cities are Rome, Budapest, Los Angeles and Paris. In Hungary, the supreme court has just blocked a proposed referendum. And in Italy, Rome\u2019s new mayor, Virginia Raggi, has repeatedly said she opposes the bid, and the Italian Radical Party has been gathering signatures needed to force a referendum.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The opening ceremony of the Montreal Games in 1976 was a colourful affair but the city took 30 years to pay off its Olympic debt. Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images\n\nYou do not need to be an academic to spot the pattern. But Christopher Gaffney is \u2013 a senior research fellow at the University of Zurich, he is a prominent voice in the anti-Olympic movement \u2013 and he describes it this way: \u201cWherever we see an educated population that has a relatively free press, relatively high levels of governmental transparency, and that has put it up for a referendum, in every one of those cases we have seen the Olympics be rejected. Without exception.\u201d In the west, at least, it seems no one wants to play host any more.\n\nThe IOC has been in a similar position before, after the disastrous Montreal Games in 1976. It took Montreal 30 years to pay off its Olympic debt. The upshot was that Los Angeles was the only city in for 1984. Because it was the only bidder, it was able to dictate terms. So the IOC was cut out of all the TV and sponsorship deals but it was able to turn to the sizeable profits LA made to its own advantage in other ways. It used it to incentivise other cities to bid. Five applied to host in 1992. Eight in 2000. Eleven in 2004. The IOC became \u201ca monopoly rights holder of a business that seeks to extract rent from cities\u201d, as Gaffney puts it. \u201cThey depend on having a group of cities competing against each other, raising the stakes.\u201d\n\nWhere there was resistance, it came from the fringes. In Amsterdam protesters posted bags of marijuana to the IOC\u2019s officials, then pelted them with eggs and tomatoes when they appeared in public. In Berlin a coalition of \u201canarchists, dropouts, punks, gays and lesbians, the alternatives, the stone-throwers, the fire-eaters, the grafters, the poor, the drunkards and the madmen\u201d marched in the streets when the IOC made its final inspection of the city. The difference now is Olympic resistance has become mainstream. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Gaffney says, is that \u201cthe more information citizens have about how the IOC works, the less likely they are to want to engage in that kind of business contract\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The beach volleyball arena at the Athens Olympics complex, photographed in 2014.

Forget the 100m final \u2013 the contest for the host city to be ready on time is the most dramatic, high pressure test of them all.\n\nAlong with the Games\u2019 budget-busting price tag, host cities must also contend with the likelihood that most of the venues face white elephant futures. For those cities that do stay the course and win hosting rights, the months leading up the lighting of the flame can make the honour seem more like a curse. Far from being lauded, the host city and country are put on global trial.\n\nThis is now a well worn routine but even so, Rio seems to be doing it especially tough. The crushing Olympic expectation has been accompanied by a political crisis and a health emergency, and comes just two years after hosting a Fifa World Cup that left Brazil with a surplus of expensive football stadiums that are now being used as bus depots.\n\nSuch concerns weren\u2019t so prevalent 60 years ago when the Olympics first ventured south of the equator, to Melbourne. The ad-hoc, cobbled-together nature of the so called \u201cFriendly Games\u201d of 1956 stands in stark contrast to the mega-bucks nature of the event now and points not just to a more innocent past but, maybe, also shows that venues can actually have a more sustainable future.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ron Clarke of Australia lights the Olympic flame to commence the 1956 Melbourne Games. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nOlympic Park\n\nParks or precincts have become the hallmarks of the modern Olympics. As the Games expanded, organisers wisely decided to cluster venues together in order to reduce costs and improve convenience. Being the Olympics though, such straightforward thinking still lead to grandiose plans and gave birth to a series of grand urban renewal schemes where whole suburbs were turned into Olympic theme parks.\n\nKeen to out-do its predecessors \u2013 including London\u2019s Stratford, Sydney\u2019s Homebush and Munich\u2019s Olympia Park \u2013 Rio de Janerio will have four. Sixty years ago, Melbourne also had a dedicated Olympic precinct where most of the action was based, the difference being that it didn\u2019t need to be purpose-built. A few spruced-up venues and a bunch of rings and Melbourne had its own Olympic Park on the edge of the city, one whose primary venues still exist today.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest In honour of the 1956 Olympic Games, Foys department store decorated the front of their building on the corner of Bourke and Swanston Street. Photograph: Ullstein Bild/ullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nThe centrepiece, of course, was and still is the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which by the mid-50s had already existed for a century and already attained it near mythical status. It was across the Jolimont railyards on the banks of the Yarra where the bulk of the action took place and where most of the city\u2019s Olympic legacy lies.\n\nA dedicated sport and recreation area since the 1860s, the realignment of the Yarra River in 1896 created the park as it is today and marked the point from which it became the exclusive domain of sport. Its re-branding as the Amateur Sports Grounds in 1907 was an indication of where its future lay.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all high-minded Olympic ideals on the banks of the Yarra though. The gangsters, hucksters and bagmen who thrived in Melbourne in the early 20th century were keen to get a slice of the action and muscled their way in. A motordome built by local identities John Wren and Jack Campbell in 1924 hosted motorbikes on the track and Aussie rules, wrestling, rugby union and dirt bikes on the in-field. Hugely popular at first, the noise caused by the roaring motorbikes interrupted Test matches at the MCG and eventually the venue lost traction with the public. The motordome was torn down in the 30s and replaced by a boarded cycling track, and was renamed \u2018Olympic Park\u2019, a full 20 years before the label would take on a literal meaning.\n\nOnce Melbourne won hosting rights in 1949, beating Buenos Aries by a single vote, Olympic Park was modified again, with an improved velodrome installed plus hockey and soccer fields. The one major structural addition \u2013 and in many ways the Games\u2019 lasting landmark \u2013 was the Olympic swimming pool, erected on the riverbank at the park\u2019s western edge. It would be the scene of the host nation\u2019s greatest glories and also the site of it\u2019s most controversial moment: the water polo match that broke out during the Cold War brawl between the USSR and Hungary. The inverted pyramid design was an architectural triumph and won nearly as many awards as Dawn Fraser and co did within its walls.\n\nBy the early 1980s the pool had been filled in and it briefly overtook fellow Games venue Festival Hall as the city\u2019s premier indoor entertainment venue. A few years later The Australian Open was transplanted from Kooyong to the adjacent Flinders Park in a desperate attempt to maintain its Grand Slam status, and its retractable roof on centre court quickly turned the former Olympic pool into an also-ran.\n\nFinally, a fire in the late 90s put an end to its use as a multi-purpose venue and at the turn of the century it was taken over by AFL giant Collingwood, who promptly re-badged it with a sponsor\u2019s label. The Magpies have also taken over the neighbouring Olympic Park stadium, which for years was Melbourne\u2019s home of athletics and soccer.\n\nProfessional sports clubs taking over the precinct has upset some locals who believe it should\u2019ve remained the home of Olympic sports and stayed true to their amateur ethos. In truth, the area has always hosted a mixture of both. Years before Collingwood and the Australian Open moved in, the former Olympic velodrome was converted into a greyhound track. The dishlickers moved out in the mid 90s and the rectangular AAMI Park stadium now sits on the site, playing host to football and rugby.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The 1956 Hungarian Olympic team and Hungarian Sports Minister Gyula Hegy stand to attention\n\nas the flag of free Hungary is raised by an Australian Honor Guard at the Olympic Village in West Heidelberg, Melbourne. Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nWest Heidelberg\n\nThe exception to the relaxed lead up to the Games was the construction of the Olympic Village. Given the range of established venues Melbourne already had, it\u2019s possible organisers forgot that the athletes travelling from all over the world to compete at those venues might need somewhere to stay. So while venues like the MCG or the Royal Exhibition Hall were having last minute finishing touches applied, the athlete\u2019s village was still being frantically constructed.\n\nSet in West Heidelberg in Melbourne\u2019s north east, the Melbourne Olympic village was different from its predecessors in that it actually was a village. Rather than simply housing athletes in dorms as previous host cities had done, competitors arriving in Melbourne would reside in their own semi-detached houses and flats. This may explain why their construction was running late; they weren\u2019t building an Olympic Village but a whole new suburb.\n\nThe differences weren\u2019t just confined to the architecture. For the first time, male and female athletes would live in the same complex with only fences separating them. It may seem quaint now, given Olympic villages full of fit young athletes have been known to resemble the fall of Rome, but back in the mid-50s having both genders living together was considered a radical social experiment. The novelty was too much for one Greek pole vaulter, who was said to have used his skills to clear the fence in search of company.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An aerial view of the Melbourne that greeted Olympians for the 1956 Games. Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nInterestingly, this approach also seemed to ease Cold War tensions, which had provided the Games an ominous backdrop. After initially spurning the athlete\u2019s village for the seclusion of a Soviet freighter docked a Port Melbourne, the USSR were persuaded to relocate to the village. It proved an inspired move. The Cold War protagonists got on famously, apparently indulging in vodka and rock n roll parties, and going on joint excursions. The so called \u2018cultural contact\u2019 inevitably led to romance, too, with American hammer thrower Hal Connoly and Czech discuss thrower Olga Fikotova falling in love and later marrying. In the parlance of the time, it was dubbed \u2018detente at first sight\u2019.\n\nSadly, such happy stories have been thin on the ground in West Heidelberg in the decades since the Olympics left town. As was always the plan, once the athletes moved out public housing tenants from across Victoria moved in. The athlete accommodation was being used to ease the state\u2019s housing crisis. This seemed a noble idea at the time, but it soon became apparent that plonking thousands of people from inner city slums and emergency post war accommodation together in the one spot and forgetting about them probably wasn\u2019t a great idea.\n\nWest Heidelberg quickly became one of the most disadvantaged addresses in the country, with chronic levels of unemployment and violence making it a symbol of lost hope as the Olympic memories faded.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Downbeat American rower John B.

Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive\n\nWendouree\n\nNowadays the concept of the host city is an elastic one. The amount of venues required for the Olympics has meant events being farmed out to neighbouring cities and in some cases, across whole countries. In this respect Melbourne was a trailblazer. Its status as the first host city in the southern hemisphere and the conservative state of mid-50s quarantine laws meant that all equestrian events remained on the other side of the world in Sweden. Even non-equine events had to be relocated, though at least these remained in the same state.\n\nDue to a lack of appropriate venues in the host city, rowing and canoeing were among those sports to be moved. Albert Park lake was too short and too shallow, while the muddy, winding Yarra River was never going to be suitable for Olympic competition. Organisers had no choice then but to look an hour and a half north-west to the Goldfields town of Ballarat, set around the vast expanse of Lake Wendouree.\n\nEven here though, they hit trouble. Despite having hosted rowing races since the 1860s, a depth study found sections of the lake were too shallow for International Rowing Federation standards, forcing a 1954 decision to move further north to Lake Learmoth. This was an outstanding watercourse but remote and boasting little infrastructure, so organisers changed their minds again and went back to Wendouree barely a year out from competition. This time, rather than trying to make Wendouree comply with IRF regulations, they succeeded in having the regulations altered to suit Wendouree.\n\nThe faffing around meant time was tight to get the Lake ready. Extra lanes and starting bays were hurriedly dug out, while the Ballarat city rowing sheds were finally rebuilt, having burnt down six years earlier. Hundreds of Ballarat locals pitched in by hopping into the water and removing more than 50, 000 cubic meters of weeds.\n\nTheir energies were well expended. While not providing the gold rush of the pool or the track (it didn\u2019t produce a single Australian medal), Wendouree proved to be the most idyllic of all games venues. 30,000 spectators stood along the tree lined shores under pristine skies for every day of competition.\n\nThese days Wendouree is once again just a regional rowing course. When Melbourne bid for the 1996 Olympics it made sure an international rowing course in suburban Carrum was part of its pitch. Wendouree has struggled to host even local events since, having been completely dry last decade because of drought. But the Olympic memories survive on account of the grand white monument that adorns the Wendouree foreshore.\n\nFestival Hall\n\nIt would come as a shock to those who\u2019ve endured hot, sweaty music gigs there \u2013 an experience which has earned it the unfortunate moniker \u2018Festering Hall\u2019 \u2013 but back in the mid-50s the grey pavilion wedged next to the railway tracks in West Melbourne was a state of the art indoor venue that played a key role in hosting the biggest event to reach Australian shores.\n\nThen operating under the imaginative name of West Melbourne Stadium, Festival Hall was one of the newest and most modern venues used for the Games, despite not being specifically built for them. A mysterious fire in 1955 destroyed the old version, requiring a new venue to go up just in time for the big event.\n\nThe new and improved version would go on to host the gymnastics and boxing at the Games, the presence of the latter appropriate given it\u2019d helped the venue earn another nickname: \u2018The House of Stoush\u2019. When not hosting fights it had been the scene of glamorous balls and dinner dances, which attracted the city\u2019s great and good during the War and Depression years. Unfortunately such glamour didn\u2019t inspire Australians competing there, with boxer Kevin Hogarth\u2019s bronze medal in the flyweight division the only local medal won within its walls.\n\nThe disappointment was soon forgotten though, as the extinguishing of the Olympic flame heralded its halcyon era. In 1958 West Melbourne Stadium became Festival Hall and dinner dances and crooners gave way a new craze from northern hemisphere; rock n roll. Bill Haley and his Comets were the first big international band to grace the stage but it was in the 60s that its reputation was forged. The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who all played there, while Judy Garland, Bob Dylan and Frank Sinatra cemented its status as a showbiz mecca.\n\nThe transformation of the Olympic pool into an indoor stadium and the arrival of Melbourne Park made Festival Hall seem old and quaint. It now hosts rock, metal and alternative bands from all over Australia, for whom \u2018Festering Hall\u2019 feels just right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest D.A. Hodge of the USA and G.H.

They were simpler times in 1956 and such preparations weren\u2019t really required. Even if they were it\u2019s likely the Royal Exhibition Building would\u2019ve been given a free pass. Its credentials in hosting major international events were already beyond reproach, being the very reason it was built.\n\nPrior to Pierre de Coubertin reviving the modern Olympics in 1896, the major global events which cities clamoured to host were the various world exhibitions. Originated by London\u2019s Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851, these extravaganzas showcased the latest inventions produced by the industrial revolution and attracted visitors from around the world. Flush with cash from the gold rush and keen to show itself off on the world stage, Melbourne won the rights to stage its own world exhibition in 1880 and built the Royal Exhibition Building to host it.\n\nThe result was a gargantuan building that was grand and spacious. Set amid acres of gardens and featuring Byzantine, Lombardic and Italian Renaissance Architechture, its \u2018Great Hall\u2019 was its centrepiece. Annexes to the East and West and were augmented with a giant dome on top. It was the largest building in the world when finished, and still the largest in Australia when the Olympics came to Melbourne nearly 80 years later.\n\nStrangely for a venue so vast, extra annexes were often added depending on the event. For the Olympics, a stadium annex was built, which along with some temporary seating, were all that was needed to prepare the venue for hosting the basketball, wrestling and weightlifting.\n\n\n\nAll went off without a hitch, with the venue proving particularly adept at hosting weightlifting. Nearly 40 years later the world weightlifting championships were held in the building, while it was also called into use for Melbourne\u2019s Commonwealth Games of 2006. These events would prove the exception as far as sport is concerned, with the venue becoming more of an arts and cultural venue in the later half of the century.\n\nEven its original purpose of hosting large exhibitions has largely been outsourced to more pragmatic venues like the Melbourne Convention Centre. Awarded UNESCO World Heritage status in 1994 and fully restored thereafter, its towering dome, facades and arches now provide a backdrop for tourist snaps and weddings held in its gardens. Rather than playing host to attractions, the Royal Exhibition Building has become one itself.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest 1956 Olympic road cycling champion Ercole Baldini passes the finish line at Melbourne.

Given its inhabitants\u2019 traditional love of cycling and cafes, perhaps they\u2019d plump for the home of Melbourne\u2019s large Italian community, Lygon Street, and the surrounding suburb of Carlton. Actually, the 1956 road race took place in a location more used to road races between police cars and armed robbers than athletes chasing Olympic Gold.\n\nBroadmeadows. Yes, that Broadmeadows. The suburb that for decades has been a byword for urban decay and dysfunction; a hub of crime and social disadvantage; the living embodiment of struggle. That Broadmeadows. But like so much that has changed in the ensuing six decades, the perception of Broadmeadows in 1956 was rather different than it is today. Back then this benighted part of Melbourne\u2019s outer north was, as the name suggests, a bucolic location of wide rolling pastures and the site of an exciting new suburb.\n\nThe Victorian government of Henry Bolte had re-zoned Broadmeadows, turning a small country town on the city\u2019s northern outskirts into a new suburb full of public housing that offered families fleeing inner city slums or migrants arriving from war-torn Europe a shot at the great Australian dream.\n\nWith it\u2019s smooth new roads and undulating hills, Broadmeadows seemed an ideal place to host the world\u2019s best cyclists. Not everyone was convinced. Both the UCI and Amateur Cycling Association criticised the course as not being up to standard, with the roads not fully sealed until weeks just beforehand. Despite these grievances, nobody argued the course would be too easy. Starting and finishing on Pascoe Vale road, via Somerton, Mickelham and Broadmeadows roads, the 17 km rectangular course featured five steep inclines and two fast descents, which riders would have to complete 11 times.\n\nThe competitors weren\u2019t helped when race day began in farcical fashion. Three unregistered Irish riders were caught try to sneak into the field, causing the start time to be delayed. The slapstick continued when the race finally got underway, with the highly touted home team greeting the starters gun by promptly falling over. Riding first as per alphabetical order meant the Australians were placed at the front and pushed over by those coming from behind. Only two of Australia\u2019s four riders finished.\n\nOf the 88 riders who took to the starting line, exactly half failed to finish. As well as the challenging course, they were buffeted by hot northerly winds because the new suburb and its few buildings provided scant protection. Italian Ercole Baldini survived the war of attrition, completing the 187 km journey in 5 hours 21 minutes to take gold.\n\nThe lack of local success meant Broadmeadows\u2019 Olympic moment was mostly forgotten as the suburb developed. In 1959 Ford opened a giant assembly plant, which turbo-charged growth but also ushered in the kinds of problems that successive governments failed to address.\n\nSixty years on the Ford plant is due to close and young home buyers priced out of the inner city are moving in. What was once a semi-rural outpost is now part of the urban sprawl, with any trace of the Olympics buried by suburbia. On Pascoe Vale road, the start and finish line is now a driveway between KFC and Dominos. If you search hard enough, tiny clues of the past still peek through. On Belfast road in Broadmeadows, not far from the old course, there\u2019s a trucking company. Its name?

What is the point of the Games today?\n\nIn July 2005, a few days after London was awarded the 2012 Olympic Games, I took the Docklands Light Railway to Pudding Mill Lane. It was a journey I have repeated at intervals ever since, before and after the Olympics \u2013 but not during, when the authorities deemed it helpful to shut the station most convenient for the main stadium.\n\nEleven years ago this was an ugly, forgotten area full of grubby but useful businesses: small factories, reclamation yards, purveyors of obscure car parts. It had the kind of unplanned, bottom-up energy more associated with south Asia than London. Likewise the streets, which were filthy and (there was a heatwave) fly-blown. In the canal I found half a motorcycle. Under the railway bridge was a sign reading \u201cFuck the Bid\u201d.\n\nRevealed: the biggest threat to the future of the Olympic Games | Andy Bull Read more\n\nI made the journey again this month, as the Rio Olympics, which starts next Friday, heaves into view. I turned left as of old, under the now graffito-free bridge. There was still building work going on \u2013 for Crossrail and on the stadium itself, the new home of West Ham United. Within moments I was shouted at, hauled back and ordered to take a circuitous route into the Olympic park, now a huge grey, puddly open space, windswept even in July, broken up by its three main landmarks: the stadium, the Aquatics Centre and the ArcelorMittal Orbit, now half-converted into a helter-skelter, and surely the most repulsive piece of public art ever commissioned.\n\nThe canal had indeed been beautified and the \u201cpark\u201d was surrounded by trees, but uncomfortable-looking ones, just like those planted for the Beijing Olympics, which had the air of having been force-marched in from the countryside at bayonet-point. London has wildflower beds, but even these were regimented. The prettiest things in sight were the cranes over Stratford, creating unplanned, temporary geometrical shapes against the sky. Old Olympic parks across the world are habitually forlorn: two weeks of glory, decades of rot.\n\n\n\nThe Aquatics Centre does seem well used, though nearly all the water is divided into Olympic-type lanes for the dutiful swimming favoured by office workers, rather than the wet larks of childhood. A few people were in the Orbit. And the centrepiece of Sebastian Coe\u2019s much-vaunted legacy, the stadium itself, was about to stage last weekend\u2019s Anniversary Games, an event so important that at dawn on Monday it was not in the top 18 stories on the BBC Sport home page. Next month the stadium will go into regular use \u2013 unlike those in Athens and Beijing \u2013 as the de facto property of London\u2019s fourth-best football team: an almost free gift from the British people to that most deserving of causes, a Premier League club.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Two weeks of glory, decades of rot? \u2026 the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Games. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian\n\nI am not anti-sport: I have happily spent much of my working life as a sports writer. I am not anti-Olympics: I have reported seven Games in all, and have rich memories. I believe a passing alien would regard the event\u2019s existence as a tribute to our planet, the Paralympics even more so.\n\nI am, however, an Olymposceptic. I always opposed holding them in London, and never wavered even during the 17 days four summers ago when even my staunchest allies faltered. I felt like the man in trunks on a nudist beach; the unbeliever at a mass Moonie wedding. Late one night I bared my soul to a kindly colleague who had spent seven years covering every detail of the build-up. \u201cI drank the Kool-Aid,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt was the only way to cope.\u201d The London Olympics met no genuine national policy need, not one. But they were conceived under one prime minister who preferred the show to the substance, Tony Blair, and executed under another, David Cameron.\n\nIn 2012 Britain did not need to rehabilitate itself from utter national disgrace (Tokyo 1964, Munich 1972), nor impress its progress on an unknowing world (Seoul 1988), nor spend billions on a tourist advertising campaign (Barcelona 1992). There would have been a purpose had the Birmingham and Manchester bids of the late 20th century succeeded: rebalancing the economy away from the south-east. But they were always doomed.\n\nSochi 2014: the costliest Olympics yet but where has all the money gone? | Owen Gibson Read more\n\nNo lasting benefit from London\u2019s agreeable binge has ever been authenticated: east London would have been bourgeoisified anyway, if that\u2019s a benefit. The alleged effect on making youth leap off their sofas and on to sports fields was a chimera: a study quoted in the vital text on the whole Games-hosting industry, Circus Maximus by Andrew Zimbalist, showed that no Olympics has ever achieved that.\n\nAnd personally, I seriously doubt the endlessly quoted figure of \u00a39bn as the true cost of the London Olympics. Once Blair\u2019s original back-of-a-fag-packet numbers were junked shortly after the bid was accepted, this number became holy writ. I have no evidence to challenge it whatever, except my memory of the scoreboard in Greenwich Park, site of the equestrian competition. It was inadequate and barely visible. This made me realise the extent to which everything else was working brilliantly. On time, as it had to be, on budget, perfectly done. In Britain? No secret Treasury slush fund? No sleight of hand? Really?\n\nThe good thing about Britain is that the rule of law applies. The homes of the poor, the hutongs and favelas, could not be whimsically bulldozed, as in Beijing or Rio. The process of expelling the businesses, as detailed by the salmon smoker Lance Forman in his new book Forman\u2019s Games, was a very British one: furtive, grinding, mean-minded. I first visited Forman\u2019s old factory, close to Pudding Mill Lane, that day in 2005. I may have unknowingly trodden the same spot this month.\n\nForman got a good deal in the end, because he fought the various bodies driving the clearances hardest and longest \u2013 at the expense, he once told me, of actually running the business. Others accepted their fate and disappeared, grumbling, to new and less desirable sites in Essex and elsewhere. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand in the way of progress,\u201d as a more pliant generation used to say when motorways scrunched their homes in the 1960s.\n\nThe question that now has to be asked is to what extent the Olympic Games, in its current form, does constitute progress. London was a relatively benign example. Look at the bigger picture and the Olympics are failing on multiple levels: economic, political, humanitarian. And sporting.\n\nZimbalist cites 19 different reports from 2002 onwards showing that Olympic and World Cup hosts derived minimal or negative benefits in employment, tourism and general growth. The empty hotel room has become as much a symbol of the Olympics as the five rings. Mostly, as in London, this reality is tucked away under layers of propaganda, although the locus classicus remains Montreal 1976. \u201cThe Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby,\u201d swanked Mayor Jean Drapeau. That baby was 30 years old before the city paid off the debt.\n\nAwareness of the Olympics\u2019 dark side is growing. Brazil has been in ferment. Tokyo, the 2020 host, is restless. Boston and Hamburg had to stop bidding for 2024 because of protests. By the 2030s it will probably only be only egomaniac leaders, mostly unelected, who will even dare to get involved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Maracana Olympic stadium and a partially demolished favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nThe IOC loves to present itself as a force for good in international relations. But the Russian drug scandal is a reminder that, as in the three successive Games in the 1970s and 80s at which one bloc or another staged major boycotts, the Olympics can be an irritant rather than soothing balm.\n\nThe humanitarian cost? A decade ago the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) reckoned that in the previous 20 years, starting with 720,000 forced evictions before Seoul 1988, more than two million people had lost their homes to provide Olympic venues. That was before a final figure could be estimated for Beijing 2008, let alone Rio. Sadly COHRE now seems to be defunct; perhaps the office was demolished.\n\nSizewise, the Games are out of control. The IOC is beset by claimants \u2013 administrators for lesser sports \u2013 who are desperate for a slice of the action. The Olympics likes young sports such as skateboarding and big sports like tennis and, new this year, golf and rugby, though it degrades its own brand by staging second-rate tournaments. To the heroic zillionaire stars of those sports, the whole thing is at best an optional extra, often a distraction, and at worst a source of holy terror. (\u201cOMG! They have mosquitoes in Brazil! I\u2019m not going!\u201d)\n\nWhat the Olympics means for the people of Rio Read more\n\nAll this is in part an essential distraction because interest in the main Olympic product, athletics, is in freefall after decades of drug crises that the IOC has done its utmost to ignore. I have often spent the days beforehand asking locals which part of the Games they are looking forward to. The answer, almost invariably, is either the opening ceremony (which is interminable) or the 100 metres (which lasts nine seconds). It is rare now for stars to come from nowhere, like the eastern European gymnasts of the 1970s, to captivate the world. Each country seems to stage its own Olympics now, cheering on its own performers, mediated by its own one-eyed TV commentators and idiot interviewers (\u201cHow special was that?\u201d), ignoring foreigners.\n\nFor Britain, a gold medal was quite special in the days when the total haul was four or five. It was 19 in Beijing and 29 in London. And yet what we ought to know by now is that this is essentially transactional. Well-funded elite programmes lead inexorably to medals: an estimated \u00a34.5m per gold in London. There is no trickle-down; if anything these handouts sap money that could have been better used on well placed and much-needed facilities. If the number of golds goes back down to single figures, I shall treat that as a tribute to George Osborne.\n\nThe IOC used to deprecate the medals table: the concept of a nation \u201cwinning the Olympics\u201d was considered contrary to the Olympic spirit. But increasingly that\u2019s not what is meant by winning. London and Rio were deemed to have \u201cwon\u201d the Games by staging them, pyrrhic though these victories have proved.\n\nIt does not have to be so dreadful. It is this ceaseless search to find the next host that is most of all wrecking the Olympics, inducing cities to fritter billions on facilities that have no useful afterlife and destroy the lives of the poor who get in the way. The same process has produced such monstrosities as the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and, lying in wait for us all, the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nAbandoned Athens Olympic 2004 venues, 10 years on \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nFor the summer Games at least, there is a potential solution: returning the Olympics to its ancient home. Greece is ideally placed geographically. Athens produced a serviceable Games in 2004, after much panic, cockup and, doubtless, corruption beforehand. It is now thought to have a world-record number of venues rotting away to no purpose. Take away the need to start from scratch every four years and the event \u2013 even allowing for Greece being Greece \u2013 could acquire the orderliness and patina of tradition and calm programme of improvements that attend the golf at Augusta and the tennis at Wimbledon.\n\nOnce that happened, tourists would no longer shy away; billions would dream of attending the Olympics once in their lives, and millions would do so. It would also make a secure profit that would allow facilities to be built globally where they are needed. Yes, there would be downsides and implacable opposition. Much of that would come from US TV.

Students say the Games could have led to investment in poor communities, but are instead exhausting Brazil\u2019s development reserves\n\nIn August, Rio de Janeiro hosts the first Olympic Games on South American soil. But human rights campaigners have been concerned about the impact of the Games on the Brazilian city\u2019s most vulnerable communities. Residents of Rio\u2019s favelas have spoken of battles against forced evictions, police violence and wasted spending. We asked students to tell us whether the Olympics would be a benefit or a burden to Brazil\u2019s development. Below is a selection of the best responses.\n\nThe Games can play the role of stabiliser\n\nHosting the Olympics is a great chance to integrate the population. It can even become a starting point for people of all social strata to feel involved in something global and noble. That sense of unity can be directed towards reaching national goals, such as education and healthcare. In the case of Brazil, torn by political scandals and turmoil, the Games can play the role of stabiliser.\n\nNevertheless, sometimes the preparation of such great events cuts across the interests of local communities, which are sometimes deprived of their right to express considerations over policies. Often state media marginalise these groups, maintaining the wall of silence on existing problems. If authorities want to boost their international image by demonstrating an ability to hold great international events and therefore attract investments, the leaders should neither infringe the essential rights of the local population, nor use violence to push people aside to clear the land for logistics.\n\nHosting the Olympics should not go hand in hand with internal violence. The Games are a great tool of social integration, but they come and go while other issues frequently remain unresolved and even ignored.\n\nGrigoryan Gayk, MGIMO University, Moscow, Russia\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A resident of the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo favela in front of construction work for the Rio Olympic Park, in June 2015. Photograph: Pilar Olivares/Reuters\n\nRio does not need the Olympics\n\nThe Olympic Games is a nightmare for Rio as a city and for the citizens, who suffer [due to] the precarious situation of the education and transport systems, and in particular the health system, where people die from not having medical staff, basic tools for procedures and blood transfusions.\n\nRio de Janeiro is flooded with projects to revitalise the south zone, central Rio and Barra da Tijuca (where most of the Games are taking place) to create that image of the \u201cWonderful City\u201d to the international media and tourists. Behind all this, people die in the favelas in the north and west zones in Rio because of police confrontations with drug traffickers. They become just statistics.\n\nThe Olympic Games is a dream that became a nightmare. We, from Rio and the favelas, used to watch the Games and dream for it in 2016. This nightmare has come, and meanwhile, our mayor, Eduardo Paes, continues to cite the \u201cOlympic legacy\u201d. The only legacy I see is the blood of the poor people who are removed from their home to build stadiums (like Vila Aut\u00f3dromo), and the blood in the favelas as an attempt to [exert] control during the Games. I see the millions and billions spent on overpriced Olympics construction, which should be spent on education, health and projects for people of the favelas to have opportunities to grow and participate in the development of the whole city.\n\nRio does not need the Olympics. We need basic things that, unfortunately, are not in the interests of the politicians, who live in Leblon and Ipanema, facing the beach.\n\nLucas Rodrigues Alves, Escola Superior de Marketing e Propaganda, Rio de Janeiro\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Banners (left and right) advertise the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nThe favelas should be celebrated, not hidden away\n\nBefore the city secured the bid for the 2016 Olympics, the state\u2019s response focused on upgrading and improving the favelas. Through programmes such as Favela-Bairro, the state seemed to imply that the favelas were part of Rio\u2019s culture and identity and something to be celebrated. However, after the bid was secured in 2009, this changed.\n\nIt seems to me that when \u201cmore important\u201d issues arise, which can bring wealth and recognition on the world stage, the state\u2019s view on favelas and the poor is that they get in the way. They then get viewed as a hindrance to the vision of a global city and hidden from the media, the visitors to Rio and the rest of the world. It is always the poor who suffer from the inconvenience and expense of making the city a space of aesthetics and wealth.\n\nIn the case of Rio, a bourgeois environmentalism attitude is seen as the big players try to create a neat, clean and formal environment, an image the poor do not fit. But the poor communities and favelas should be celebrated \u2013 a lot of them are full of businesses that are generating income and contributing to Rio\u2019s economy.\n\nAmy Morris, University of Sheffield, UK\n\nConstruction in and around the Olympic Park in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood in Rio de Janeiro Construction in and around the Olympic Park in the Barra da Tijuca neighbourhood in Rio de Janeiro, from 2014 to 2016. Many residents of the former Vila Autodromo \u2018favela\u2019 community in the area had their properties controversially demolished, after receiving compensation, to make way for a road to the Olympic Park.\n\nThe Games are exhausting Brazil\u2019s development reserves\n\nWhile politicians are working hard to convince the world that Rio can and will succeed as a host for the Olympics, their eagerness for international recognition is leaving them ignorant towards the needs of local poor communities. The Games are exhausting Brazil\u2019s development reserves, in terms of both money and political attention.\n\nIn the light of preparing for the Games, the same red flags have risen that always make it first in line into development reports on Brazil. Segregation and violence are significant problems, particularly in Rio, but the city is doing itself a hindrance by hoping to fix these issues along the way for the Olympics.\n\n\n\nThe promotion of peace and universal values by the Games becomes uneasy in the wake of reports indicating police violence and forced evictions. The mayor of Rio insists that never before has there been so much transformation for the poor, but the authorities are also rushing with temporary solutions merely to safeguard the Games. The result could mean one step forward and two steps back for Brazil.\n\nKaren Laanem, University College London, UK\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Reflections of a mural on Rio\u2019s Olympic Boulevard. Photograph: Bruno Kelly/Reuters\n\nNow we can see the dark side of the Games for Rio\n\nI\u2019m torn between the positive and the negative aspects of the Games on Brazil\u2019s development.\n\nFirst, I thought this mega event would be a great opportunity for a country in need of a boom for its culture, its economy.\n\nBut now that the fantasy has gone, we can see the dark side of it. It would have been great if this project had included the population, creating jobs or improving living conditions. But it seems that the government prefers to cover all the \u201cugly\u201d bits of Brazil instead of deeply changing what is wrong.\n\nSo for me the Games is more a waste of money than a real opportunity for Brazil. Let\u2019s be honest \u2013 this kind of event doesn\u2019t prevent the authorities from investing in education, health \u2026 But with all this expenditure, how will the government find the money for the real people who need it?

I don\u2019t plan to get pregnant any time soon but, if I do, I will worry whether my baby will be born healthy.\n\n6 December \u2013 Rocinha\n\n\n\nTour operators treat favelas like zoos, but that might end soon. A motion to reform the \u201csafari trips\u201d through favelas was tabled in the municipal government today by councillor C\u00e9lio Lupparelli, who says the visits are arranged by companies from outside the favela who pay little heed to the cultural, historical and artistic aspects of our community. Instead, tourists just focus on degradation, poverty, violence and misery and leave without any interaction with local culture.\n\n13 December \u2013 Rocinha\n\n\n\nRocinha social networks were buzzing today with a community appeal to raise money for a family who lost everything in a fire. It is often the case that the community fills the gap left by social services. If we waited for the authorities, it would take too long because of the bureaucracy involved.\n\n25 December \u2013 Rocinha\n\n\n\nInstead of Christmas cheer, there was fear in Rocinha after a shootout between police and locals that left one dead and six injured. Jorge Arui, a 49-year-old merchant, was killed on his way to the shops to buy bread. Locals said the gunfight started after the police demanded music from a party be turned off.\n\nOlympic sailing ramp in Rio de Janeiro collapses Read more\n\n2 January 2016 \u2013 Alem\u00e3o\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s 5.40pm and I hear shots nearby. Over time, your ears grow accustomed. The volume and crack tell you how far you are from the gunfire and whether it is from a powerful weapon. I would rather not learn these things, but it is not a matter of choice: it is a question of survival. My ears are used to it, but my heart is not. The closer the shots, the stronger it beats. Each time, the symptoms are the same: pounding heart, cold trembling hands, eyes wide open and all senses on alert.\n\n19 January \u2013 Mar\u00e9\n\n\n\nThe construction of the Factory of Tomorrow School \u2013 a municipal educational project \u2013 is underway. It has been a long time since the authorities invested so much time and money in our children. The promises came only after they announced the World Cup and Olympics. It will be good to have more schools in Mar\u00e9 \u2013 but it\u2019s frustrating that our demands are not met without political motivations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ongoing preparation at Porto Maravilha ahead of the Olympics.

Our goal is to have this event recognised as one of the city\u2019s blocos or neighbourhood parades. Everyone met at the Lona Cultural, a hub for music and other events, in the heat of the afternoon and then we sweatily partied our way towards the Pontilh\u00e3o at night. This is an area that was taken over by the military but today we occupied it with dancing and festivity. The drummers kept up a strong rhythm, people painted their faces, mothers in brightly coloured clothes brought their young children along. We will have other blocos at the Pontilh\u00e3o. The police put their armoured cars there, but we bring baile funk and go to play at the nearby amusement parks and skating rinks. I think it\u2019s important to occupy these areas as a form of resistance.\n\n29 January \u2013 Rocinha\n\n\n\nMy sister, Monique, witnessed a shooting and robbery inside the Rebou\u00e7as tunnel, which links the north and south zones of Rio. According to the military police, a motorbike was stolen and the victim was shot twice in the arm. The incident caused panic. Drivers feared it was a mass robbery and abandoned their cars to run outside the tunnel. There is a frightening climate of fear in this city. People head off to work each morning, not knowing whether they will return home in the evening.\n\n9 February \u2013 Alem\u00e3o\n\n\n\nI go to a carnival party in Inha\u00fama, which ends in chaos at 2am when police try to drive through the crowd to turn off the sound. Locals throw beer bottles. Police respond with shots and stun grenades. For more than 30 years, the state had not been present in Rio\u2019s favelas, and now it is mostly represented by military police. The police can\u2019t be the solution because they are protagonists and lack legitimacy.\n\nI go to a party that ends in chaos. Locals throw bottles.

On my way to college, I am almost caught up in fighting during a police action. I take shelter behind a car and cover my ears. The gunfire is very loud. So is my crying. I drop my food and go to college in a state of shock. When I return home, there are empty rounds of ammunition on the floor. The news reports that 19-year-old resident, Igor Silva, 19, was fatally shot in the chest by an officer from the core special police unit. He worked at a local pharmacy, but the police insist he is a criminal. This is a day that makes me rethink my life.\n\n8 March \u2013 Alem\u00e3o\n\n\n\nLast night, there was such a fierce gun battle that I could not go home.

One resident \u2013 58-year-old Carlos M da Silva \u2013 dies after being dragged into a ditch. When it rains, the volume of water and garbage that comes down the hillside is huge. Residents say Carlos was trying to unclog a manhole and was carried by the force of the current and debris. He was a street cleaner and worked clearing ditches. He died trying to help the community, as he had always done.\n\n23 March \u2013 Mar\u00e9\n\n\n\nThe country\u2019s economic crisis is affecting many sectors of society. Teachers are on strike because of their low salaries. This has gone on for so many months that students have occupied more than 30 public schools to stake a claim to a better education. They sleep in the classrooms.

Among the fatalities is a 60-year-old Rocinha resident, Ronaldo Severino da Silva, who used to go for walks along that cycle path on his days off. The construction, which was inaugurated in January, cost R$44m (\u00a310m) but failed to account for the impact of waves. This is absurd because it was built on the coast.

There wasn\u2019t much information about the event, and not many people come. It is the first time the mascots visited Rocinha. Until now, there hasn\u2019t been any legacy for the community. Just marketing.\n\n12 May \u2013 Mar\u00e9\n\n\n\nOn the way home from my sister\u2019s house, I hear shots ahead of me. I call my mother to check whether it is safe to return. Later, I learn that a core special police unit has killed a local resident \u2013 24-year-old Oswaldo Rocha. This time, the lethal shooting doesn\u2019t even make the newspapers. Violence in the favela has become trivialised. People have a new topic of discussion when they chat at bus stops and in checkout queues and lifts: Rousseff has been removed from the presidency. And who will lose most from this? As always, it will be us. The vice-president, Michel Temer, who has taken over, has promised to reduce workers\u2019 rights. I\u2019m worried about what will come next.\n\n17 May \u2013 Rocinha\n\n\n\nThe extension of Metro Line 4, which will finally give Rocinha residents a subway station, has been delayed \u2013 and when it does open, we will not initially be allowed to use it because priority will be given to Olympic pass holders, including athletes, organisers and tourists.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The cable-stayed bridge that will carry the new Metro Line 4 subway line into Rocinha.

About a dozen officers have been convicted for the case, which was a turning point in relations between the UPP police unit and the community. Since de Souza\u2019s death, the UPP has lost credibility with the locals. The number of police officers has been reduced and the level of violence has increased. I used to think the UPP programme was good but, over the years, I have come to feel cheated. There is no point investing in security if there is a lack of other basic public services such as health, leisure and education.\n\n19 June \u2013 Alem\u00e3o\n\n\n\nOn TV, I follow the Olympic torch passing through several cities of Brazil. Nearer home, there is a major confrontation. Police are everywhere. I cannot leave the house \u2013 the shots are too close. Instead, I wait. Another resident, 31-year-old Roseli Jesus, has a different fate: she is shot in the back and dies instantly. Another local, 19-year-old Luiz Felipe Alves, has to be hospitalised.\n\nAhead of the Olympics, police operations have become more intense. More people are dying.

I\u2019m outside the favela, but my phone buzzes with messages throughout the day as people simultaneously report hearing shots at various locations. I don\u2019t know how to return home. One resident, Isabel Martins, is hit by a bullet in the Alvorada community. It wounds her arm. In a shootout in my own neighbourhood of Nova Brasilia, a police officer is struck in the thigh. Given the terrible situation, the best response from the government would be to remove police from Alem\u00e3o. The UPP has not worked. We want police who respect us as citizens.\n\n24 June \u2013 Mar\u00e9\n\n\n\nToday is the birthday of my older sister. We have spent the past week organizing a surprise party, but it proves difficult. We wake at 5am to the sound of shots. Live television coverage shows three armoured vehicles patrolling the neighbourhood. Amid all this uncertainty, my family decides to go ahead with the party. Outside, three men lose their lives. They are shot a short distance away from the house where we are. It is really sad to celebrate life amid so much death. But this is our way to resist.\n\n29 June \u2013 Mar\u00e9\n\n\n\nI go to sleep hearing gunshots and then I wake with them. This is becoming routine. BOPE special police forces have entered three Mar\u00e9 favelas. I have good news today \u2013 I have passed a college exam. But any joy I feel quickly fades when I receive a call from my mother telling me to be careful on the way home from work. I spend the rest of the day fearing that something might happen to my family and friends. I want to cry.\n\nThe police operation lasts more than six hours. It seems a police officer is shot. So is a bricklayer\u2019s assistant, Jos\u00e9 da Silva, who is killed by stray bullet.

But now, with the help of local NGO AfroReggae, Google has mapped streets, alleys and 3,000 businesses in 25 communities. This year, it aims to increase that by 25% with the help of community residents trained in digital cartography. Another digital-mapping initiative has been launched by the community newspaper Foreign Roca in partnership with the Memory and History Museum of Sankofa. According to the organisers, mapping is a way for the favela to assert its place in the city.\n\n1 July \u2013 Alem\u00e3o\n\n\n\nI am woken at 7am by shots that sound very close. The noise echoes through my little house. At times like this, I think about leaving Alem\u00e3o, although I love living here.\n\nOn days when there is shooting, the whole routine of the favela changes. The climate of tension makes it difficult for people to return home and even the mototaxis stop working. That means there is less trade and less money for many families. A single bullet can impact the routine of 120,000 residents here.\n\n12 July \u2013 Mar\u00e9\n\n\n\nAfter foreign visitors arrive for the Olympics, they will have to drive from the airport past the colourful murals on temporary barriers that hide our favela. Mar\u00e9 residents have nicknamed this the \u201cwall of shame\u201d. It was erected a few years before the 2014 World Cup. Officials say the barrier is acoustic and reduces the noise of cars. I believe that is a lie. I think they are attempting to deny our existence, which is revolting.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The \u2018wall of shame\u2019, which hides the Mar\u00e9 favela.

Alem\u00e3o was better off in the past when it was abandoned by the state. Now, I believe the state looks at us with the eyes of an assassin.\n\nI hope the Olympic Games is over soon because the only legacy I see is repression, militarisation and war.\n\n'Don\u2019t put your head underwater': visitors warned over Olympics pollution Read more\n\nTha\u00eds Cavalcante in Mar\u00e9\n\n\n\nIn the past year, the situation in Mar\u00e9 has become more intense than in previous years and everything indicates that this is because of preparations for the Olympics. On the one hand, there have been countless police operations. On the other, there has been more public investment in local culture. Community journalists have had the opportunity to tell the residents\u2019 side of the favela story, yet the commercial media continues to blacken the name of our communities.\n\nMichel Silva in Rocinha\n\n\n\nThere is a new subway station near our community, but this should have been built long ago. Apart from that, there may be a short-term boost from tourism. But what happens after the Olympics? Many of the subway construction workers are from Rocinha. Now the project has almost ended, they have been laid off. The building workers union estimates 30,000 people will lose their jobs. Meanwhile, the shootings continue. Over the past year, five residents have been killed and 14 wounded in shootings or violence. The government is trying to make the city seem safe for international visitors, but it is not safe for residents. I am glad the Olympics lasts only 17 days.

The shots are too close' | Daiene Mendes", "text": "1 June\n\nA new month, but the same old soundtrack. It is almost 11am and the children of the neighbourhood will soon be heading back from school. I see their parents head out to collect them. But on the way, their looks turn to apprehension as they enter the street; they look up anxiously at the sound of intense gunfire. This is happening now in the Nova Brasilia favela in the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o.\n\nAnd, from the window of my little house, I watch the street \u2013 sitting at my desk.\n\nFrom here, I can see the fear in people\u2019s eyes. Nobody knows when or whom the next stray bullet might strike. Our favela has many alleys, so each shot has the potential to find someone sitting at home or walking along the street. The odds are the same.\n\nAmong all the comings and goings outside, I notice a child accompanied by someone who appears to be a grandmother. The adult, long accustomed to the sound of gunfire, is walking quietly and steadily towards their destination. The child hurries along, eyes looking up fixedly at their companion.\n\nAt every step, there seems to be a burst of gunfire. The child, who looks about six or seven, starts to fire questions at the adult. Has it stopped? Are we done yet?\n\nDaiene Mendes\n\nThe same questions pass repeatedly through my head.\n\n4 June\n\nI have just seen about 50 heavily armed police in Grota, one of the busiest communities in the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o. In their black uniforms, they stood out in the middle of a small crowd. It is the day of the street market and the street is full of people, families, market-goers, bags and guns. It could almost be an ordinary day when nothing memorable happens \u2013 except that I was woken up by a police helicopter right above my house.\n\nIt is a scene I have witnessed many times. As if the general atmosphere of terror isn\u2019t enough, a black body wrapped in a sheet is carried out of the favela. It\u2019s strange how the militarisation of one part of the city is acceptable for a certain part of society. The police cannot mediate a conflict that it is part of. The UPP [pacifying police unit] project that promised the pacification of the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o has not worked for favela residents, who now have to live with this daily reality. Every time I leave home, it feels as if three guns are pointed at my head. This has to end.\n\n5 June\n\nJust before the UPP pacification began in Alem\u00e3o, many families were evicted from their houses. The government announced that new houses would be built for these registered residents. During the construction process, they received a monthly payment to cover their rent in another part of the city. In one of the affected areas \u2013 Favelinha da Skol \u2013 on one of the only walls left standing amid a mountain of debris, it is just possible to make out the words condemning the former state governor: \u201c[Luiz Fernando] Pez\u00e3o lied\u201d.\n\nThe monthly payment that was to have been paid to such residents was cancelled. These people have nowhere to live. The government lies to favela residents. It lies, not just when it promises they will live in peace, but when it promises investment in education, basic sanitation and culture. On the eve of new elections, posters and banners will appear, promising better days.\n\nRio Olympics: view from the favelas \u2013 'Going out to buy bread can cost a life' | Tha\u00eds Cavalcante Read more\n\n9 June\n\nGunfire.\n\n\n\n13 June\n\nGunfire.\n\n19 June\n\nJogos Ol\u00edmpicos do Rio: A vista das favelas \u2013 'Porque de legado, eu s\u00f3 vejo repress\u00e3' Read more\n\nOn television I follow the Olympic torch passing through several cities in Brazil.

This is because the police enter the favela [accepting that they may] kill. You can see it in the way they look at people, in their tactics, their fear.\n\nThe police operation intensified in the run-up to the Olympics, and so did the deaths.

But I respect this and even think that people have this as a hope, perhaps it gives the community motivation to carry on in the face of so many painful stories. I believe that the most respectful attitude of the government would be to withdraw their forces from Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, given the almost daily reality that I describe.

The streets are narrow and there are no tram lines.

One way or another, a single bullet has an impact on the routine of the more than 120,000 people who live here.\n\n6 July\n\nA mobile phone video of an anxious family in a cable car gondola listening to shots ring out below them in Alem\u00e3o goes viral. The mother, who is there with three children, shows the family\u2019s desperation as the gondola slows down because of the gunfight, making their journey over the danger area even longer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A young girl points to bullet holes in the front of her house in the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o. Photograph: Peter Bauza/Alamy\n\n19 July\n\nThe last two months have been very tense in Alem\u00e3o. Over the past 48 days I have counted at least 25 days where a gunfight was reported in different communities in Alem\u00e3o. Since the beginning of June, two residents have been killed in the shooting and another five, including two police, have been injured.\n\nMy feeling is that Alem\u00e3o was better off in the past when it was abandoned [by the state]. Now, I believe the state looks at us with the eyes of an assassin. A common saying among our group of social activists in Alem\u00e3o goes like this: we ask for public healthcare and the authorities send police. We ask for more culture, the government understands \u201cpolice\u201d. When we ask for better transport so we can reach other parts of the city, the state hears \u201cpolice\u201d. We ask for peace, but all we get is war.\n\nI hope the Olympic Games are over soon because the only legacy I see is repression, militarisation and war.

We should channel all this energy and all this resource not only to make sure the facilities and venues are ready, but also to look at how this could actually be used to make progress in terms of human rights and equality \u2013 especially in a country like Brazil that has such deep schisms,\u201d he said. Previously he had been speaking at an event where a succession of speakers \u2013 including victims of forced relocation and the upsurge in police violence linked to the hosting of major sporting events \u2013 lamented the scale of the opportunity missed.\n\nAmid the broader promises loaded on to Rio as they have been on to every other recent Games until they threaten to collapse under their own weight, there was one specific promise that has not been kept. \u201cThey explicitly said they would use the Olympics to improve public security and that was not done. They fell in their usual trap of falling into the usual politics of fear,\u201d Roque said.\n\n\u201cThey used it to increase the number of operations, to focus on criminalising a certain group of people instead of using it as an opportunity to change. We see a war against the poor, a war against the favelas, a war against the young black men who live there. It ends up reinforcing all kinds of stereotypes. That\u2019s why I see it as a huge missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nAmong a blizzard of statistics, one stood out: since 2009 when Rio got the go-ahead in Copenhagen amid tears of joy and optimism from the then president Lula, and the former footballer Pel\u00e9, there have been more than 2,600 police killings in Rio.\n\nWhile the Games cannot be a panacea for a city\u2019s problems, the campaign groups under the Sport and Rights Alliance umbrella \u2013 Terre des Hommes, Amnesty International, Football Supporters Europe, Human Rights Watch, the International Trade Union Confederation, Transparency International Germany and UNI Global Union \u2013 argue that at the least it should not exacerbate them.\n\nYet Amnesty\u2019s Renata Neder said there had been an increase of 103% year-on-year in the number of killings in Rio\u2019s favelas and the upturn was part of a pattern in which periodic attempts to take a long-term approach were short-circuited by the perceived need for a crackdown.\n\nIn 2007, when Rio hosted the Pan-American Games, there was a rise of 30%. In 2014, when Brazil hosted the World Cup it was preceded by huge public demonstrations over the strain on the public purse, and there was a rise of 40%.\n\n\u2018The only Olympic legacy I see is repression and war\u2019 \u2013 a year in the life of Rio\u2019s favelas Read more\n\nThe huge sprawling favela of Mare, close to the airport, was occupied by police and the military in the run-up to the World Cup. Once there, they stayed, resulting in an escalation of tensions and leading to innocent people being caught in the crossfire.\n\nOne of those victims was Vitor Santiago, a 30-year-old shot in the back by police after his car was cleared at a checkpoint. \u201cThe police stopped the car, searched the car and found nothing wrong. They decided to shoot at random. I was shot in the back. It went through my lungs, it reached my spine and I was a paraplegic. I was shot again in the leg and I had to amputate my left leg because both injuries were caused by a very high calibre bullets.\u201d\n\nMe, my family, we are good people. They entered our community and they were quite aggressive. We had tanks and barricades and barbed wire. It was like a war. We were very much afraid and it affected the way I lived,\u201d said Santiago, who spent 98 days in hospital and was given only a 7% chance of survival.\n\n\u201cThe police, the soldiers accepted the blame for what happened and we have to go after our rights. The government and the state have given me nothing, not even a band aid. My bed and my wheelchair were donated by the community. The diapers I still use today were also a donation,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Olympic Park is seen from a partially demolished house in the Vila Autodromo favela. Photograph: Ricardo Moraes / Reuters/Reuters\n\n\u201cWe are still fighting, we are not afraid. The army and police are back at the entrance of my community. We are not afraid of them. I want to tell you what happened to me because what happened was during the World Cup and now we are hosting the Olympics.\u201d\n\nWhile it is important not to simplify a complex issue, in broad terms critics argue that any progress made in seeking to break down barriers between police and communities has been set back by the overriding imperative to aggressively crack down before the World Cup and Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe sporting authorities did not learn from the Pan American Games or the World Cup and did not put in place any measures to stop this happening again in the run up to the Olympics,\u201d said Neder.\n\n\u201cThe candidacy documents of Rio 2016 had two important parts on public security. One was their plans for the Games and the other was the legacy. We say they are failing on both. The plans for the Games are causing human rights violations and there is no legacy. When Rio applied to be the host city, they promised a legacy of public security and a safe city for our residents. They have failed.\u201dAndrea Florence, a lawyer with the children\u2019s rights organisation Terre des Hommes, highlighted the scale of evictions as a result of the wave of redevelopment related to the grand plan to use sporting events to reverse 30 years of decline in Rio\u2019s infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIn Rio alone, more than 22,000 families have been removed since 2009, according to official statistics. This was the biggest wave of removals Rio has ever seen. Our message is clear: the Olympic Games should never harm families or children,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThough the host city bears ultimate responsibility for human-rights violations, sports governing bodies such as the IOC are also obliged to respect human rights.\u201d\n\nThe focus has been on the long, bitter battle over the fate of Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, a small community that sat cheek by jowl with the Olympic Park. The road that runs up to a new Marriott hotel and a vast car park is now called Rua Vila Aut\u00f3dromo.\n\n\u201cThere were originally around 600 families but when Rio won the Olympics pressure from city hall to vacate the premises intensified,\u201d Florence said. \u201cThat led to energy cuts, lack of clean water, rubble left lying around and police violence during forced evictions. To put it bluntly, Vila Aut\u00f3dromo resembled a war zone.\u201d\n\nDuring a long and bitter battle most people left for new housing \u2013 with the mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, claiming the majority were happy to do so \u2013 but a rump of around 20 remained long enough to be granted permission to stay. \u201cEduardo Paes decided things had to be done that way and we had to be relocated. They came in with all the police and relocated us. They came along and put all of our belongings in storage as if we were dogs,\u201d saidNaomy Oliveira, who is now 14 and relocated along with her family.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest How the Vila Aut\u00f3dromo looks now in its new guise at the Rio Olympic Park Photograph: Wolfgang Rattay/Reuters\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m grown up and I have to know what life is about and not be manipulated by governments. This was an experience for me to learn. I am older now.\u201d\n\nRegeneration of this sprawling, beautiful, crumbling city is clearly long overdue. Handled in the right way, major events could have even been part of the catalyst for it but the way in which it has been achieved has not benefited its poorest inhabitants.\n\nThe battle over Rio\u2019s legacy will be keenly fought. It\u2019s thrusting, ambitious mayor will point to the swish new metro line \u2013 opened just before the Games as promised \u2013 and redevelopment of the old port area as evidence the Games have delivered.\n\nOthers see the privately financed schemes as evidence they are delivering for only a very small strata of society.\n\nDespite its travails, the IOC has at least acknowledged it needs to engage with those pressing for change. However, the warm words of the IOC\u2019s hitherto unimpressive Agenda 2020 reform programme need to be converted into contractual clauses in the 2024 host city contracts if they are to have any meaning.\n\nSylvia Schenk of Transparency International said there were signs of progress but that the IOC\u2019s woes had slowed things down.\n\n\u201cIn April this year we sent a letter to IOC president, Thomas Bach, asking the IOC to prevent from the very beginning of the bidding stage to prevent human-rights abuses, children\u2019s rights abuses and corruption. Our aim is to impact on the preparations for the Olympic Games in 2018, 2020 and 2022 but above all to impact on the awarding of future Games,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to influence the host city contract \u2013 obligations are laid down. It is very important to have a host city contract that is very clear on human rights, abuses of the local population and anti-corruption.\u201d\n\nWith protests planned ahead of Friday\u2019s opening ceremony, the tensions at the heart of the modern Olympics and the gap between what they promise and what they ultimately deliver for those in the city that hosts them are not going to go away.\n\n\u201cThe IOC is in a situation of scandal and crisis, but it is also a situation for change as well. We have a clear commitment to engage with the IOC and will have a workshop in autumn,\u201d Schenk said. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s important the Olympics send a clear message on human rights, children\u2019s rights and corruption.

Beijing had to spend tens of millions of dollars closing factories, banning cars and trying to engineer the weather. Air pollution was thrust on to the world stage and has stayed there ever since.\n\nNow it\u2019s Rio\u2019s turn to host the Games and attention has turned to water and basic sanitation. Parts of Guanabara Bay, which will host aquatic events, are teeming with dangerous viruses and bacteria, threatening the athletes as well as the 350,000 spectators who may want a dip in the sea.\n\n\u2018The only Olympic legacy I see is repression and war\u2019 \u2013 a year in Rio\u2019s favelas Read more\n\nRio has the image of a rich, beautiful city, but its crowded hospitals testify to the nightmare of its sanitation for people who must live with urban pollution every day. One in three of the more than 10 million inhabitants of the greater metropolitan area live in places that have no connection to a sewerage system, and only about half of the city\u2019s waste is treated before entering waterways and eventually the ocean.\n\nNot surprisingly, diarrheal diseases and childhood sickness are rife. The many rivers that flow through Rio\u2019s sprawling urban areas into Guanabara Bay were declared biologically dead by scientists years ago and tonnes of raw sewage pour into the sea every day. There are high levels of viruses and algal blooms in the water, as well as industrial contamination and floating debris. A succession of city authorities has promised, tried and failed to clean it up.\n\nIn Beijing, a wealthy, authoritarian government could simply ban cars and close down factories for the few weeks of the Games and restart them when people went home. But sorting out basic sanitation and hygiene in crowded, chaotic Rio with its many favelas, steep slopes and a cash-strapped administration is far harder. It involves cultural change, huge costs, many different technologies and immense disruption.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Girls sit near the shores of Guanabara Bay, the venue for sailing at Rio 2016. Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP\n\nTo widespread community anger, only one waste treatment plant is fully in operation instead of the seven pledged by the city when it bid for the Olympics in 2007. Instead of sanitation being extended to 80% of people, as promised, vast money has been spent on highly visible cable cars, beautification and facilities for tourists and athletes rather than on basic services like waste collection and sewers. Unsurprisingly there have been protests.\n\n\n\nThere should be no excuses because Rio won its bid to host the Olympics in 2009, giving it years to make good its promises. Nevertheless, some progress has been made. When, a few years ago, the city began to realise it was falling well behind on its Olympic pledges, consultants were called in, and a myriad of solutions proposed. The World Bank, the Dutch development bank and many others all contributed ideas and money, and more than 20 separate major proposals to deal with Rio\u2019s water pollution and solid waste challenges were accepted. A million more people are now connected to the sewers than 10 years ago and this will increase over the next decade.\n\nBut Rio is like 1,000 other cities grappling to improve its infrastructure. Rapid industrialisation, population growth and lack of money have overwhelmed local authorities all over the world. About 2.4 billion people still live without decent sanitation facilities, and the target in the millennium development goals to halve the proportion of the population without basic sanitation was missed by nearly 700 million people.\n\nWhat's in the water? Pollution fears taint Rio's picturesque bay ahead of Olympics Read more\n\nThis week, Eduardo Paes, the mayor of Rio who also chairs the C40 initiative of global mayors trying to improve the environment of their cities, accepted that Guanabara Bay is not in the pristine state envisaged in 2007.\n\nBut he said the city is in a far better state than 10 years ago. Gramacho, Latin America\u2019s largest open landfill, has been closed down, public transport extended and improved, 450km of cycle track built, CO2 emissions reduced, old neighbourhoods improved and mangroves restored.\n\n\u201cFor every one real we have spent on the Games, we have invested five on ensuring a legacy for the city, through sustainable infrastructure, improved public transport and accessible facilities for our citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nPaes welcomes the international scrutiny of the city. \u201cThe process of preparing for the Games has brought attention to the issues of pollution, waste management and water usage, triggering a discussion within the city and at the state and national level,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Olympics are just the beginning.

The officer was injured.\n\nThe situation in the north, however, is of the greatest immediate concern. Since Friday, there have been more than 90 attacks, according to local media, in conflict that is believed to have been sparked by the local government\u2019s decision to jam cellphone coverage in Parnamirim prison.\n\nBanks and public buildings in the state capital, Natal, have been raked with machine gun fire, 27 buses have been torched and one landmark \u2013 the Morro do Careca \u2013 has been vandalised. The latest incident occurred on Wednesday morning, when a police station was set on fire. There have also been arson attacks on schools and an environmental agency boat.\n\n\n\nLocal media say some districts of Natal are under curfew and bus services have been curtailed because drivers do not feel safe unless they have a police escort.\n\nAt the request of the state governor, the interim president, Michel Temer, has authorized 1,000 soldiers and 200 marines to bolster security. The reinforcements began arriving on Wednesday. The defense minister, Raul Jungmann, was due to visit Natal on Thursday to monitor the situation.\n\nPolice have also arrested dozens of gang members, including the alleged second in command of the gang, Daniel Carvalho Silva. Several Parnamirim inmates \u2013 who are believed to have ordered the attacks \u2013 have been transferred to another prison.\n\nNatal is more than 2,500km from the Olympic host city, Rio de Janeiro, but the breakdown of public order is an embarrassment to the host nation and highlights the broader problems of high crime rates and inequality that plague almost all cities in Brazil.\n\n\u2018The only Olympic legacy I see is repression and war\u2019 \u2013 a year in Rio\u2019s favelas Read more\n\nRio\u2019s own longstanding problem of violence continued on Wednesday in the latest gunfight between police and drug traffickers in the Alem\u00e3o favela, a centre for the the city\u2019s biggest gang Comando Vermelho (Red Command) that lies close to the international airport.\n\nMore than 400 officers were deployed to the community to arrest 23 alleged gangsters.

More of a jolt \u2013 at least to US site FiveThirtyEight \u2013 has been the lack of interest in the women\u2019s game in Brazil itself.

You can now live, work and play in the Olympic legacy, and shop and eat there too, while marvelling at the cranes busy summoning further chunks of legacy from the ground. That London has a lasting physical inheritance from its two-week \u00a312bn jamboree is indisputable, but what kind of place is the promised Legacy-land turning out to be? So far, it\u2019s an odd one. It is somewhere that feels more like an accidental suburban campus than a real piece of London \u2013 a place where the different functions that make up a city have been separated out, each built without much thought given to how they relate.\n\n\n\nIn the New York Times, John Branch talks to the lifeguards who keep a watchful eye on the Olympic pools:\n\nDuring a training this week, [Michael] Phelps cruised past, stroke after stroke, lap after lap, training for the competition that begins on Saturday. The arena was mostly empty, with just a smattering of coaches, volunteers and security guards. But watching most intensely from opposite sides of the pool deck were two men in red trunks, with whistles around their necks and flotation devices tucked beneath their arms.\n\nThey never used their whistles. They never once yelled at the Olympians to stop running on the pool deck. They never flinched toward action, or even felt their hearts skip a beat faster at the sudden and momentary possibility \u2013 is she still underwater? \u2013 that someone might need saving. \u2018I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll need us, but we\u2019ll be on the lookout just in case.\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An unneeded lifeguard watches US water polo team members Courtney Mathewson (L) and Maddie Musselman (R) after their practice at the aquatics stadium.

Dr [Martin] Cetron [director of global migration and quarantine for the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention] says the risk of contracting the flu, a gastrointestinal illness, or even measles or hepatitis if you\u2019re not up to date on vaccines is higher than the risk of getting Zika \u2018by a long shot\u2019. The CDC warns Rio-bound travelers of all of these health risks on the same page as Zika.

Parents brought their children. Some held aloft promotional gifts from the sponsors: inflatable plastic torches from a Brazilian bank, red and white waving mittens from a global drinks company.\n\n\u201cI wanted my son to see this. He loves sport and we\u2019ve never had an event like this here before,\u201d said Silene dos Santos, who had come with her 13-year-old boy.\n\nThere were also about 50 protesters, who were taking the opportunity of the relay to raise a plethora of grievances.\n\n\u201cGive up the torch. We\u2019d rather have the money for health and education,\u201d they chanted.\n\nSome were teachers and school administrators who carried banners demanding payment of salaries, which have been held up for weeks because the Rio state government is almost bankrupt.\n\nOthers held up signs saying \u201cFora Temer\u201d (Temer Out!) addressed to the interim president, Michel Temer, who has taken power during the ongoing impeachment of the Workers\u2019 party leader, Dilma Rousseff.\n\n\u201cRio is in debt. The Olympics have made things worse,\u201d said Josy Louzada, a librarian. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the money for this. We don\u2019t have enough books in our schools. When it rains, the ceiling leaks and drips on to the students.\u201d\n\nDespite such frustrations, the demonstration was good natured.\n\nPolice, who have also suffered salary delays until an emergency infusion of cash from federal coffers to ensure Olympic security, kept their distance. \u201cThey will have their own protest on Friday,\u201d said Louzada.\n\nElsewhere, however, the protests on Wednesday night were proving more disruptive and the security forces more violent. At Duque de Caxias, which borders Rio, military police used teargas to disperse crowds and fired rubber bullets at bystanders, hurting a 10-year-old girl.\n\nThe torch was extinguished at least three times \u2013 as it has been on several occasions throughout the relay. A few days earlier in Angra dos Reis, striking teachers seized the torch and used it to run their own brief protest relay.\n\nIn Nova Igua\u00e7u, the delays left the crowds waiting long after the the torch was scheduled to arrive. They were briefly entertained by a local wag who earned ironic cheers as he ran past with a \u201cpoor people\u2019s torch\u201d made from a stick of wood and some rags.\n\nTwo middle-aged men were dressed up as superheroes: Batman and The Flash. Batman carried what he called \u201cA Torch of Shame\u201d with painted blood dripping down the side.\n\n\u201cThe billions spent on the Olympics are not for the benefit of Cariocas [Rio residents]. We need health and education,\u201d he said. Like many of those present, he had participated in the huge protests ahead of the 2014 World Cup and was echoing many of the same complaints. \u201cThere has been no progress since then,\u201d he lamented.\n\nBy midnight, the number of demonstators \u2013 and those who had come to cheer the torch \u2013 had dwindled by more than half.\n\nThen, after a five-hour delay, came the announcement that the relay had been diverted on security grounds: the torch would not arrive after all.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Brazil,\u201d lamented J\u00falio Cesar de Santos, who had arrived with a national flag draped around his shoulders. \u201cWe are not ready for this.\u201d\n\nThe torch\u2019s chaotic arrival in Rio encapsulates all the reasons why the XXXI Olympiad could go down as one of the least-loved in the 120-year history of the modern Games.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brazilians wait for the torch arrival in Rio\u2019s North Zone. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nRio 2016, critics say, has come to fruition against a backdrop of mixed public emotions and a dire economic and political landscape; its organisation has been plagued by delays and security concerns, and ultimately it will provide little benefit to poor communities.\n\nRather than excitement, Laerte Coutinho, a cartoonist who participated in the torch relay last week, feels what she describes as a \u201cpainful link between the Olympics and the Brazil of today\u201d. Although the sport will bring benefits for the young, she says that it best serves as an opportunity to reflect on social issues. particularly inequality. \u201cThe Olympics should not mask these problems. We need to keep our eyes open,\u201d she says.\n\nMarianne Eduardo, who runs a tourist company that has benefited from the influx of Olympic visitors, said she welcomed the development and international attention that the event has brought to the west zone of the city, but she said the mood is more muted than it was before the World Cup in 2014.\n\n\n\n\u201cI see my friends divided: the ones that are more politically engaged aren\u2019t excited about the Olympics because it magics up a whole apparatus \u2013 ambulances, police, and construction works \u2013 that should always be in place. But other friends are excited. After all, when will there be another Olympics here in Rio? We have to make the most of it.\u201d\n\nEnthusiasm may be more evident nearer the venues. On Thursday, the torch will pass along the coast near the main Olympic Park in Barra da Tijuca, which has been lavishly unpgraded with new stadiums, hotels, roads and a rapid bus system. In the evening it will reach the tourist resorts of Ipanema and Copacabana, where a giant beach volleyball stadium has been erected on the sands. Closer to the city centre, the iconic Lapa arches have been whitewashed, a giant athletics-themed art installation has been erected above an apartment block in Flamengo and the once-dingy port area has been transformed into a cultural hub with futuristic new museums, up-market restaurants and live music.\n\nThis might normally be considered cause for celebration, but the timing could hardly be worse.\n\nThe Guardian view on the Rio Olympics: exalted ideals meet a grubbier reality | Editorial Read more\n\nThe Games take place in a country wrestling with a profound political crisis, a sprawling corruption investigation, an outbreak of Zika virus and the worst economic downturn in decades. But there was no way of predicting any of that when Rio was awarded the Olympics in 2009.\n\nFollowing\u2019s Beijing spectacularly impressive Games the previous year, it seemed logical that emerging economies \u2013 which seemed to have avoided the worst of the global financial crisis \u2013 would play a greater role in world affairs, taking up the international mega-events that had previously been held mostly in rich nations.\n\n\n\nWhen the decision was announced, the then president Luiz In\u00e1\u00e7io Lula da Silva \u2013 then one of the most popular statesmen in the world \u2013 hugged Pel\u00e9 \u2013 arguably the greatest footballer of all time \u2013 in celebration.\n\nIt seemed Brazil\u2019s time had finally come.\n\nNow, however, the Olympics are in danger of being remembered as the low point in a miserable collapse of political stability, economic strength and national confidence.\n\nNeither Lula nor his successor Rousseff will be at the opening ceremony because their Workers\u2019 party was forced out of power in May by the vote to suspend Rousseff. Rousseff\u2019s impeachment trial \u2013 confirmed at Senate committee stage on Thursday \u2013 will drag on until a week or two after the Games.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brazil\u2019s interim president, Michel Temer, second right, opens Rio\u2019s new metro line: two years late, 100% over budget and 10km short.

Rousseff and Lula\u2019s supporters plan more than a dozen protests on Friday to oppose the presence at the ceremony of the interim president, Michel Temer, who ousted his former running mate.\n\nAs well as chants outside the Maracan\u00e3, there are likely to be boos inside. Temer\u2019s latest approval rating is just 14%. The Olympics fare better, but are still supported by just 40% of the population.\n\nAlmost a fifth of tickets remain unsold. This tepid interest is partly because Brazil is far more obsessed with football than any other sport.\n\nCommunities across the country staged street parties for the World Cup, but it is hard to find any that are doing the same in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI guess we will show the ceremony, but we don\u2019t have any special plans for the Olympics,\u201d said the manager of a bar on Rua Benjamin Constant that organised mass public viewing for Brazil\u2019s matches in 2014.\n\nA bigger factor is the miserable economy, which is deep in recession and on course to shrink by almost 10% since the World Cup.\n\nThis is likely to be evident in the low-budget opening ceremony directed by Fernando Meirelles who will have to rely less on special effects and more on a strong message about climate change, favela life and the tried and trusted rhythms of carnival drummers.\n\nThe film-maker, best known for City of God, has said it would be wrong to lavish money on the ceremony when funds are scarce for schools and hospitals.\n\nThe budget, he says, will be a tenth of the London Games \u2013 which was in turn far below that of Beijing\u2019s.\n\nThe comparison with China is painfully unflattering in economic terms. Beijing\u2019s \u201ccoming out party\u201d in 2008 was a national project pushed through by a one-party state at a time of spectacular growth: the country\u2019s economy had grown by 250% in per capita dollar terms over the previous five years. Ahead of the Games, China built a new airport, three new subway lines, dozens of new stadiums and revamped close to a third of the city \u2013 mostly on time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A samba dance group perform on the street while waiting for the arrival of the Olympic torch in Rio de Janeiro. Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nBrazil, meanwhile, has seen its per capita income fall by 35% over the past five years and has struggled to align the priorities of the federal, state and city governments, not least because political turmoil has meant three changes of sports minister in half a year.\n\nCorruption, inefficiency and delays have plagued construction projects across the country. Although the stadiums have been built on time and to budget by the city and its private sector partners, the state government has made a total mess of the metro extension.\n\nThe new subway \u2013 all six stations of it \u2013 opened on Monday more than two years late, 10km short of the Olympic park and almost 100% over budget. Auditors said this week that more than a quarter of the 8.4bn reais ($2.6bn) cost may have been illegally inflated.\n\nOn top of these, are the usual Olympic problems of heavy traffic, the requisitioning of public spaces for hospitality houses and an overbearing security presence. The government has drafted in 22,000 troops, as well as drones, aircraft and warships, to bolster the police.\n\n\u2018The only Olympic legacy I see is repression and war\u2019 \u2013 a year in Rio\u2019s favelas Read more\n\nFears of terrorism \u2013 usually absent in Brazil \u2013 have made the authorities jumpy, prompting more than 20 bomb scares in the past two weeks. Of more real concern is the flood of military police into favela communities, where residents complain the Games have brought more shoot-outs and tension.\n\n\n\nThe threat of Zika, meanwhile, seems to have faded as new studies show the disease will be far less of a risk at the Games than initially feared.\n\nAt this week\u2019s meeting of the International Olympic Committee, the Rio 2016 organisers came in for heavy criticism. In an op-ed response to this and other complaints, Carlos Nuzman, the president of the organising committee, admitted the problems Brazil now faces were hard to imagine when it won the bid in 2009.\n\n\u201cIf asked then to describe the worst-case scenario for the country in terms of political and economic crises combined with a global health scare, you would arrive at today\u2019s scenario,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut he countered that test events had proved successful, transport systems had been improved, hotel accommodation expanded and the city would be left with a legacy of top-quality sports infrastructure.\n\n\u201cIt appears to have become an Olympic sport in recent years for media to take a pessimistic tone and place a microscopic lens on host cities\u2019 problems prior to sporting mega events,\u201d he notes.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that the Games can be the antidote to the doom and gloom. The Games can lift the national mood, unite the population behind the outstanding exploits of the athletes and show the very best of Brazil.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protester dressed as Batman awaits the torch relay on Copacabana Beach boulevard.

Brazil\u2019s 2014 World Cup was plagued by far greater delays and budget overruns during the buildup, yet the tournament itself was widely considered a success.\n\nThe best of Rio is very different from the best of London or Beijing. It does not have the wealth of a first world nation. Nor does it have the powers of an authoritarian state to censor inconvenient facts, quash dissent and ram through construction projects (even the maximum estimate of 66,000 relocations for this Olympics is dwarfed by the million-plus people who were moved in Beijing ahead of 2008).\n\nBut it will provide a far more beautiful setting than its predecessors, a greater propensity to party and a knack of muddling through that has been honed over the many previous crises faced by this developing democracy.\n\nOver the next two weeks, we will find out whether this is enough to make the 2016 Games memorable for all the right reasons.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeffae2ae0b742c65b78ffdd8456a464f080f140/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=68dcd043acc92f67d146d9d246ba3188", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6cef7e3495b526e988ffc98b56a769e9d521023/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2e51ed436dc72a2c100077715a8ede80", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+2016%2CSport%2CBrazil%2CWorld+news%2CAmericas", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dafca2838d44b073ccac2eeeb6f48c88285b6c1/0_118_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6683d356881af78354889fe29cde71e2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeffae2ae0b742c65b78ffdd8456a464f080f140/0_0_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c15a2824b34822143f9eab8661f7d7c2", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ff02f28c91ac1487be073693138b6d51c8bcba7/0_137_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dfaee77866b4290045e7b493bed4310d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/955026e7f368db61959fcfc3448e8b365d8671e1/0_133_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=943ce9c1417c2aefae3d8127118b08df"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeffae2ae0b742c65b78ffdd8456a464f080f140/0_0_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c15a2824b34822143f9eab8661f7d7c2", "date": "04/08/2016"}, "rank_61": {"title": "Who will rescue the Olympic ethos? | Sonia Sodha", "text": "This time four years ago, I\u2019d just completed a dramatic conversion from Olympics sceptic to enthusiast. I was one of those annoying people who grumbled incessantly in the run-up to 2012 about what a waste of money it all was. But once it all started, like thousands of other Londoners, I happily accepted the error of my ways.\n\nWomen\u2019s water polo, wheelchair basketball, climbing the Orbit: I enthusiastically snapped up tickets for anything that was available and spent far too much in the 2012 shop on tacky gear that now lies unworn at the back of my wardrobe. The only thing that marred my Olympics fever was the envy I felt seeing the Gamesmakers in their orange-and-purple kit. If only I\u2019d had the foresight to know it was going to be great and applied to volunteer.\n\nAs Rio kicks off and 2012 fades into the distance, my feelings about the Olympics have become more mixed. There is something amazing about a competitive celebration of sport that brings together athletes from countries and cultures that don\u2019t always see eye to eye, to compete on the same terms. The Olympics are a reminder that every game is beautiful in its own way: it doesn\u2019t take megabucks-earning footballers to provide nail-baiting, adrenaline-fuelled entertainment. Then there\u2019s the national pride \u2013 hosting the Olympics encourages people to celebrate their culture and identity, whether by swaying to the Girl From Ipanema or cheering as the Queen \u201cparachutes\u201d into the Olympic stadium.\n\nBut the Olympics have a darker side: the vast expense that host countries, rich or poor, are expected to cough up. Brazil is spending almost $10bn on hosting the Olympics on top of the $15bn it spent on the football World Cup two years ago. Yet it is a country racked by economic inequality, while having to cope with financial, political and health crises. Rio\u2019s public-sector workers have been paid weeks late, while hospitals say they\u2019ve run out of basic supplies. Is this really $25bn well spent?\n\nThe timelag is partly to blame: the International Olympics Committee (IOC) picks host cities seven years in advance. In 2009, booming Brazil would have seemed like a great bet for South America\u2019s first Games.\n\nBut boom or not, cost is a universal problem. One Oxford study that looked at every Olympic Games hosted since 1960 found the vast majority were blighted by overspend. The Sochi Winter Games have been the most expensive yet, costing an eyewatering $51bn.\n\nProponents point to the economic benefits of hosting the games. But try telling that to Greece in the wake of Athens 2004. Too often, the promised long-term benefits, used as PR to win round sceptical publics, prove elusive.\n\nThe IOC should favour bids that plan to deliver the Games within the bounds of commercial sponsorship\n\nCities have become increasingly sceptical. After several cities pulled out of bidding for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the IOC was left with just two \u2013 Beijing and Almaty, in Kazakhstan, both from countries marred by terrible human rights records. In the end, they plumped for Beijing, which won\u2019t even boast real snow. The bidding for the 2024 summer Games has also had high-profile dropouts. It feels as if \u201ccostlier\u201d should be tacked on the end of the Olympics motto \u201cfaster, higher, stronger\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the vast expense involved. The Sochi Games were put on at great cost to human rights; similar concerns have been flagged with respect to Rio. Cheating is nothing new, but revelations that Russian security agents were actually involved in surreptitiously swapping athletes\u2019 urine samples suggest it has reached new depths. And the IOC has never properly put to bed its issues with corruption.\n\nIt is hard not to feel that international sport has lost its way. But there has been the odd exception: Los Angeles put on one of the most modest-ever Olympics in 1984, using pre-existing venues. It even made a profit.\n\nWithout reforms more fundamental than the timid ones already offered by the IOC, the future of the Olympics looks grim. The job of hosting will increasingly be left to wealthy states with dodgy human-rights records, led by dictators happy to throw vast sums at vanity projects in order to draw the eyes of the world\u2019s media. A far cry from the original spirit in which the Olympics were conceived.\n\nThe excesses involved undermine, rather than boost, the Olympic legacy. Four years on from 2012, when you can buy a Gamesmaker shirt for a fiver on eBay, you have to wonder whether it would have made much difference if we had spent half the amount. Had we been allowed by the IOC, we could have used existing venues across the country and boosted parts of the country even more in need of investment than east London. Some of the cash saved could have been spent on school sports budgets that have been slashed since 2012, much needed given that the proportion of privately educated athletes in Team GB has risen from 20% to 28% since 2012.\n\nThis will be the first Olympics in which people can cheer on the Refugee Olympic Team, which surely represents the very best of the Olympic spirit. But imagine if some of the billions saved from hosting a cheaper Olympics were spent on international aid to conflict-stricken countries and their low- and middle-income neighbours that host the vast majority of refugees, putting Europe to shame?\n\nTo encourage a more cut-price Olympics will require radical reform from the IOC. It should favour bids that plan to deliver the Games within the bounds of commercial sponsorship, as Los Angeles in 1984. And it should encourage countries \u2013 even whole regions \u2013 to put on the Olympics, rather than single cities. That might even allow Africa to host its first Olympics, making it a genuinely global endeavour.\n\nTo an Olympics fan like me, these reforms seem the definition of no-brainer. But I suspect the reason they haven\u2019t yet materialised might have something to do with the fact that they would involve IOC officials making do not just with a less glamorous Olympics, but also a less glamorous set of perks.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4f9d94aa6d74346bd10bed1588bf147c44191c2/0_0_2500_1500/2500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=62cb9955313cd198438169aa4ec38739", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+2016%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CBrazil%2CUK+news%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news%2CRio+de+Janeiro%2CCorruption+index+and+barometer", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2f4dffd85a6d4a50881f741f5b049b640434f2/0_136_3468_2081/3468.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=74e1dc635fd47fd3207ce5bb61533679", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fbe84f8a6421e1ea1f3ab77722b6a1b7664f0d0/0_260_5412_3247/5412.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c24e10514ab5b25a6681be8aa989a181", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba6e24e6ea4f95d43c0b840404e8df43b3515938/0_48_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f274e88d5ec6357f74a8ed5065455d67", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2f4dffd85a6d4a50881f741f5b049b640434f2/0_136_3468_2081/master/3468.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=02965d214357150f094b19d0e49a1ce6", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Sonia_Sodha,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=045793b916f0ff6e7228468ca6aa61c5"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2f4dffd85a6d4a50881f741f5b049b640434f2/0_136_3468_2081/3468.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=74e1dc635fd47fd3207ce5bb61533679", "date": "06/08/2016"}, "rank_20": {"title": "Rio's waste pickers: 'People spat at us but now we're at the Olympics' #Rio2016", "text": "Rio authorities partner with Coca-Cola to fund the Rio Olympics waste pickers programme, putting a spotlight on one of Brazil\u2019s most marginalised professions\n\nRio's waste pickers: 'People spat at us but now we're at the Olympics'\n\nRio's waste pickers: 'People spat at us but now we're at the Olympics'\n\nClaudete Da Costa started working as a waste picker with her mother when she was 11 years old, collecting recyclable goods in Rio de Janeiro to sell to scrap merchants.\n\n\u201cWe were ashamed,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople saw us and spat at us, thought we were thieves.\u201d\n\nToday, 36-year-old Da Costa\u2019s outlook has changed.

In addition, each waste picker will be paid a fixed daily salary of R$80 (\u00a319) by the Olympic Committee.

However, she adds that as the pickers have been hired under a professional contract, they will not receive their wages if they do not fulfil their obligations (for example, if they don\u2019t turn up to work), although she thinks this unlikely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in their interest to perform, they want this opportunity,\u201d says Braga. \u201cThey are very well prepared.

Photograph: Luiz Galerani\n\nThe Rio Olympics waste pickers programme is a partnership between Rio 2016, Coca-Cola, Rio state government and Brazil\u2019s federal government, which together have invested R$3m (\u00a3720,000) in the scheme. Rio\u2019s waste pickers, made famous by the movie Waste Land, are not an uncommon phenomenon. The vast majority of Brazilian cities lack formal recycling programmes and separation is largely done by waste pickers, who search bins and scour pavements for recyclable goods such as aluminium cans. And, since mass collection gives better prices per weight, waste pickers in co-operatives can earn more money.\n\n\u201cBrazil is only beginning to understand the advantages of recycling, of selective collection,\u201d says Haroldo Mendon\u00e7a, solidarity economy coordinator at the labour ministry. \u201cBut we can give an example to other countries to show how to combine environmental care with economic empowerment.\u201d\n\nRio de Janeiro authorities hope to capitalise on the Olympics recycling project by continuing to use the model for the city\u2019s annual events, such as the Rio Carnival and New Year\u2019s Eve on Copacabana beach.

Those hoping for a refreshing dip in the neighbouring lagoon, meanwhile, can think again: it has been declared too polluted to swim in.\n\nThe handball arena\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arena to school \u2026 the handball arena will be used to build four schools after the games. Photograph: Lopes, Santos & Ferreira Gomes / AndArchitects\n\nThe good-news architecture story of the games, the handball arena has been designed to be dismantled and transformed into a series of schools once the events are over. Created by local studio Lopes, Santos & Ferreira Gomes, with UK firm AndArchitects, sections of the 12,000-seat building will be used to form the basic structural elements for four state schools, each accommodating about 500 pupils.\n\nFrom the slatted wooden cladding to the concrete circulation cores and the steel frame, all will make their way into the new structures. A similar plan in London 2012 never quite happened. The inflatable pillows from the Coca-Cola Beatbox pavilion were intended to be recycled into a canopy for a local school, but the cost of dismantling the structure intact proved prohibitive, so the whole thing was scrapped.\n\nThe accommodation\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Just 240 of 3,604 apartments sold \u2026 the athletes\u2019 village. Photograph: Heusi Action Images\n\nThe flats have been designed \u201cat a level that only kings have previously had\u201d, according to developer Carlos Carvalho, the 92-year-old property tycoon behind the 31 tower blocks of the athletes\u2019 village. He must have been referring to those hard-up kings who lived in rundown palaces with flooded floors, broken elevators, mouldy walls and holes in the ceiling, judging by the conditions that teams of athletes have been greeted with in the past few weeks.\n\nThe near billion-dollar project, known as Ilha Pura, has been built by Carvalho Hosken and Brazil\u2019s biggest construction firm, Odebrecht, who planned to recoup their investment by selling the luxury flats for 1.5m reais (\u00a3361,000) each. The property market has since plunged by 20% and just 240 of the 3,604 apartments have been sold. Meanwhile, as the teams moved in, more than half the buildings had yet to pass the safety tests.\n\n\n\nThe mascots\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vinicius and Tom \u2026 Rio\u2019s cute couple.

Read more\n\nThose moving into the crumbling, leaky accommodation blocks might at least be cheered by the presence of the beaming yellow cat-cum-monkey, whose constant grin is guaranteed to wipe away those mouldy apartment blues. Developed by Birdo, a S\u00e3o Paulo-based animation company, the official Rio mascot apparently \u201cpossesses the agility of a cat, the balancing skills of a monkey and the grace of a bird\u201d.\n\nNamed Vinicius in honour of Brazilian poet and lyricist Vinicius de Moraes, who penned The Girl from Ipanema, this hybrid Pok\u00e9mon creature was \u201cborn out of the explosion of joy that followed the announcement that Rio would host the Olympic Games\u201d. He is never far from Tom, his trusty shrub-headed friend, with whom he shares a treehouse in the Tijuca forest, from where they can see the whole city and marvel at the tidal wave of public money being pumped into private real-estate speculation.\n\nThe torch\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rub and grow ... the telescopic Rio Olympic torch. Photograph: Rio 2016\n\n\u201cInspired by the warmth of the Brazilian people,\u201d the Rio torch features movable segments, allowing it to expand when you run your hands up and down its sculpted shaft. Oo-er. As it grows, each segment opens to reveal a coloured resin section beneath, in shades of blue and green designed to represent the sea, mountains and sky, while the roaring flame stands for the sun \u2013 a palette that\u2019s conveniently the same as the Brazilian flag. The wavy contours, meanwhile, were derived from the sinuous strokes of the Rio 2016 brand identity, itself inspired by Brazil\u2019s curvy assets: mountains, waves and bodies on the beach.\n\nThe outfits\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Renaissance varsity\u2019 \u2026 Stella McCartney designed the Team GB collection.

Confirming that the 90s are well and truly back, her outfits favour bold graphic prints that employ a redrawn British coat of arms. Three lions hold flaming Olympic batons, while the national flowers of leek, rose, flax and thistle appear in the centre shield and a crown composed of medals sits up top, \u201csymbolising continuity, teamwork and shared responsibility\u201d.\n\nThe collection has been hailed by Vogue as sporting a \u201c\u2018renaissance varsity\u2019 edge that wouldn\u2019t have looked amiss on a Gucci catwalk\u201d. And you can dress up like your idols, too, because it\u2019s all for sale: Jessica Ennis\u2019s pants can be yours for \u00a325.\n\nThe cauldron\n\nThe work of American kinetic sculptor Anthony Howe, this year\u2019s cauldron design is certainly on message with Rio\u2019s anti-global warming theme, featuring the smallest flame of any recent Olympics \u2013 magnified several hundred-fold by a gigantic rotating reflector. Featuring lots of little mirrored spheres and discs that rotate behind the flame in a spiralling sunburst wheel, it could be a glittering headdress plucked straight from the Rio carnival.\n\n\u201cMy vision was to replicate the sun,\u201d says Howe, \u201cusing movement to mimic its pulsing energy and reflection of light.\u201d Removed from the stadium following the opening ceremony and installed in the city centre, the 12 metre wide lampshade doesn\u2019t appear to have quite the same magic now that it\u2019s stationary.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1b45994cf915b5bc10d2e8eb79cf3dd65e6cff0/30_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30fb9168ee6b24394411e860425c2e7b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c08a62cd36d36110f333db44f427c01b9583293/0_61_1568_941/1568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a14f8af5512d7ee1b76986659624ff38", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Architecture%2CDesign%2CArt+and+design%2CFashion%2CCulture%2CRio+2016%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CBrazil%2CAmericas%2CCities", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d6c64209c377ee0eed428deddb1499a9aec708/0_298_4900_2939/master/4900.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f33953b2b0a653729d4e44d6c941c39a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c08a62cd36d36110f333db44f427c01b9583293/0_85_1568_941/master/1568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e41005bbe9f421bc37e51a68c934ceda", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Oliver-Wainwright,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1aa270c46b716e34c4783ced3376cc9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39b9970c10153133b1f3ebb883b3aa669092cea9/0_225_6161_3696/master/6161.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54cb22cb5709a2f0229dfae08c8ac05f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77f6ac1da898e32222b363657028d35e183edda8/0_90_1568_941/master/1568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=75d5a31eb35d4aa2d34915e1898193c7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ef0afe77aaf038cbaa7e2a4dde6b6ccd36a6c3d/127_693_4746_2848/master/4746.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d48835017f4a6fb4801d3f61b69b55c"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c08a62cd36d36110f333db44f427c01b9583293/0_61_1568_941/1568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a14f8af5512d7ee1b76986659624ff38", "date": "09/08/2016"}, "rank_60": {"title": "Nigerian women forced into prostitution in Italy, and the unsanitary side of Rio", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoverty matters\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigerian women trafficked to Italy for sex, and the Olympic legacy for Rio's favelas\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuge numbers of Nigerian women arriving in Italy are forced into prostitution.

Annie Kelly and Lorenzo Tondo reveal the unprecedented numbers of women being preyed on by trafficking networks. Abused and vulnerable, these women have a champion in Princess Okokon, who was herself trafficked from Nigeria in 1999, and has since helped hundreds of women to escape from forced prostitution in Italy \u2013 our video shows her working with women in Asti and Sicily. Spanish photographer Quintina Valero shares stories and portraits of women helped by Okokon\u2019s NGO to escape the sex trade. \nAs the Olympic Games began in Rio, three young journalists from the favelas \u2013 Daiene Mendes, Tha\u00eds Cavalcante and Michel Silva, look back on life in their communities over the last 12 months \u2013 a time of repression and increased violence. In our video, Mendes says she is now used to the constant sound of gunfire. \u201cWe ask for peace, but all we receive is war.\u201d And amid complaints of pollution and sanitation problems in Guanabara Bay, John Vidal looks at why the city is finding it so hard to clear up its waste, as it grapples with industrialisation, population growth and lack of money.\nHuge numbers of Nigerian women arriving in Italy are forced into prostitution.

Britain are the first country to win five consecutive Olympic titles in the men\u2019s four, breaking the record managed by East Germany between 1968 and 1980, and by Britain themselves between 1908 and 1932.\n\n\u201cWe just nailed that,\u201d said Gregory, who sits in bow and knows something about it \u2013 he was in the four who won in 2012. Nash called it \u201can epic, epic row\u201d. For Louloudis \u2013 who, as a four-times Boat Race winner, can appreciate a fierce rivalry \u2013 there was an \u201cextra sense of satisfaction\u201d in seeing off an Australian team who are their good friends and close rivals.\n\nThe race had been dubbed an Ashes on the water after Australia qualified for the final with quicker times, without ever meeting them head to head. Britain had the better getaway but Australia, alongside in lane four, pursued them furiously. After 500m, the Australians were 0.83sec behind; by halfway they had brought the gap down to 0.22, the numbers on the front of the two boats fluttering in tandem.\n\n\u201cWe knew we had to go off hard to counter the Australians in the first 1,000m,\u201d said Sbihi, a 6ft 6in gentle giant who is the team\u2019s engine, \u201cand they kept challenging, kept challenging, kept challenging, but we kept answering.\u201d Britain\u2019s semi\u2011final strategy \u2013 they had purposefully slowed once they were well in front, so no one would know what more they had to give \u2013 began to look like a smart one.\n\nSbihi was the only man allowed to keep his eyes on the rival boat as it came alongside. Louloudis \u2013 the stroke who has a degree in classics and a grandfather who was a viscount \u2013 said he had taken inspiration from Michael Phelps\u2019s concentration in the pool. \u201cYou want to be that guy who\u2019s just totally focused in,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but notice when another crew is there but to have your best row you need to be totally focused on your internal processes. It\u2019s very tempting to look out but we did a very good job of being focused and working on the feedback Mo was giving us.\u201d\n\nThe British boat was packed with experience as well as muscle \u2013 four years ago Sbihi and Louloudis rowed together in the men\u2019s eight, winning bronze medals, while Nash had a bronze from the men\u2019s pair. And of course there was Gregory, maintaining the 16-year tradition that the men\u2019s four always contain one member of the previous Olympic-winning boat.\n\nStill, the 32-year-old did not necessarily see it as an advantage. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was happening four years go,\u201d he said when asked to compare the two rows. \u201cThis one I knew what was coming and sitting on that start line, oh, it\u2019s horrible \u2013 those hours in the morning are tortuous.\u201d\n\nDuring the race he was far less nervous. \u201cI had this sense of confidence, this sense that we were just waiting to move. That\u2019s the thing you build up over a year of racing together \u2013 this sense of knowledge and belief in each other and knowing what they can do. So I was just sitting there enjoying it.\u201d\n\nEnjoyment is not a word much used in a sport in which training and races typically leave the athletes breathless with agony. And for Britain\u2019s 70-year-old coach J\u00fcrgen Grobler, who can now lay claim to more Olympic gold medals than several island nations, this will be further vindication of the infamous hell-camps he puts his athletes through (Gregory has acknowledged that vomiting is now just part of his day job).\n\nThe German allowed himself a smile as his athletes met him on the pontoon, but he wasn\u2019t ready to indulge in any history talk. \u201cYou don\u2019t count the ones in the past,\u201d he said, in typically dour fashion. \u201cYou always look to the next one.\u201d\n\nThe men\u2019s gold had arrived within a quarter-hour of Heather Stanning and Helen Glover\u2019s victory in the women\u2019s pair, and the sun had finally begun to emerge after a morning of pouring rain and mixed emotions at Lagoa.\n\nPaul and Gary Donovan, brothers from Skibbereen, had taken Ireland\u2019s first ever rowing medal in the lightweight men\u2019s double sculls, holding off a fierce challenge from Norway and South Africa to take a heroic silver. The Donovan brothers have been full of quick wit this week, and here was no different. Asked to comment on their historic act, younger brother Paul said: \u201cI suppose it\u2019s hard to know what it means,\u201d Paul said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s never been done by anyone before.\u201d\n\nBut it was a grim day for the Northern Irishman Alan Campbell, who has represented Great Britain in four consecutive Olympic Games. He failed to qualify for the final of the men\u2019s single sculls, falling off the pace go finish fourth in his semi-final, despite being in second place at halfway.\n\nAs for the men\u2019s four, they had to postpone their celebrations until they discovered whether they were needed as spares for the next day\u2019s races. Once they were given the all-clear, Nash said he planned \u201ca few caipirinhas followed by a few beers and probably some pretty rowdy celebrations\u201d, adding: \u201cFollowed by another day of that, and another day of that. That\u2019s my game plan.\u201d\n\nRio Olympics 2016: Glover and Stanning win gold, Ennis-Hill begins heptathlon \u2013 live!

And just as the success of homegrown cyclists in London 2012 inspired the country to get out on their bikes, Rio 2016 seems to be encouraging people to seek out their local swimming pools.\n\nThe Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) said this weekend that it has seen a massive jump in the number of people searching online for their nearest leisure pool during the first few days of the Games, as Adam Peaty picked up Britain\u2019s first gold medal, in the 100m breaststroke, and Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor and Jazz Carlin each took silver.\n\nBritish divers Chris Mears and Jack Laugher, and Dan Goodfellow with Tom Daley, also made the medals podium in the synchronised events, while the US swimming phenomenon that is 31-year-old Michael Phelps has astonished and inspired by striking gold again at his fifth Olympic Games.\n\n'He's our hero': Adam Peaty's swimming club celebrates his success Read more\n\nAlison Clowes, the ASA\u2019s head of media, said it had seen 80,000 people use their \u201cpoolfinder\u201d app over the period 5-11 August \u2013 almost double the rate for the same period in July \u2013 and they were getting dozens of phone inquiries too. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a boost from our Olympic successes, which is great,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2014, more than 2.6 million adults took part in a weekly swimming session in England and Wales, and half of all British schoolchildren regularly visit a pool, making it our highest participation sport, more popular than football or rugby.\n\nNevertheless, Clowes said, there is still work to be done if the success stories from Brazil are to leave a lasting legacy. Many smaller, older pools are being closed and local authority budget cuts are affecting spending levels for important facilities such as swimming pools.\n\nMeanwhile, the average level of swimming proficiency among schoolchildren requires improvement.\n\n\u201cSwimming is now on the national curriculum for Key Stage One and Two, which is good. But our research shows that 52% of children are still leaving school unable to swim 25 metres unaided, so that\u2019s a concern that we still need to be tackling.\n\n\u201cIn general, although a lot of the older pools are coming to the end of their lives and being closed, many of the newer ones actually are bigger, with different uses. So, they\u2019ll have a learning pool, a lanes pool, that kind of thing,\u201d said Clowes.\n\n\u201cIn terms of water space, that\u2019s gone up. Birmingham, for example, has closed pools but their actual water space has increased.\u201d\n\nBut swimming clubs and lane swimmers do regularly complain about the lack of large pools.\n\nThe great thing about swimming is that you don't have to be an Olympian to do it. It doesn't matter what age or ability Nick Chaplin, of the ASA\n\nIn Derby, 19 miles from new world record holder Adam Peaty\u2019s home town of Uttoxeter, the city council has closed two pools, one permanently and one temporarily, blaming central government cuts to its budget. Peaty\u2019s own swimming club, City of Derby, still struggles to get its members enough hours in the water.\n\nAnother Olympic swimmer, Ross Davenport, has criticised the state of \u201cpool space\u201d in Derby, saying club members had to travel into the next county for training.\n\nHowever, ASA director of participation, Nick Caplin, said overall the picture was a positive one. \u201cThe success of our Team GB swimmers in Rio is brilliant and is clearly inspiring people watching at home,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about swimming is that you don\u2019t have to be an Olympian to do it. It doesn\u2019t matter what age you are or your ability, once you are in the water you can have fun playing games, swimming lengths or just relaxing.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was corrected on 19 August 2016.

So how has funding in British sport changed in the run-up to Super Sunday?\n\nUK Sport, which determines how public funds raised via the national lottery and tax are allocated to elite-level sport, has pledged almost \u00a3350m to Olympic and Paralympic sports between 2013 and 2017, up 11% on the run-up to London 2012.\n\nThose sports that have fuelled the rise in Britain\u2019s medal-table positions over the past eight years \u2013 athletics, boxing and cycling, for example \u2013 were rewarded with increased investment. \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal regime, but it\u2019s as crude as it is effective,\u201d said Dr Borja Garcia, a senior lecturer in sports management and policy at Loughborough University.\n\nSports that failed to hit their 2012 medal target \u2013 including crowd-pleasers such as wrestling, table tennis and volleyball \u2013 either had their funding reduced or cut altogether. Has that affected their prospects in Rio? It may be too soon to tell, but so far swimming is the only sport that has won medals at this Olympics after having it funding cut post-2012.\n\nThe aim is quite simple: to ensure Great Britain becomes the first home nation to deliver more medals at the following away Games. As it stands after day nine on Sunday, Team GB has one more medal than at the equivalent stage in London \u2013 their most successful ever Games.\n\n\n\nSwimming\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Peaty competes in the men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay final on day eight of Rio 2016. Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images\n\nSpearheaded by the gold medal-winning Adam Peaty, Team GB has already secured its biggest Olympic medal haul in the pool since 1984, but it was one of the elite sports to have its funding slashed from \u00a325.1m to \u00a320.8m after a disappointing London 2012, when its three medals missed the target of between five and seven.\n\nWith six medals so far in Rio \u2013 one gold and five silvers \u2013 it has already passed its target of five for this Olympic Games. Its national governing body, British Swimming, will hope to be rewarded for this success with an increase in funding before Tokyo 2020.\n\nUK Sport funding for medal-winning Olympians is assured, but some of the clubs where they spend long hours training are struggling to survive. Peaty\u2019s City of Derby swimming club was almost forced to close last year when two pools in the city shut down for nearly three months, its chairman, Peter Spink, said.\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t got the focus of the council back on to swimming, things would have got a lot worse for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWorst case, closure could have happened. I don\u2019t think I felt we got that close fortunately but unless we did something drastic and worked our way through it then, if not closed, we would have been a very much diminished club.\u201d\n\nSteve Layton, the club\u2019s secretary, credited the local authority for fixing a roof at one pool and reopening another that had previously been closed, but added that it was only a matter of time before one of the \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d facilities was permanently closed down.\n\nThe club is trying to raise sponsorship money through partnerships with local companies, he said, but has so far been unable to raise enough money to pay for coaches rather than rely on volunteers. The ultimate aim is to raise enough investment for an Olympic-standard 50m pool in Derby, so that the Adam Peatys of tomorrow are not confined to the city\u2019s 25m pools.\n\n\u201cSwimming is not like football. It doesn\u2019t draw the crowds and we are in times of austerity. We understand all that, but we are trying to get sponsorship to give us some support,\u201d Layton said.\n\nThe grand rhetoric of an Olympic legacy after London 2012 did not add up to much for cities such as Derby, but Spink said he was hopeful now of more investment in swimming following Team GB\u2019s success in Rio. \u201cThe legacy of the London Olympics was always a big thing. We saw that a little bit, but of late that has dwindled a bit. The issues we have in Derby demonstrate that there really wasn\u2019t the appetite either in local or national government to fund sport in that way,\u201d he said.\n\nCycling\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bradley Wiggins, Owain Doull, Edward Clancy and Steven Burke compete in the men\u2019s team pursuit finals. Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlong with a knighthood for Bradley Wiggins, an increase in funding followed Team GB\u2019s cycling success in London 2012. Their final tally of 12 medals exceeded the target of between six and 10, resulting in a boost to British Cycling\u2019s coffers from \u00a326m to \u00a330.2m.\n\nIn Rio, Team GB has secured six medals \u2013 four gold and two silver \u2013 and smashed two world records, with both the women\u2019s and men\u2019s team pursuit taking gold. It is well on the way to reaching its final Rio target of between eight and 10 medals.\n\nGymnastics\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Max Whitlock competes in the men\u2019s pommel horse final. Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMax Whitlock\u2019s heroics in the Olympics arena on Super Sunday ended a 116-year wait for a British gymnastics Olympic champion.\n\nHis double gold also boosted Team GB\u2019s medal count in the sport to four, with Louis Smith winning silver in the pommel horse and Bryony Page becoming the first British woman to win an Olympic trampoline medal by claiming silver in Rio.\n\nHaving previously lost all of its elite-level funding, British gymnastics has experienced a steady increase in public investment over the past 20 years, from \u00a35.9m at Sydney 2000 to \u00a314.6m in the current cycle, after it benefited from a 36% funding increase after beating its medal target in London 2012.\n\nFunding for individual athletes\n\nIn addition to the funding given to each sport\u2019s governing body, some elite stars \u2013 described by UK Sport as \u201cpodium-level athletes \u2013 also qualify for individual funding to help with living costs.\n\nMedallists at the Olympic Games, senior world championships and Paralympics gold medallists can receive up to \u00a328,000 a year in athlete performance awards funded by the national lottery.\n\nSportsmen and women who finish in the top eight in the Olympics can receive up to \u00a321,500 a year. Future stars, those expected to win medals on the world or Olympic stage within four years, can get up to \u00a315,000 a year.\n\nHas it worked?\n\nMost experts agree that UK Sports \u201cno compromise\u201d funding approach has underpinned Great Britain\u2019s rise from 36th in the medal table in Atlanta in 1996 to third at London 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very rational, cold approach. Medals have gone up. British elite sport is certainly booming. The returns of medals per pound is there,\u201d said Garcia.\n\nSome critics, however, say UK Sport\u2019s approach has gone too far and is damaging grassroots sport. They have argued that focusing disproportionately on sports such as cycling, sailing and rowing has meant those such as basketball risk withering because they were unable to demonstrate they would win a medal at either of the next two Olympics.\n\n\u201cWe can ask all the philosophical questions, which are valid. What about basketball, which has a lot of social potential in the inner cities? What about volleyball? What about fencing? Why focus on specific sports?\u201d said Garcia.\n\n\u201cParticipation is going down. Why do we invest all this money in all those medals? Just to get the medals? To get people active? To make Great Britain\u2019s name known around the world? With a cold analysis of the objectives and the money invested, yes it has worked.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have some sympathy for UK Sport as an organisation. They were given the objectives and they delivered.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn May, Sport England, which focuses on grassroots sport, unveiled a four-year strategy to target inactivity. More than a quarter of the population is officially defined as inactive because they do less than 30 minutes of activity a week, including walking.\n\nThe move is a lurch away from the earlier strategy, which was set before London 2012 and focused on getting more people to play more sport with only mixed results.\n\nSevere cuts to local authority budgets are also squeezing resources at the grassroots level. Councils across England have been forced to make cuts since 2010, when grant funding for local authorities was cut by a fifth, more than twice the level of cuts to the rest of the UK public sector\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jazz Carlin celebrates winning silver in the women\u2019s 800m freestyle final.

ASA research shows that 52% of children leave school unable to swim 25 metres unaided.\n\nJennie Price, the chief executive of Sport England, said: \u201cWatching our athletes achieving great things in Rio is truly inspirational, particularly for young people.

So how has funding in British sport changed in the run-up to Super Sunday?\n\nUK Sport, which determines how public funds raised via the national lottery and tax are allocated to elite-level sport, has pledged almost \u00a3350m to Olympic and Paralympic sports between 2013 and 2017, up 11% on the run-up to London 2012.\n\nThose sports that have fuelled the rise in Britain\u2019s medal-table positions over the past eight years \u2013 athletics, boxing and cycling, for example \u2013 were rewarded with increased investment. \u201cIt\u2019s a brutal regime, but it\u2019s as crude as it is effective,\u201d said Dr Borja Garcia, a senior lecturer in sports management and policy at Loughborough University.\n\nSports that failed to hit their 2012 medal target \u2013 including crowd-pleasers such as wrestling, table tennis and volleyball \u2013 either had their funding reduced or cut altogether. Has that affected their prospects in Rio? It may be too soon to tell, but so far swimming is the only sport that has won medals at this Olympics after having it funding cut post-2012.\n\nThe aim is quite simple: to ensure Great Britain becomes the first home nation to deliver more medals at the following away Games. As it stands after day nine on Sunday, Team GB has one more medal than at the equivalent stage in London \u2013 their most successful ever Games.\n\n\n\nSwimming\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Peaty competes in the men\u2019s 4x100m medley relay final on day eight of Rio 2016. Photograph: Adam Pretty/Getty Images\n\nSpearheaded by the gold medal-winning Adam Peaty, Team GB has already secured its biggest Olympic medal haul in the pool since 1984, but it was one of the elite sports to have its funding slashed from \u00a325.1m to \u00a320.8m after a disappointing London 2012, when its three medals missed the target of between five and seven.\n\nWith six medals so far in Rio \u2013 one gold and five silvers \u2013 it has already passed its target of five for this Olympic Games. Its national governing body, British Swimming, will hope to be rewarded for this success with an increase in funding before Tokyo 2020.\n\nUK Sport funding for medal-winning Olympians is assured, but some of the clubs where they spend long hours training are struggling to survive. Peaty\u2019s City of Derby swimming club was almost forced to close last year when two pools in the city shut down for nearly three months, its chairman, Peter Spink, said.\n\n\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t got the focus of the council back on to swimming, things would have got a lot worse for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWorst case, closure could have happened. I don\u2019t think I felt we got that close fortunately but unless we did something drastic and worked our way through it then, if not closed, we would have been a very much diminished club.\u201d\n\nSteve Layton, the club\u2019s secretary, credited the local authority for fixing a roof at one pool and reopening another that had previously been closed, but added that it was only a matter of time before one of the \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d facilities was permanently closed down.\n\nThe club is trying to raise sponsorship money through partnerships with local companies, he said, but has so far been unable to raise enough money to pay for coaches rather than rely on volunteers. The ultimate aim is to raise enough investment for an Olympic-standard 50m pool in Derby, so that the Adam Peatys of tomorrow are not confined to the city\u2019s 25m pools.\n\n\u201cSwimming is not like football. It doesn\u2019t draw the crowds and we are in times of austerity. We understand all that, but we are trying to get sponsorship to give us some support,\u201d Layton said.\n\nThe grand rhetoric of an Olympic legacy after London 2012 did not add up to much for cities such as Derby, but Spink said he was hopeful now of more investment in swimming following Team GB\u2019s success in Rio. \u201cThe legacy of the London Olympics was always a big thing. We saw that a little bit, but of late that has dwindled a bit. The issues we have in Derby demonstrate that there really wasn\u2019t the appetite either in local or national government to fund sport in that way,\u201d he said.\n\nCycling\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bradley Wiggins, Owain Doull, Edward Clancy and Steven Burke compete in the men\u2019s team pursuit finals. Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlong with a knighthood for Bradley Wiggins, an increase in funding followed Team GB\u2019s cycling success in London 2012. Their final tally of 12 medals exceeded the target of between six and 10, resulting in a boost to British Cycling\u2019s coffers from \u00a326m to \u00a330.2m.\n\nIn Rio, Team GB has secured six medals \u2013 four gold and two silver \u2013 and smashed two world records, with both the women\u2019s and men\u2019s team pursuit taking gold. It is well on the way to reaching its final Rio target of between eight and 10 medals.\n\nGymnastics\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Max Whitlock competes in the men\u2019s pommel horse final. Photograph: Toshifumi Kitamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMax Whitlock\u2019s heroics in the Olympics arena on Super Sunday ended a 116-year wait for a British gymnastics Olympic champion.\n\nHis double gold also boosted Team GB\u2019s medal count in the sport to four, with Louis Smith winning silver in the pommel horse and Bryony Page becoming the first British woman to win an Olympic trampoline medal by claiming silver in Rio.\n\nHaving previously lost all of its elite-level funding, British gymnastics has experienced a steady increase in public investment over the past 20 years, from \u00a35.9m at Sydney 2000 to \u00a314.6m in the current cycle, after it benefited from a 36% funding increase after beating its medal target in London 2012.\n\nFunding for individual athletes\n\nIn addition to the funding given to each sport\u2019s governing body, some elite stars \u2013 described by UK Sport as \u201cpodium-level athletes \u2013 also qualify for individual funding to help with living costs.\n\nMedallists at the Olympic Games, senior world championships and Paralympics gold medallists can receive up to \u00a328,000 a year in athlete performance awards funded by the national lottery.\n\nSportsmen and women who finish in the top eight in the Olympics can receive up to \u00a321,500 a year. Future stars, those expected to win medals on the world or Olympic stage within four years, can get up to \u00a315,000 a year.\n\nHas it worked?\n\nMost experts agree that UK Sports \u201cno compromise\u201d funding approach has underpinned Great Britain\u2019s rise from 36th in the medal table in Atlanta in 1996 to third at London 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very rational, cold approach. Medals have gone up. British elite sport is certainly booming. The returns of medals per pound is there,\u201d said Garcia.\n\nSome critics, however, say UK Sport\u2019s approach has gone too far and is damaging grassroots sport. They have argued that focusing disproportionately on sports such as cycling, sailing and rowing has meant those such as basketball risk withering because they were unable to demonstrate they would win a medal at either of the next two Olympics.\n\n\u201cWe can ask all the philosophical questions, which are valid. What about basketball, which has a lot of social potential in the inner cities? What about volleyball? What about fencing? Why focus on specific sports?\u201d said Garcia.\n\n\u201cParticipation is going down. Why do we invest all this money in all those medals? Just to get the medals? To get people active? To make Great Britain\u2019s name known around the world? With a cold analysis of the objectives and the money invested, yes it has worked.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have some sympathy for UK Sport as an organisation. They were given the objectives and they delivered.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn May, Sport England, which focuses on grassroots sport, unveiled a four-year strategy to target inactivity. More than a quarter of the population is officially defined as inactive because they do less than 30 minutes of activity a week, including walking.\n\nThe move is a lurch away from the earlier strategy, which was set before London 2012 and focused on getting more people to play more sport with only mixed results.\n\nSevere cuts to local authority budgets are also squeezing resources at the grassroots level. Councils across England have been forced to make cuts since 2010, when grant funding for local authorities was cut by a fifth, more than twice the level of cuts to the rest of the UK public sector\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jazz Carlin celebrates winning silver in the women\u2019s 800m freestyle final.

ASA research shows that 52% of children leave school unable to swim 25 metres unaided.\n\nJennie Price, the chief executive of Sport England, said: \u201cWatching our athletes achieving great things in Rio is truly inspirational, particularly for young people.

In Rio, she failed to live up to her own expectations by failing to qualify for the 200m freestyle and the 200m back finals with her only gold being in the 200m freestyle relay, only because she swam in prelims. Didn\u2019t even get on the podium. LME\n\n\n\nThe biggest disappointment I had was not with any athletes but with that segment of \u201cfans\u201d who spent the Olympics hounding Gabby Douglas for entirely fabricated reasons. The Olympics are supposed to bring out the best in us, not the worst. HF\n\nStar of the Olympics\n\nSimone Biles had been preordained as individual all-around champion from the beginning of last year, casting one of the Olympics\u2019 prestige competitions as essentially a race for the silver. That she would come home with a fistful of golds, barring injury or an unimaginable meltdown, was the working presumption. But then Biles had to, you know, go out and do it. Her performance under that pressure is hard to fathom. Clearly it made an impact on her team-mates, who voted the smallest member of the 554-person delegation to be the flag-bearer at Sunday night\u2019s closing ceremony. BG\n\nUsain Bolt has now overwhelmed his opponents in the 100m and 200m for three Olympics now. And while he will never win as big as he did in 2008 he still wins comfortably enough that he can still turn his head and laugh. No athlete, not anyone in the NBA or any of the swimmers or gymnasts, draws a crowd or creates a buzz like Bolt. When he is running it remains THE show of the Games.

There was no shortage of predictions that these Games would be a disaster. Zika, fecal bacteria in the water, body parts washing up on the beach, crime, political corruption, unfinished venues, mosquitoes covered in fecal matter and body parts washing up on corrupted beaches while engaging in criminal construction. But the Rio Games went as well as any other. Whoops. DG\n\nI mean, come on. Isn\u2019t it obvious? The Olympics are built for one man and one man only: Usain Bolt. Three gold medals in three consecutive Games is jaw-dropping. When he runs, the Jamaican sprinter knows that the only person who stands in his way is himself. Anyone else is merely a spectator, ready to marvel at poetry in fast motion. LME\n\nGlobally? Probably Usain Bolt. US-specific? Simone Biles. She certainly had the biggest breakout in popularity over the course of the last few weeks, transforming from a name casual sports fans were vaguely familiar with into an undisputed superstar. HF\n\n\n\nBest villain\n\nRyan Lochte. By invoking the worst stereotypes of Rio criminality in a clumsy effort to conceal his knuckle-dragging antics, the 12-time Olympic medalist caused an international incident that overshadowed the achievements of countless athletes, many of whom only enjoy the spotlight once every four years. He is the living, breathing embodiment of privilege. BG\n\nRyan Lochte. Nobody loves an ugly American and Lochte became just that with his attack of the sign at the gas station and the insane story about the armed robbers who may or may have not been police. His story was so violent it left the city unsettled before it became outraged by his fiction.

A guy who makes mean faces while waiting to go to the blocks. If Phelps wasn\u2019t from America, America would hate Phelps. DG\n\nHope Solo. It all began with a thoughtless tweet, ridiculing a nation with Zika jibes. Then, it got much, much worse as booing and crowd-jeering became the norm every time she took a goal-kick during the tournament. Her Rio experience ended in a tasteless way as the greatest goalie the US has ever produced called Sweden \u2013 who beat them in the quarter-finals \u2013 a bunch of cowards. Stay classy, Hope. LME\n\nThanks to his rapidly disintegrating \u201crobbery story,\u201d I\u2019m going to go with Ryan Lochte for managing to use these Olympics as an opportunity to present himself as the Platonic Ideal of the 21st century Ugly American, trumping up half-baked lies based on lazy stereotypes to cover up his own jackassery. HF\n\nIs Phelps a better athlete than Bolt?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Usain Bolt brought joy and talent to the Games once again. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA\n\nHard to say. Phelps\u2019 otherworldly longevity \u2013 it\u2019s stunning to think he won his first medal when Creed was the biggest band in America \u2013 tips the scales in his favor. But when you consider the wider competition pool of a sport with virtually no barriers to entry, Bolt\u2019s ability to bring his very best when the lights are brightest stands alone. Consider that he\u2019s started in 21 finals in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay over the last eight years and won 20 of them \u2013 a false start in Daegu representing the lone blemish. Heady stuff. BG\n\nWow, this is a tough one, they are specialists at such different things. I\u2019m tempted to say Bolt because I bet he\u2019s a great swimmer but Phelps might be a fast runner too. We should have a separate Olympics for just the two of them, like the old Superstars on ABC. LC\n\nMichael Phelps is the greatest swimmer of all-time and it\u2019s not even close. But running is a universal human activity. Every child in every country learns to stand and then walk and then they try to run. It\u2019s natural. Swimming is learned, but every person on earth with a set of functioning legs has run. And Usain Bolt is the fastest runner in recorded human history. Bolt beats Phelps. DG\n\nLongevity against supremacy. Phelps \u2013 akin to a shark hunting for prey \u2013 has 23 gold medals. That\u2019s almost twice as much as any other Olympian. Bolt on the other hand is untouchable, holding the best ever records for 100, 200 and 4x100 meters. This is tough, but I\u2019m going with Phelps simply because he not only wins, he can do it in more than one race in the space of an hour. Not sure if Bolt could replicate. LME\n\nThis is a tricky, perhaps even unfair question. It\u2019s pretty much impossible to compare the two, who have both established themselves as the elite of the elite. Still, it feels like Bolt transcends his sport in a way that Phelps doesn\u2019t. Bolt looks like he\u2019s on a different plane of existence from those he competes against. HF\n\nThe US\u2019s performance at the Olympics was ...\n\nAs good as it gets. You know things are going OK when the Star-Spangled Banner supplants Mike Posner\u2019s I Took A Pill In Ibiza as the most overplayed song of the summer. Team USA finished on 121 medals. That total includes 61 won by American women, who would have finished fourth on the medal table if they comprised their own country. Yes, it\u2019s to be expected from such an affluent nation, but impressive all the same. BG\n\nSimply dominating. One afternoon I took a stroll near my apartment in Copacabana and heard the US national anthem coming from televisions in neighborhood bars three times as the US got golds in different events. LC\n\nDominant. The most gold, the most silver and the most bronze. The US finished with 50% more medals than runner-up China. When Donald Trump gets to work on making America great again, he can steer clear of the US Olympic program. They\u2019re doing just fine. DG\n\nThe best there ever was. Team USA passed the 100-medal mark on 18 August. But what\u2019s more impressive is the level of diversity across the squad. From humble, yet honorable boxer Nico Hernandez to the inspiring Ibtihaj Muhammad, this was a tournament where the colors of America truly shone. LME\n\n\n\nAbout what was to be expected? It feels like we\u2019re a bit spoiled here in America in the fact that no matter how many medals we come up with it there\u2019s only two possible results \u201cwe did what we expected to do\u201d or \u201cwe completely failed and should be embarrassed with ourselves.\u201d HF\n\nOne event that shouldn\u2019t be in the Olympics\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sorry dressage, your time in the sun is over.

Olympic competitions should in theory represent the biggest international event in that sport, a standard doubly true for new additions to an already bloated programme. But that clearly wasn\u2019t the case based on the small army of top-ranked golfers who played the Zika card for a guilt-free out. BG\n\nBoxing. I\u2019ve always loved Olympic boxing, think of all the great stars who first introduced themselves to the world from the Games.

Ballroom dancing has struggled to even get consideration as an Olympic exhibition sport, yet we\u2019re giving out medals for horse dancing? Sad! A common sense rule for approving Olympic sports is that humans should be allowed to compete in it before other animals are. We don\u2019t have thoroughbred racing in the Olympics over the 100m do we? No. Dump dressage. DG\n\nGolf. After a 112-year hiatus, the sport returned to Rio and it was overwhelmingly anti-climatic. It really felt like a side event rather than a triumphant spectacle that returned after a century of hibernation. LME\n\nDressage.

There are also some truly talented futsal players (Falcao, Ricardinho, Amandinha) that deserve the Olympic spotlight. LME\n\nI was all set to make a case for baseball and softball making a return to the Olympics and then I did a search and discovered that the IOC voted to bring back both of them for the Olympic games in 2020.

More than 4,200 athletes from 164 nations took part, an all-time record, and demand was such that extra tickets had to be distributed. Philip Craven, president of the International Paralympics Committee, declared the event \u201cthe greatest Paralympic Games ever\u201d.\n\nPart of this derived from the Olympic Games, which were themselves such a success. We had become accustomed the long, hot days of watching sport, and the Paralympics benefited. But for whatever reason, we all got behind disability in sport, and recognised that a man in a wheelchair or a swimmer lacking a full hand could be as heroic as any \u201cnormal\u201d competitor.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018In Rio, funding has been diverted, question marks hover over crucial travel grants and just 12% of tickets have been sold. There\u2019s a real danger of it being back to business as usual.\u2019 Photograph: Cameron Hart/AP\n\nNow, in Rio, there\u2019s a real danger of it being back to business as usual. Extra funding for the Olympics was diverted away from the Rio Paralympics. Olympic venues were closed and dismantled. Transport services were cut. Worst of all, a question mark has been thrown over grants enabling disabled athletes from 40 of the world\u2019s poorest countries to come to Rio. By mid August, only 12% of tickets had been sold. Craven says the Paralympics has not faced such circumstances in its 56-year history.\n\nIt\u2019s by no means all the fault of Brazil, whose government, badly strapped for cash, is doing its best to save the Paralympic Games. But it does show how incredibly difficult it can be to keep momentum going for disabled athletes, and disability issues generally.\n\nLet\u2019s move closer to home. There has been endless talk about the legacy of 2012 \u2013 have we really become fitter and sportier people as a result of watching all that sport? Has east London really benefited as well as it could have done from the Games? But what about the legacy of the London Paralympics?\n\nSince then we have had four hard years of austerity economics in this country, and no group has been as badly affected as disabled people: about half a million people have been hit.\n\nIn 2014, the Conservative welfare minister, Lord Freud, announced that some disabled people were not worth the minimum wage, and could be paid as little as \u00a32 an hour. The replacement of disability living allowance has caused mayhem for many of our most vulnerable people. Ministers backed down in March on the restrictions they had planned to personal independence payments (PIP), but there are a host of other reductions. The government\u2019s own figures ahead of the last budget suggested that cuts to disabled people would \u201csave\u201d taxpayers \u00a34.4bn.\n\nDisability hate crime: is 'benefit scrounger' abuse to blame? Read more\n\nHow? Well, among other things there is a \u00a340 cut coming next March for many new claimants of employment support allowance (ESA), around a third of the value of this crucial benefit. That equates to people not being able to cope, to having to rely on food banks, and occasionally to people killing themselves in despair. A third of those surveyed by the disability benefits consortium said they already had trouble feeding themselves, at the current ESA rate.\n\nIn a developed society, this can happen only where there is already an ingrained lack of compassion for those with disabilities. Disability campaigners are quite right that in one sense the Paralympic Games sets up a dangerous polarity between the \u201csuperhuman\u201d heroes on the one hand, and the \u201cfeckless, contemptible scroungers\u201d, as portrayed by the tabloids, on the other. Between sentimentality and venom, all that is missing is a clearsighted view of the vast majority of ordinary disabled people doing their decent best to get along, work, and live tolerable lives. But the binary heroes/scroungers, love \u2019em/loathe \u2019em mindset seems to be our woeful Paralympic legacy.\n\nAccording to data uncovered last year through the Freedom of Information Act, hate crimes against disabled people reported to the police during 2014-15 rose by 41%. The disability hate crimes network regards this as only the tip of a very nasty iceberg, and believes there are 60,000 such incidents a year.\n\nAll statistics should be regarded with caution but there is too much evidence on display of our shameful treatment of disabled people \u2013 from Treasury officials making \u201ceasy\u201d cuts, to newspapers slandering the unwell as scroungers \u2013 to be ignored. Frankly, that golden glow from the summer of 2012 has been betrayed, not just in Rio but every day on the streets of Britain. Meet the superhumans?

Four months after the Games ended, there are few signs of life.\n\nLeonardo Pasta, 40, an IT technician, and his family are Brazilian but live in Stoke-on-Trent, so their experience of the Games \u2013 like most people\u2019s \u2013 was confined to television. \u201cI thought they were really good,\u201d Pasta says, as he leads his children into a new bus rapid transit (BRT) line station. \u201cThere is always the question of corruption, but they left a good image.\u201d His wife, Danielle Santos, who works in retail, agrees. \u201cWith all the worry we had before, the result was more positive than we expected,\u201d she says.\n\nThe mood before the games was so gloomy that Brazilians generally had low expectations; for many in Rio, the post-Olympic scenario is even darker. In the months before the Olympics began, an enormous graft scam at the state-run oil company, Petrobras, brought hundreds of thousands on to the streets to call for the impeachment of Brazil\u2019s president, Dilma Rousseff. Although not directly accused, she was ousted for breaking budget laws a week after the Games ended.\n\nAfter the party: Rio wakes up to an Olympic hangover Read more\n\nThe state of Rio declared it was broke and was rescued with a R$2.9bn (\u00a3700m) government bailout. To add to that, there was the Zika epidemic, rising crime and Brazil\u2019s worst recession in decades. No wonder Brazilians were hoping things wouldn\u2019t deteriorate to the point that Rio would be shamed in front of the world.\n\nIn the end, the Olympics were a success \u2013 at least on television, and here in Barra de Tijuca, an upscale west Rio suburb of condominiums, malls and freeways, many saw them as a boon. Barra\u2019s Olympic hub benefited from a new metro line and BRT routes connecting it to the rest of the city. \u201cThe transport works really well,\u201d says Walfredo Heringer, 68, as security buzzes him into the gated condominium opposite the Olympic park, where he lives. \u201cIt improved the real-estate market.\u201d\n\nBut working-class Brazilians commuting from far-flung, lower-income areas to work in Barra say the Olympics brought them few tangible benefits. Vagner de Santana, 39, waiting for a bus outside the Olympic park, says the construction company he works for is so cash-strapped it hasn\u2019t paid his salary for two months, even though it worked on Olympic contracts. Brazil\u2019s chronic unemployment levels mean its workers are scared to quit, his colleague, Fabio Lobo, says. \u201cThat is why we have to accept it.\u201d\n\nThe Olympic legacy is also clouded by corruption allegations.

The companies involved are also embroiled in the Petrobras scandal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Police face protesters in Rio on 6 December.

De Souza is trying to introduce austerity measures that state employees, including firemen, police, teachers and prison guards, have angrily protested against.\n\nOn 6 December, these protests descended into violence when riot police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and percussion grenades at protesters threatening to invade the state assembly. Rio\u2019s city centre was turned into a riot zone as some protesters threw rocks and others burned barricades, vandalised an empty office block and torched a small digger.\n\n\u201cI have never seen anything like this,\u201d says David Sampaio, a police officer, who took part in the demonstration. Officers say the state\u2019s financial crisis has led to late salaries and shortages of everything from toilet paper to ammunition. Attacks on police bases installed in favelas \u2013 low-income, improvised communities \u2013 by armed drug gangs have increased. And with them, say some favela residents, so have police abuses.\n\n\u201cIt is total chaos. [There is] war between police and drug gangs,\u201d says Eduardo Lima, a PE teacher who lives in Fallet, a favela in central Rio. \u201cUnfortunately we are paying the price.\u201d\n\nFollowing the murder of an Italian tourist in a neighbouring favela, five people were killed in a police operation in Fallet on 9 November. Fallet is near the Marina da Gl\u00f3ria, where Olympic sailing races were held, and Santa Teresa, a district popular with tourists. But there are no resources for the sport classes Lima holds for children who idolise Brazilian gold medallists such as judoka Rafaela Silva and footballer Neymar. \u201cThey said they would leave a legacy.

They say that security, health and education are all precarious in the city, which has seen precious little Olympic benefit. \u201cJust this here,\u201d Silva says. \u201cThe rest is all shit.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7240de41eb1de4d6db824b3f530cc96544627603/0_245_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b4a4c298b9c57d4479b5bc01830d714", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e757b6e5c8974b3582800a9eef4facc13fdf9ac/0_321_4540_2723/master/4540.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3016c70f958f20d05f4d0daa59842c5c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/580f0c2c09b19873f8867950e29f0d1328f19aa6/0_95_3829_2298/master/3829.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c10d4b50aaa1ddd79b448b91765a925", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+de+Janeiro%2CRio+2016%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CWorld+news%2CBrazil%2CAmericas%2COlympic+legacy%2CGlobal+development", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e757b6e5c8974b3582800a9eef4facc13fdf9ac/0_321_4540_2723/master/4540.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e615128020795d090ee94247485b3afe", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e757b6e5c8974b3582800a9eef4facc13fdf9ac/0_321_4540_2723/master/4540.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3016c70f958f20d05f4d0daa59842c5c", "date": "20/12/2016"}, "rank_2": {"title": "Rio Olympic venues already falling into a state of disrepair", "text": "Just six months on from the 2016 Games, a number of Rio\u2019s major Olympic venues have fallen into a state of disrepair. Since the Paralympics closing ceremony, the Maracana Stadium has been looted, the key Games precinct has been shut down and the city\u2019s Olympic golf course is struggling.\n\nThe most alarming visual deterioration can be seen at the Maracana, where worms have damaged the now-threadbare playing surface, windows inside the stadium have been smashed, copper wire stolen from walls and ceilings, and a reported 10% of the 78,000 seats have been torn up. Late in January local electric utility company Light cut off power to the stadium in response to unpaid bills, claimed to be in the region of three million reals (USD$940,000).\n\nRio's Olympic venues, six months on \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nAt that point construction company Obrecht \u2013 part of the consortium managing the stadium \u2013 called for the state of Rio de Janeiro to take over the administration of the unloved venue. Earlier in January the Maracana had been looted, with thieves taking fire extinguishers, hoses, televisions and a bronze bust of Mario Filho, the journalist for whom the stadium was named.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A view from outside Maracana Stadium, which has been looted and damaged since the Rio 2016 Games.

The course superintendent, Neil Cleverly, says the company he works for, Progolf, hasn\u2019t been paid for two months by the Brazilian Golf Confederation. And the course architect, Gil Hanse, is not impressed.\n\n\u201cWe are bitterly disappointed ... we witnessed this type of brinkmanship during the construction of the course, and we are hopeful that this is another example of having to hit a low point before things get better,\u201d Hanse told Golf World.\n\nFour other venues at Olympic Park \u2013 two arenas, the tennis centre and the velodrome \u2013 have also failed to attract new operators following the conclusion of the Games, meaning the entire facility has been effectively closed down and remains off limits to the local community.\n\nLast used on 18 September during the Paralympics, Olympic Park had attracted 150,000 patrons per day during the Games. Management of the park has transferred from Rio\u2019s City Hall \u2013 who couldn\u2019t attract an appropriate bid for the facility during an attempted sell-off \u2013 to the the federal government.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rio\u2019s Olympic golf course is struggling to attract players.

Spectators were aghast at the wider state of disrepair in the park. \u201cIt\u2019s an abandonment, a disregard for public money for the visitors who come here and want to see it used,\u201d one spectator, Wanderson Wygers, told Rio newspaper O Globo.\n\n\u201cThe legacy is incredibly poor,\u201d said Theresa Williamson, executive director of Catalytic Communities \u2013 a Rio-based non-government organisation providing support to favela communities \u2013 in an interview with AAP. \u201cThis all coincided with the economic recession but in Rio, just like the boom here was more intense because of the Olympics, now the fall is more intense because of the Olympics. Everybody here is suffering right now, of all incomes and all stripes and colours.\u201d\n\nThe future of the Deodoro sports precinct, home to the second-largest concentration of Olympic venues, is also uncertain. The Olympic precinct in Rio\u2019s western zone was slated to be a park and recreation area following the Games. But City Hall has closed it, terminating the operating company\u2019s contract last December. Rio 2016, the organising committee of the Games, are holding another tender to select a company to manage Deodoro, hoping it will re-open around March.\n\nThe Olympic athletes\u2019 village remains open, but has proven an undesirable and prohibitively expensive housing option for local residents. The 800,000 square metre village \u2013 which the Australian Olympic Committee initially refused to move into at the beginning of the Games \u2013 was planned to be post-Olympic public housing, but few locals are buying into it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Abandoned prefabricated houses remain next to the Olympic golf course in Rio.

Everybody you talk to is struggling in some sense.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 10 February 2017.

The confetti falling over their heads served as a curtain, closing the Rio 2016 Olympics on a high note.\n\nBut the drums could not hush up the investigations into allegations of massive bribes related to the two sport events \u2013 the World Cup and the Olympics \u2013 that were to be used as a joint endeavour to present to the world a new image of Brazil: a modern country, sophisticated and, above all, responsible.\n\nBeyond the debate about the use of the stadiums, legacy and the projection of a young nation, it was the police that took centre stage as soon as athletes from all over the world left the country. Over the seven months that followed, politicians would be arrested and formally accused, while sports officials, judges and many of the venues would be the target of police operations.\n\nWhat is Rio\u2019s Olympic legacy? Read more\n\nWhat began as an investigation into the former state oil company Petrobras in 2014 soon also became a criminal process about the organisation of the two mega-events, paid for mostly with public funds and presented to citizens as a reason to be proud. The latest release of official documents by the Brazilian federal supreme court, seen by the Observer, shows that the venues were not only cathedrals of new world records but are alleged to have channelled millions of dollars worth of bribes. Brazil\u2019s supreme court opened investigations into around 100 politicians, based on hundreds of hours of testimonies by past and present executives at the construction and chemicals conglomerate Odebrecht. The documents released show that:\n\n\u25a0 Six out of the 12 stadiums built for the World Cup are now under investigation for irregularities and bribery.\n\n\u25a0 Eduardo Paes, the former mayor of Rio, is accused by a former executive at Odebrecht of having taken R$15m (\u00a33.7m), in exchange for facilitating contracts related to the Olympic Games.\n\n\u25a0 The new subway line in Rio, claimed as a key 2016 Olympic legacy, is the target of a police operation for suspicion of fraud.\n\n\u25a0 The president of the accountability tribunal of the state of Rio, Jonas Lopes, is being investigated for allegedly accepting bribes in exchange for the approval of the contracts for the Maracan\u00e3.\n\n\u25a0 Arena Corinthians, the new stadium in S\u00e3o Paulo that hosted the opening match of the 2014 World Cup, has been investigated for \u201cpossible criminal practices\u201d. Odebrecht executives claimed it was a \u201cgift\u201d to the country\u2019s former president Lula.\n\nThe suspicion reached the man who, for the IOC, was the key to the Rio Games and presented to the world as the face of a new generation of Brazilian politicians. According to the documents released by the supreme court of Brazil, Paes \u2013 Rio\u2019s mayor from 2009-16 \u2013 is accused of having taken his illicit share from the event. In a speech at Maracan\u00e3 in August, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, described Paes as \u201ca great leader\u201d.\n\nBlame it on the IOC: its profiteering Olympics has never looked more exploitative | Marina Hyde Read more\n\nThe allegations contained in the documents released by the supreme court are based on a plea bargain agreement reached with Benedicto Barbosa da Silva J\u00fanior, a former executive at Odebrecht. He has admitted to organising the payment of bribes, in exchange for public contracts.\n\nAccording to him, his \u201cbusiness group gave over R$15m to Eduardo Paes, in light of his interest in facilitating contracts related to the Olympic Games\u201d. A third of this money was sent to offshore accounts, including in Switzerland, Benedicto J\u00fanior alleged. The former mayor\u2019s press office denies any involvement in the affair and claims the allegations are \u201cabsurd\u201d.\n\nThe company behind the accusation ended up being awarded the contract to build the Olympic Village, the Olympic Park and the new subway line, among others. Ironically, the athletes\u2019 village was named \u201cPure Island\u201d by Odebrecht.\n\nThe subway line is, in fact, a target of a separate police operation. The suspicion of fraud was brought to light after the bill for it exploded from an original plan of R$880m to R$9.6bn.\n\nPaes\u2019s administration is not the only one in such a situation. S\u00e9rgio Cabral, a former governor of Rio and the main cheerleader for bringing the Olympics to Brazil, was arrested in November on corruption charges and is now in prison awaiting trial. Cabral denies any wrongdoing and his lawyers say they will only present his defence and his version of the facts during the trial.\n\nIt was during his mandate that the works for the renovation of Rio\u2019s iconic Maracan\u00e3 were commissioned. Along with Cabral, some of the members of his cabinet were also arrested. Today, the attorney general\u2019s office in Rio is demanding the return of R$200m from the money spent during Cabral\u2019s term in charge of the stadium, claiming fraud and overpricing.\n\nBrazil's corruption inquiry list names all the power players \u2013 except the president Read more\n\nIn only one of the items investigated \u2013 the installation of air conditioning \u2013 the total cost jumped 1,257% during the construction, to a total of R$18.5m. The allegations point to the suspicion that the bribes were not limited to politicians but also to those who were responsible for auditing the contracts.\n\nBased also on plea bargain agreements reached by Odebrecht executives, prosecutors and the police are investigating Lopes \u2013 who presided over the body responsible for checking that public contracts are in order \u2013 over corruption charges.\n\nLopes was accused of having asked for bribes in exchange for the approval of the contracts for the Maracan\u00e3. Cabral, who denies any wrongdoing, is alleged to have sent a member of staff and a judge to receive R$4m to approve the deal. Lopes also denies the allegations.\n\nEdson Fachin, a member of the supreme court, said in his accusation: \u201cBeyond the transfers of money to the former governor S\u00e9rgio Cabral, payments have been identified to the benefit of the agents related to the Accountability Tribunal of Rio.\u201d The final bill for the stadium was R$1bn, 75% above the initial price.\n\nBut the Maracan\u00e3 was not an isolated case. In the plea bargain agreements, a total of six stadiums built for the World Cup are cited by politicians or executives as being part of illegal deals and instruments to transfer bribes.\n\nCaught up in the affair is the fanatical Corinthians fan Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, known simply as Lula, who was president of Brazil from 2003-10 before being succeeded by his Workers party colleague Dilma Rousseff.\n\nRegarding the stadium used for the World Cup opener between the hosts and Croatia, the supreme court said it would investigate \u201cpossible criminal practices associated with the construction of the Corinthians Arena\u201d.\n\nVicente C\u00e2ndido, a congressman from Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party, is alleged to have received R$50,000 for his job of trying to find a way to allow public funds to pay for the stadium. C\u00e2ndido is also one of the directors of the CBF, the Brazilian football federation. He has not responded to the claims but the Workers\u2019 party has defended all its members cited in the documents in a statement in which it rejected the \u201cfrivolous\u201d allegations.\n\nThe congressman Andr\u00e9s S\u00e1nchez, a former president of Corinthians and the main operator of the stadium, is also under investigation. He is accused in the documents released by the supreme court of having received R$3m from the construction company. C\u00e2ndido and S\u00e1nchez deny the allegations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The opening ceremony for the 2014 World Cup at Arena de S\u00e3o Paulo.

Photograph: Friedemann Vogel/Fifa via Getty Images\n\nBut it was the chairman of Odebrecht, Em\u00edlio Odebrecht, who suggested before a federal judge that the entire stadium could possibly be considered as one big bribe. According to Odebrecht, the Corinthians Arena was a \u201cgift\u201d from the company to Lula. The company agreed to pay for part of the construction cost, in recognition for what the government had done for it throughout the years. Between 2003 and 2015, it saw its turnover go from R$17bn to R$132bn during the years when Lula and Rousseff were in power.\n\nLula\u2019s lawyers have criticised the publication of the content of the plea bargain submissions, arguing that it is part of a campaign to damage his reputation and deny all of the claims. \u201cHe has committed no crime,\u201d declared Lula\u2019s defence in a statement to the press. According to them, the accusations are \u201cfrivolous and lack any materiality\u201d. \u201cThere are only statements and suppositions \u2013 and no proof,\u201d they stated.\n\nIn his plea bargain agreement, Marcelo Odebrecht \u2013 the son of Em\u00edlio and the chief executive of the company \u2013 repeated a very similar version about the \u201cgift\u201d. \u201cThere was a request from Lula to my father: Help Corinthians to have its private stadium.\u201d\n\nIn some instances, companies claim that agreements were done even before the government opened its taps to fund the construction of the stadium, with public money. Cartel arrangements were supposedly established to split the contracts. In one of the plea bargain agreements, the Odebrecht executive Ricardo Roth told the judges how his company entered into an understanding with the rival group Andrade Gutierrez to make sure the latter would win the contract to build the stadium in Bras\u00edlia. It was the most expensive arena ever built in Brazil, with a final bill of R$1.4bn. Lawyers for Gutierrez reject the claims.\n\nThis was also said to be the modus operandi at Arena Castel\u00e3o in Fortaleza and in Manaus, where England lost to Italy in the tropical heat in June 2014. In the case of Recife, Jo\u00e3o Ferreira, a former Odebrecht executive, said in his plea bargain agreement that different companies reached a deal to \u201cfrustrate the competitive aspect of the procurement process\u201d.\n\nOn the sports side, some of the officials involved have already been taken to prison. In March, Brazil\u2019s federal police arrested the former president of the nation\u2019s swimming federation, Coaracy Nunes, on charges of diverting public funds from the ministry of sport that were supposed to be used to pay athletes.\n\nIn 2016, when he was formally charged, he rejected the claims and insisted that the investigation was a plot from the opposition to take him down from the presidency.\n\nContracts between the government and 14 different sports federations are also under review, while the president of the CBF, Marco Polo Del Nero, has been indicted in the US in connection with the scandal that brought Fifa to its knees. The Brazilian official denies any wrongdoing and refused to step down.\n\nThe statements of Odebrecht executives to judges and prosecutors also suggest the distribution of bribes related to the World Cup and the Rio Games followed neither an ideology nor favoured a political party. What seems to have mattered was the capacity of a specific politician to assure benefits to the company.\n\nThis appears to have been precisely the case of Eduardo Cunha, a former speaker of parliament, who was ousted as a result of corruption allegations and sentenced last month to 15 years in prison. He has appealed against the verdict.\n\nCunha would become, in 2016, the person who orchestrated the successful impeachment of Rousseff amid huge political turmoil in Brazil.\n\nAccording to statements by the Odebrecht director Benedicto J\u00fanior, Cunha approached him with a very specific demand: he wanted 1.5% of the total value of the works being done at Porto Maravilha, the revitalisation of a historical harbour in Rio presented by the organisers of the 2016 Games as one of the main legacies of the event.\n\nBenedicto J\u00fanior alleges that the company agreed to pay, with the understanding it would have the backing of one of the most influential politicians in the country to assure the smooth transfer of public money to Odebrecht to be able to complete that specific venue.\n\nBenedicto J\u00fanior claims Cunha received R$9.7m in 36 monthly payments between 2011 and 2014. Cunha\u2019s lawyers have told the Brazilian press that the statement is false and was not based on any evidence.\n\nWhile these bribes were supposedly being paid, the government of Rio was imposing the costs of the mega-events on its own society. To make sure there would be enough funds for infrastructure work connected to the Olympics, authorities decided to delay wage payment of active civil servants in early 2016, as well as to retirees and pensioners of the executive branch. Without any cash in hand to pay salaries for May in full, the state of Rio de Janeiro announced that in effect only 70% of the payroll would be paid on the 14th of that month, with a financial outlay of R$1.1bn. The delay in payment of wages that month affected a total of 393,000 civil servants in administration, hospitals and public schools.\n\nSeven weeks before the opening of the Games, the state of Rio declared a \u201cstate of calamity\u201d. The move assured that it received a sum of R$2.9bn from the federal government immediately for expenses brought about by the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and also for the payment of salaries. In addition, these funds would also be used to pay for security and for the completion of Linha 4 of the Rio de Janeiro underground, which would connect the upmarket neighbourhood of Barra da Tijuca to the Ipanema area. This was considered an essential project for the Games to go ahead and was also tainted by corruption.\n\nThree months after the Olympic circus had closed its tent and left the country, the state of Rio de Janeiro gave clear evidence that it was bankrupt. In November 2016, the state government came up with a proposal that showed the sheer extent of the crisis, as well as who would have to foot the bill. Pensions started to be taxed, social programmes were cut and salary increases were cancelled.\n\nOverall, the economy of Brazil entered its worst recession, with unemployment affecting 13 million people.\n\nAs politicians and businessmen are put in jail and the economy is ruined, a statement by the IOC\u2019s Bach at the closing ceremony in Rio still resonates in the country. According to him, having held the Games in such a difficult political climate was, in fact, a \u201cmiracle\u201d. Today, the police have only one question: \u201cA miracle for whom?\u201d\n\nJamil Chade is the author of Bribes, Politics and Football \u2013 the Inside Story of the World Cup in Brazil", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e577eb0ff152a4d4985d85ace5d33f5407f89db1/0_334_5568_3339/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4da8b83b5f8bafba0ad3c9f86de01f42", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86718204598b0e08158ec1f1c9adf86e4dfe1d3e/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20d8a39f111d9db02d987f7d6c33c6ed", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14f7d2423d2500b303ea10d2aa3610edd7f09f49/0_85_5106_3064/master/5106.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac380d1d151968999f29644dba9eb539", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f95b517a3661c3bccb57da88d9f81b9ab928c153/0_899_2844_1706/master/2844.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4890b7e1d8371efdc65eadf955dbfa25", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rio+2016%2CWorld+Cup+2014%2CWorld+Cup%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CFootball%2CBrazil%2CAmericas%2CWorld+news%2CRio+de+Janeiro", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0a5b19a14a748bd63a4dd490d4aeda7b9745f92/0_57_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a664e3867f2b9d53b85d6c5f26ca0b4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e577eb0ff152a4d4985d85ace5d33f5407f89db1/0_334_5568_3339/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69878d653bb2754a2cda8ac8e93889c3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c9cbdc16959fed7e6f52e2ddd8f8b88c1c0aad/0_240_4831_2900/master/4831.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1647623ca7ed9deec82ca6c566c9dd6c"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e577eb0ff152a4d4985d85ace5d33f5407f89db1/0_334_5568_3339/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4da8b83b5f8bafba0ad3c9f86de01f42", "date": "23/04/2017"}, "rank_178": {"title": "Guns, political turmoil and hummingbirds in the living room \u2013 my farewell to Latin America", "text": "Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took one look at the Guardian\u2019s correspondent and yelled out: \u2018Hey, Gringo!\u2019 But if he could never quite fit in, Jonathan Watts has come to love the continent he is now leaving after five years\n\nIt was the merest of glimpses, but no less thrilling for that. A dark, sleek body, roughly the size of a person, arched elegantly out of the Tapaj\u00f3s river as we approached the S\u00e3o Luis rapids deep in the Amazon. A fraction of a second later, it plunged back below the swirling waters, leaving me wondering if my imagination or the morning mist were playing tricks. But no, it was real. It had been close enough to the boat to be sure of that. But what was it?\n\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez took one look at Jonathan Watts (above) and yelled out: \u2018Hey, Gringo!\n\nPerhaps a pirarucu (AKA arapaima), the giant of the Amazon, which can grow up to 10ft in length. But the lack of scales suggested it was more likely to be a dolphin. There were two species in these waters: the pink boto and the darker tucuxi. I concluded it was the latter.\n\nThe thought filled me with both hope and dread. Eleven years earlier \u2013 during my previous post as China correspondent \u2013 I had joined an international team of scientists on an expedition along the Yangtze river looking for the baiji freshwater dolphin. It was too late. Not one could be found. The animal was declared functionally extinct \u2013 a victim of industrial pollution, river traffic, overfishing and hydroelectric dams. After 20m years of existence, it was an alarming indication of a dying river. Yet here in Brazil on the Tapaj\u00f3s, the freshwater dolphins \u2013 albeit of a different genus \u2013 could be found without searching. There was still time to save them. It felt like a second chance.\n\nOne of the reasons I moved from China to Brazil to become Latin America correspondent in 2012 was to look for a more sustainable development model. Back then, Brazil seemed to be doing a lot of things right. Its booming economy had just overtaken that of the UK; the popular leftwing government was reducing inequality; deforestation of the Amazon was slowing; Brazilian negotiators had played a positive role in climate and biodiversity negotiations; and my new home of Rio de Janeiro was about to host the 2012 Rio +20 Earth Summit, the 2014 World Cup final and the 2016 Olympic Games. Besides, I told my teenage daughters, who were doubtful about leaving Beijing, there would be less smog, more blue skies and a warm and friendly vibe. We were all in for a shock.\n\nChina: witnessing the birth of a superpower Read more\n\nAdjustment was tougher than I expected. The differences were so vast. On the plus side, I grinned just to walk along the street and take in the views of what is surely among the most beautiful cities on the planet. My daily jog around the Lagoa took in the sights of the Christ the Redeemer statue, forested hillsides, the Rocinha favela, the peaks of Pedra da Gavea, Pedra Bonita and Dois Irm\u00e3os. I also saw more species of trees, birds, insects and mammals on those 7.4km (4.6-mile) runs than I would see in a whole year in Beijing. Similarly, I heard more good live music in my first week in Rio than perhaps my entire nine years in China.\n\nAfter the communist states of east Asia, the openness and accessibility of democratic Latin American leaders was also a welcome shock. Having spent years in usually fruitless applications to interview ministers and heads of state in China and North Korea, I came to my new post in Brazil with a target list of three prominent politicians that I would like to meet during my first year \u2013 Dilma Rousseff, Marina Silva and Alfredo Sirkis. Within a week, I had seen all of them either in press conferences or for lunch. As I was later to learn, getting politicians in this part of the world to talk is often less of a problem than getting them to stop.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dilma Rousseff: one of the great leaders of South America, before she was toppled. Photograph: Brazil Photo Press/CON/LatinContent/Getty Images\n\nOther initial comparisons were less favourable. Cariocas (as residents of Rio call themselves) seemed far less focussed on education, culture, history, science and work than Beijingers. If they had spare time and money, many preferred to spend it on their body (tattoos, gyms or cosmetic surgery) so they could look good on the beach. And, contrary to the happy-go-lucky party-people image, they could be extremely conservative. One time, I was denied entry to a press conference I was supposed to be moderating because I failed to meet the dress code (although admittedly flower-patterned shorts and flip-flops weren\u2019t the ideal match for my dress shirt). They also voted repeatedly for several of the country\u2019s most rightwing politicians and some took to the streets calling for a return to the 1964-85 military dictatorship.\n\nIn those early days, however, I was mainly frustrated. Everything felt unambitious, slow and unreliable compared with China. Was it necessary to have three different types of plug socket? Why on earth did I have to keep providing my mother\u2019s birth name for the most routine applications? The grotesque bureaucracy was not my only grumble. The notorious inequality was quickly evident, as was the enduring social legacy of what had been the world\u2019s biggest slave-trading nation. Apart from music, cultural life seemed poor and the food was bland compared with Asia. Property rental was absurdly complicated and the apartments were horrendously overpriced due to the country\u2019s then super-strong currency (Brazil was infamous at the time for selling the world\u2019s most expensive iPhones). I spent much of the first year sleeping in a mouldy shed that leaked in tropical rainstorms, obliging me to have a bucket by the pillow to catch the drops.\n\nMore importantly, it became apparent that I had been sold an overhyped image of Brazil. Far from being a new model, the past five years have proved a case study in how not to run a country.\n\nThis has been a spectacularly tumultuous period, encompassing the impeachment of a president, the worst economic contraction in 100 years, the biggest corruption scandal in the country\u2019s history, millions taking to the streets in protest, an unimaginable 1-7 defeat in the World Cup, a pre-Olympic Zika epidemic and a resurgence of violent crime and environmental destruction. My Brazilian journalist friends are not sure whether to feel grateful for the abundance of work or horrified at the flood of miserable stories. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 40 years of news packed into the last four years,\u201d observed one. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal. We seem to be reporting on the collapse of the republic,\u201d lamented another. It is impossible not to feel sorry for the country.\n\nBrazil has slipped into reverse gear on just about every front. Since 2012, the economy has shrunk by 9% and unemployment has almost doubled. Last year, deforestation of the Amazon accelerated by 29% and violent killings in Rio de Janeiro increased by almost 30%. Not surprisingly, the public has never been more frustrated with the government. Five years ago, the then-president Dilma Rousseff enjoyed approval ratings of 64%. That had fallen to 10% when she was politically lynched by her former allies last year. Her successor, Michel Temer, is even more unpopular. The most recent poll could find only 2% of voters who thought he was doing a good job.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A country in turmoil: protesters during a nationwide general strike in Rio de Janeiro on 30 June. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nIn some ways, the story of Brazil from 2012 to 2017 has been the inverse of China from 2003 to 2012. In Asia\u2019s biggest country, I observed sometimes brutal stability and spectacular economic growth. In Latin America\u2019s, I have witnessed turmoil and contraction. I have certainly inhaled a lot more teargas, particularly since the mass protests ahead of the 2013 Confederations Cup, which were a turning point.\n\nRegionally, the broad political trend has been a weakening of populist, leftwing power. In the past five years, the two great figureheads of the Latin left \u2013 Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 have died. The Brazilian Workers party founder Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has been put on trial and his party usurped from office by centre-right parties that have proved at least as corrupt. In Argentina, the formerly Per\u00f3nist government of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner has been replaced by the more conservative Mauricio Macri. In Bolivia, Evo Morales lost a referendum that would have allowed him to stand again for re-election. Venezuela, meanwhile, plunges ever deeper into crisis under Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Mexico are all exceptions in different ways. Latin American politics are too heterogenous for perfect generalisations.\n\nA clearer pattern \u2013 and one perhaps that underlines the tumult both here and elsewhere in the world \u2013 is the increasing evidence of climate change across the region. Patagonian lakes are drying up and glaciers retreating; Rio\u2019s beaches have been battered by record storm surges; Chile\u2019s forests were devastated earlier this year by unprecedentedly high temperatures and wildfires; and then Lima was hit by freak floods. Perhaps the most alarming story, however, was S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 the biggest city in Latin America \u2013 suffering the most prolonged drought in its history. I recall a dystopian moment when I was told there was no coffee at a Starbucks on Avenida Paulista \u2013 the city\u2019s main thoroughfare \u2013 because the taps had run dry. \u201cWe only have beer or Coke,\u201d the cashier said.\n\nThe destruction of the rainforest is making matters worse in ways that are only slowly being understood. But it often appears to be a bigger story overseas than in the media of Brazil and other Amazonian nations. As well as being a major source of carbon emissions and a threat to biodiversity, the loss of foliage is also eroding the forest\u2019s role as a climate regulator. Recent studies have shown that the Amazon acts as a giant water pump, channelling moisture inland via aerial rivers and rainclouds that form over the forest more dramatically than over the sea. As trees are felled, this function is weakened, which leads to more severe droughts and more extreme weather events.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Xingu river near the area where the Belo Monte dam complex is under construction in the Amazon basin. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nYet, even as scientists grow more alarmed, politicians are becoming less willing to act. In response to demands from the agribusiness lobby (which has become more powerful due to demand from China), Rousseff relaxed the Forest Code, Brazil\u2019s main law against illegal logging and land clearance. The current administration of Michel Temer has slashed the environment ministry budget, diluted licensing regulations, and is moving to reduce the size of conservation parks and indigenous territories. In Brazil and elsewhere in the region, activists who stand up against the loggers, farmers, miners and dam builders run the risk of beatings and murder \u2013 as I saw on an unforgettable trip to L\u00e1brea. More often than not, those in the frontline are indigenous communities who are trying to protect their territory, such as the Juruna, the Ka\u2019apor and the Mundruku and the Kichwa and Shuar. These days, the tribes wear T-shirts, ride motorbikes and use laptops, but they still often suffer the same fate as their ancestors when the first European settlers arrived \u2013 either driven off their land or murdered for resisting. Most prominent among them in this period was Berta C\u00e1ceres, an indigenous rights and environment activist in Honduras who won the Goldman prize in 2015 for her campaigns against deforestation and hydropower dams. In an email exchange at the time, she told me environmental protection was a cause worth fighting for. \u201cWe must undertake the struggle in all parts of the world, wherever we may be, because we have no other spare or replacement planet. We have only this one, and we have to take action,\u201d she said. A year later she was assassinated by a gunman.\n\nThis is the world\u2019s most murderous continent. In Central America, violence is the main driver for perilous child migration to the US, though it remains to be seen how this might be affected by the wall on the Mexican border being planned by the new caudilho in the White House.\n\nReporting here has its risks, though local journalists are far more exposed than foreign correspondents. The only time I saw a gang member fire a gun up close was after a visit to a crack den in the town of Lins, when I asked him why he had chosen his weapon. On a street in broad daylight, he squeezed a dozen or so rounds into the air that made me instantly regret my question. A few weeks later, police pushed his gang out of Lins in a \u201cpacification\u201d operation. I imagine they are back now. Thanks to a series of scandals and cuts in the police budget, the sound of gunfire is sadly becoming common again in Rio. Recently, I went to sleep three nights in a row listening to protracted shootouts echoing across the valley.\n\nApart from that, there were few hairy moments. The only crimes I experienced were having my credit card cloned three times and being pickpocketed. I was generally more worried about flying over the Andes (which often comes with gut-wrenching turbulence), the interruption of a dinner in Maranh\u00e3o in north-eastern Brazil by an uninvited tarantula, and the possibility of diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya. Zika was added to the list in 2016. Although my head told me the risks were mainly only to pregnant women, I could not help but feel a little unease \u2013 as well as irony \u2013 at being bitten by a mosquito during a press conference in which the head of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chan, explained why the Zika epidemic had just been declared a global emergency. The concerns were genuine, though the imminent Olympics meant the risks were overhyped. When the Brazilian government subsequently launched its biggest ever military operation against the tiny insect, it felt a little like something out of a science-fiction film.\n\nIn this continent of magical realism, the weird and wonderful were never far away. Evangelicals in a heavy-metal church in the Mar\u00e9 favela described visits by an angel in the form of a head-banger who would dance among them, shirtless with long hair, army boots, black trousers and chains. In the Andean mountains, I witnessed what looked at first like something out of an ancient myth: a beast with wings and horns charging down a matador. It was, in fact, a cruel and dangerous sport that involved stitching the talons of an endangered condor into the hide of a traumatised bull for the entertainment of a chicha-sodden crowd at a Yawar festival bullfight. Then there was a mass in the countryside of Rio by rebel anti-Vatican priests who insisted the pope was not Catholic enough. They preferred Vladimir Putin.\n\nThere have also been inspiring, uplifting stories: the end of the world\u2019s oldest civil war in Colombia, the overcoming of cold war hostilities between Cuba and the United States and the subsequent visits to Havana by Pope Francis, Barack Obama and the Rolling Stones.\n\nBut when it comes to liberal, well-run countries, Uruguay led the way by legalising marijuana, ramping up renewable energy and boasting a former president, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who lived his anti-consumerist values by eschewing a palace home for his charmingly ramshackle farmhouse.\n\nDespite Brazil\u2019s many woes, there was cause for hope in the success of Brazil\u2019s bolsa familia poverty relief programme (though it is now threatened by austerity cuts), the courage and canninness of indigenous groups fighting against loggers, the idealism of activists and prosecutors fighting illegal deforestation and exposing timber laundering , and the courage and talent of community journalists who provided a diary of life in Rio\u2019s favelas ahead of the Olympics.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A vibrant culture: a dancer takes part in carnival. Photograph: PeopleImages/Getty Images\n\nI will miss this continent. It has been an immense privilege to visit stunningly beautiful places such as Patagonia, Alter do Ch\u00e3o, Machu Picchu, Yasuni and Havana, and I am grateful to collaborators and editors who have worked with me on stories ranging from guerrilla graffiti pedants in Quito and the world\u2019s greatest vinyl collector in S\u00e3o Paulo, to the source-to-sewer journey of a drop of water in Mexico City and a retracing of part of a journey taken by the Edwardian explorer Percy Fawcett.\n\nAlthough I could never claim to blend in (Ch\u00e1vez took one look at me and yelled out: \u201cHey, Gringo!\u201d), I now think of Latin America as home (particularly since I moved out of the shed and into a forest apartment). I still don\u2019t appreciate the three-plug electrical system or Brazil\u2019s bureaucracy, but I have come to love the geniality of the people, the vibrancy of the markets and much of the food \u2013 especially a\u00e7ai, caldo de cana, tapioca wraps and Amazonian fish.\n\nI leave at a difficult time. Troubles lie ahead for Rio, Brazil and the world. This is not just because of a poor Olympic legacy (though homelessness has surged alarmingly in the host city since the Games) or woeful national leadership (Temer is the first sitting president to be charged with corruption and eight of his cabinet are implicated in bribery scandals).\n\nIn China, I came to believe environmental crises underlie much of the economic and political tension in the world. In Latin America, I found reason to hope it is not too late to do something about that. For sure, the trends are bad. But there is much here worth fighting for. Latin America may not offer a model of sustainable development, but compared with Asia it is relatively unscarred in terms of overpopulation and pollution, and compared with the US and Europe, average consumption is modest and biodiversity is rich. River dolphins in the Amazon are only a part of that wealth. The value of this natural heritage is easier to feel than to measure\n\nI will leave Brazil healthier and happier than I arrived. As I write this, the sun is streaming through the papaya and mango trees from a gloriously clear blue sky. It is midwinter, but the temperature is a balmy 25C. This morning, I cycled through the forest up to the Vista Chinesa viewpoint. Marmosets were waiting in the garden for food when I returned a couple of hours later. A hummingbird just flew into the living room looking for the nectar water that I forgot to leave at its usual spot by the window. Before I go, maybe I\u2019ll catch a final glimpse of a toucan, a jacu or a porcupine. Perhaps the gang of capuchin will invade the kitchen in search of an egg or a banana. There will be at least one possum. Then \u2013 after 21 years on the road \u2013 it will be time to return to London, to a new job, to an office, to a flat, and to pigeons, sparrows and, who knows, perhaps a squirrel. I\u2019m curious whether my old home will feel like a foreign country.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c853f144f4a0458a99538374d024d970cfdb2756/0_73_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=05cdfa5621c85deda86c85a436ef0df4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5da1491b1e2f7a5c3660825dfd3ed76d2c3c599f/0_138_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d4211087b48587945df7e31c68212d8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08bc074661726ac757d65eb4072b7ffe7554c5c3/0_348_4648_2788/master/4648.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8d0680c3d640fcf6c568c454d7c53d44", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/050c5c4d76ba429886d17311574a4957deaeb3f9/0_302_5634_3380/master/5634.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acb206bf62b04440727d694082967eb4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61fa3c30e94c6ae149c0d9193ebca6be0dc19c21/45_26_322_402/master/322.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bb61ce3537b05048e18bac35cad63486", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2898badd14cb7eccb85169de1fbc39330b823984/502_45_2443_1466/master/2443.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8f9ec979d7803e39294e661299c08bef", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35eda8c679a0d3149adf9078cbeead9c46fcf3fa/0_140_3400_2041/master/3400.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f4b019999d2a60b5a3d1799f7c0843bc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9238dde49865f1f512a5c37fb42fb984bf1d7aa8/0_287_4475_2686/master/4475.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aa67704216ae04018cacae8da92ed3ec", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9edc04c611118b19bfd7705cca899342eed052eb/0_166_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d58d06d8a52f98590d9e91f914c8585", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9238dde49865f1f512a5c37fb42fb984bf1d7aa8/0_287_4475_2686/master/4475.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=886fbdee87d29cfac77fedfd0a4e65ec", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Americas%2CBrazil%2CWorld+news%2CPeru%2CEcuador%2CMexico%2CVenezuela", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3b4e18f5ab4c419d552ab1b854a8087cca6b04/0_117_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d21fe6d71e20fc555a7bda30aaeae27b"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9238dde49865f1f512a5c37fb42fb984bf1d7aa8/0_287_4475_2686/master/4475.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=886fbdee87d29cfac77fedfd0a4e65ec", "date": "09/07/2017"}}
