Work would be needed to prepare it for the Games, and there has been criticism about bad sight lines when it is set up for athletics.\n\nLondon and Madrid can both boast athletes' villages close to the key venues, whereas athletes would have to travel by bus to their events in Paris.\n\nLONDON (Odds to win: 7-2)\n\nStrengths:\n\nLondon is perceived as having momentum, and the quality of its bid file was praised by the IOC inspectors.\n\nThe city offers strong claims for an Olympic legacy as it plans to regenerate a large area of land in the east of the city and build new sporting facilities.\n\nLondon's bid team believe they have the best athletes' village, which will be right in the heart of their Olympic Park.\n\nManchester made a success of the Commonwealth Games in 2002.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nLondon will need to hammer home the message that it can deliver its venue and transport plans, and that the general public fully backs the bid.\n\nThe aborted campaign to host the 2005 World Athletics Championships - London pulled out after a row over the proposed site at Picketts Lock - dented its international sporting standing.\n\nThere has also been confusion over the rebuilding of Wembley Stadium.\n\nNEW YORK (Odds to win: 20-1)\n\nStrengths:\n\nNew York's unsurpassed profile and multicultural population are powerful selling points.\n\nAnd the prospect of regenerating the city after the 11 September terrorist attacks would give an NY Games added impetus.\n\nDirect US involvement inevitably makes the task of marketing the Games easier.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nNew York has failed to secure funding for its Olympic stadium, which could scupper the bid before the final vote.\n\nAnd its evaluation report identified other issues which could worry IOC members.\n\nVancouver's successful bid for the 2010 Winter Games was a big blow, as the IOC is less likely to back consecutive events in one continent.\n\nThe Atlanta Games in 1996 were much criticised, with former IOC chief Juan Antonio Samaranch significantly omitting his usual sign-off that they had been the \"best-ever Games\".\n\nOn a wider front, criticism of American foreign policy could count against New York.\n\nMADRID (Odds to win: 12-1)\n\nStrengths:\n\nMadrid received a solid evaluation report, with its transport system, plans for an environmentally friendly Games and record of promoting Paralympic sport praised.\n\nIt has 83% of venues in place or in the pipeline, and its public support rating of 91% is the highest of the five rivals.\n\nThe city's status as a major European capital and reputation as a centre of sporting passion will endear it to the IOC - and it has never hosted the Games.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe major factor counting against Madrid is Barcelona's hosting of the Games in 1992.\n\nIn Olympic terms, 20 years may be too short a period in which to award the event to the same country, although US cities Los Angeles and Atlanta hosted the Games in 1984 and 1996.\n\nThe IOC inspectors said Madrid would need to revise its athletes' village plans, and did not have enough hotel rooms close to its Olympic venues.\n\nMOSCOW (Odds to win: 66-1)\n\nStrengths:\n\nHaving hosted the Olympics in 1980, Russia believes it has the knowhow to stage the event and would just need to modernise its sports infrastructure.\n\nAll of the sports, including football and sailing, could be held within one city, fulfilling the IOC's wish that a modern Games should be compact.\n\nThe bid relies largely on existing venues, and has the backing of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nMoscow's slim hopes faded even further when it received the weakest evaluation report.\n\nInspectors said it had not supplied detailed information about its plans, and voiced concerns about the quality of hotels.\n\nGiven the strength of the rival bids, winning over IOC members will be an uphill struggle.", "images":

Olympic Games in 2012 has begun to ebb away. Now the real business of building the Olympic Park begins. The London bid promised a significant legacy for the capital and Mayor Ken Livingstone claims a good model for sustainability is Atlanta 1996.\n\n\n\nSo what kind of legacy was delivered in Atlanta, the \"capital\" of the southern states of America?\n\nAtlanta 1996 doesn\u2019t have the best of reputations. It was criticised for being too commercialised, there were problems with public transport links and during the Olympic celebrations a lone lunatic set off a bomb in Centennial Olympic Park which caused the deaths of two people.\n\nSo it\u2019s perhaps an unusual place for our own Mayor Ken Livingstone to be looking for Olympic inspiration. Sydney is the most celebrated spectacle of modern times and Barcelona certainly created a physical legacy in its Mediterranean makeover.\n\nWhat Atlanta does have in common with London is its ethnic diversity. The origins of that diversity may be rooted in slavery, but the historical division between haves and have nots is not dissimilar to the relationship between the East End and the rest of London.\n\nThe Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) for the 1996 Olympics was steered by the man who\u2019s become known as the \u201cFather\u201d of the Atlanta event, Billy Payne.\n\n\n\nThe official responsible for ensuring the Games delivered an equalities and diversity legacy was Shirley Franklin. Ten years on she\u2019s a well respected Democratic Mayor of Atlanta.\n\nWhilst bidding for the Games, Billy Payne travelled the globe with Andrew Young. Young was a former US ambassador to the United Nations and a key confidente of Martin Luther King. Payne believes it was the unity and comradeship that they displayed which encouraged the International Olympic Committee to take their long shot bid seriously. Likewise, in London the diversity element in the 2012 bid was a key part of impressing the voting members of the IOC in Singapore.\n\nSurprisingly for a city whose Games have an ambiguous reputation; Atlanta appears to the outsider to revel in its Olympic City status. In the heart of the City you\u2019d be hard pressed to travel a few blocks without being reminded of what happened here 10 years ago. The Olympic rings seem almost as ubiquitous as the flag of the state of Georgia.\n\nAlthough, unlike the plans at Stratford, the Olympic venues were not all in one location, they were in close proximity to Downtown Atlanta. The Olympic Stadium was reconstructed after the Olympic show moved on, to become the home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team.\n\nThe odd shaped stadium in 1996 took account of the need for a baseball triangle. Turner Fields, as it is now known, was constructed with this alternative use in mind. From it you can still see the stand where Muhammed Ali (an Olympian in 1960), shaking from Parkinson\u2019s, lit the Olympic flame.\n\nWhen I met Billy Payne at the aquatic centre, the venue for all the swimming and diving events in 1996, it became clear that the relationship between the building contractor and end-user at the early procurement phase was critical to creating a lasting legacy for Atlantans.\n\nThe swimming pool remains. It has a moveable floor and bulkheads to alter the shallowness or length of the pool. Georgia Tech University which took over the management of the site before the Games had even begun reconstructed the facility in its wake. They added an extra floor to the building to include an indoor track and several basketball courts. These now provide a permanent location for the local clubs, schools and college sporting calendars.\n\nIn fact on the day we were in town several hundred children were competing in a noisy under 9s competition in the Olympic pool. None of them were even born when Olympians were busy winning medals here.\n\nInterestingly the centre piece of Olympic development in the heart of the city came as a bit of an afterthought. In late 1993, Billy Payne suggested to ACOG that they should think about building an Olympic Centennial Park on a twenty one acre site in the heart of downtown.\n\nMost members thought that was a daft idea because downtown had a reputation for being the roughest part of town. Most people used to pass through with their car doors locked.\n\nOlympic fountain in Atlanta Payne and Shirley Franklin pushed the idea through mid-stream and now take much of the credit for the most lasting legacy of the Games for the City of Atlanta. Both freely admit that neither truly envisaged the enormous consequences for regeneration that decision had.\n\nThe Park just about gets away without being Olympic kitsch. The Olympic rings are everywhere and the French even paid for a centrepiece statue and memorial to Baron de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic movement in 1886.\n\n\n\nFew people can fail to be impressed with the sight of hundreds of children who now come to play in the water fountains that spout from five Olympic rings. In my experience it is rare in American cities to see such an ethnically harmonious sight in a public place. Carl Lewis, nine times Olympic champion, told me he\u2019s moved by it every time he visits.\n\nThere\u2019s also a real regeneration lesson arising out of Centennial Park. A J Robinson was an architect responsible for a lot of the previous development in downtown Atlanta before, as he put it, he became part of the do-gooder brigade as Chief Executive of Central Atlanta Progress.\n\nHe is now responsible for sustaining the regeneration downtown. He believes one of the hidden consequences of the Park is a genuine interest in people buying properties and locating businesses close to the centre of town. Mayor Franklin estimates a 10% shift in the urban population towards downtown since 1996. Although the rundown downtown was predominantly black, the new migrants are predominantly white and certainly well heeled.\n\nNot everyone is happy at this kind of gentrification but Robinson says that he foresees the Olympic legacy sustaining itself for at least another 15 years. He\u2019s clearly a congenital optimist, but there is plenty of evidence in Atlanta to back up his faith.\n\nMayor Franklin also came up with a fiscal arrangement which transfers 20% of the tax dollars generated by the regeneration of downtown into poorer districts like Vine City or English Avenue. These districts remain predominantly black but, according to Bob Jones who runs an economic development agency which services these two communities, these tax dollars are real.\n\nBob Jones (l) talks to Kurt Barling In the past three years his development agency has funded a $30m low cost housing development from these tax dollars and he believes this is a concrete example of how the Olympics created what he calls a legacy of opportunity.\n\nJones suggests that the Olympics of 1996 were an important moment in the Civil Rights education of Atlanta. The City was at the forefront of the political movement and now he ventures it\u2019s at the heart of an economic revival fostered by mutual respect between communities.\n\nCertainly talking to volunteers like Jack and Shannon Grosko who were amongst the 50,000 who helped run events like the Marathon in 1996, there is a sense that more widely Atlantans attribute the transformation of their city to the Olympics. Jack says the best way for London to create a lasting legacy after 2012 is to get as many Londoners involved throughout the process of preparing for and then delivering the Games.\n\nAtlanta was best known for Civil Rights and the Civil War (think Gone with the Wind) before the Olympics but a few days ago it opened a new wing in its history museum dedicated to the Olympic Games. It clearly put Atlanta on the International map but as the exhibition recognises it has also given Atlantans an excuse to think big.\n\nLast month Mayor Franklin put together a private and public sector bid to preserve the official archive of Martin Luther King in Atlanta. She says this proves the Olympics has given the city the courage of its historic convictions. The archive was about to be put under the hammer at Sotheby\u2019s and could have been broken up. Instead the City Great and the Good stepped in with a multi-million dollar offer.\n\nOffering London the benefit of their hindsight Payne and Franklin both advise the London organisers at LOCOG to remain flexible. The big lesson of Centennial Park is that a great idea may surface in 2009/10. They also point to the need to concentrate their efforts and not go promising all things to all men (and women).\n\nLast week the City of Atlanta hosted a massive outdoor party in Centennial Olympic Park to celebrate 10 years of Olympic legacy. Whilst internationally few people may recognise it, many Atlantans are quietly (and not so quietly) confident that they will still be reporting fresh legacies from the 1996 Olympics in another decade\u2019s time.\n\nPerhaps Atlanta is not such an unhelpful model for Ken Livingstone after all.", "images": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/6833cdf2b474098da5cc64eccaf5212774c8e567.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/f3fe6555d5b9ca52ac159cc6fabd592a7816864b.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/4ce2251c28db82aa892a105b718dba4d6a74c327.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/8a58ae88a1441a0e49bb4706650dad0d24817ae0.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2feb0671e0fbd569c71f43ace93e35a69bd4255c.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/f4bb663f63f61bb29b6af75cc6d55d43217af43e.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/296b5f49c7f378cd58c746771ed5d67bbb4bb960.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/ef42f127312f3d2b067a6b3ca13251e641cc21b7.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2f9b5511b7b3922a821232b004b639a0350123c2.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/5ea3e7590d674d9be4582cc6f6c8e86070157686.gif"], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/ef42f127312f3d2b067a6b3ca13251e641cc21b7.jpg", "date": "27/07/2006"}, "rank_89": {"title": "'Heroes' will be Olympic legacy", "text": "By Matt Slater\n\n\n\nSuccess stories like Kelly Holmes' can bring huge benefits for UK sport\n\nThe government's handling of the Games' finances has come in for criticism and it has been suggested that grass-roots sport will face the biggest squeeze.\n\nSportsAid's Tim Lawler, however, thinks 2012 offers a golden chance to create a legacy for sport in this country.\n\n\"If we can develop some heroes, there is your legacy right there,\" he said.\n\n\"Kids don't pick up a tennis racquet during Wimbledon because they think the administration is great or the courts at the end of their street are in good nick.

Nobody actually wanted it except Ken Livingston and Lord Cole. More jobs for the boys. We cannot look after our own population. What a mistake to think we can look after all those wishing to visit.\n\nSandra Fenton\n\nI cant bear anything about the Olympics. What I worry about most are all those people flying in and swarming into London, who is going to make sure that they all go home again? It makes me feel physically sick.\n\nSheryn\n\nI have two young children and I believe they will benefit greatly from the games, not least because they get to witness a piece of history but mostly to give them a springboard on which to get involved in sport if they so wish.\n\nI would like to see some kind of preferential treatment for Londoners in obtaining tickets for our families since we are the ones footing the bill.\n\nAlison, SW London\n\nI'm fed up with hearing negative and completely self interested views on the london Olympics.\n\nIn my view it will be a wonderful and positive experience for our city and the whole of Britain, and it makes me proud to be British.\n\nGina Barker\n\nThe biggest gripe I have with the whole Olympics, was during the voting process. I have no idea how much of tax payer's money was spent on advertising London for the venue, but I was bombarded with adverts asking me to text to vote for London as the venue. At no point were we given the opportunity to vote AGAINST London being the venue. I for one would like to have seen those figures.\n\nGary Stanton\n\nHow can London under this government expect to produce anything to compare with what China has planned. Just look at their stadium alone. All it will bring is embarrassment and higher bills. Give it to Paris.\n\nTom Pattison, Leytonstone.\n\nWhy are you wasting money commissioning polls asking loaded questions to denigrate our Olympics in 2012? As a public service broadcaster, it is not your job to ask questions to get the answers you want but to educate and inform...\n\nG Moledock\n\nI am certain that we as Londoners will not see any benefit for the Olympic games. Currently we pay First world taxes and receive Third world services. The only people that will benefit, already have their snouts in the Trough. This may sound very hard and cynical but, I cannot think of any area in public service where we receive value for money.\n\nTony Lord\n\nA total waste of money, it will be for only a limited few i.e. corporate facilities but not the general public and the rest of the country will be left picking up the bill for years to come. The money could be put to better use by providing sports facilities for everybody then in the years to come we might be able to produce the athletes and sports men and women to complete. Many countries who have already hosted the Olympics are still paying for the pleasure many years later - do we want to do this?\n\nSarah Monett\n\nKen said that the Olympics were to be self-funding. If so, when do we get the \u00a3300 to \u00a3600 per household back?\n\nWe would feel much more interested if each London Household got free tickets to pay back their contribution. I am voting for Boris just hoping to stop Ken get a free place at the opening ceremony.\n\nJohn, Harrow\n\nCities or countries which need to boost their tourism and popularity get most out of hosting the Olympics. England has enough popularity and everyone already wants to come here, so we will get nothing by hosting the 2012 Olympics except a massive multi-million pound loss for building facilities that will never be needed afterwards.\n\nMichael Winkler, North London\n\nIn response to the comments made in the news I do believe the Olympics will have a significant impact on the majority of Londoners but not in a good way.\n\nThe tube network will not be able to cope with the increase in the number of tourists to the capital and combined with the current congestion will leave many people, tourists and Londoners alike, annoyed and confused about why more was not done.\n\nNick\n\nLondoners would be better off if 2012 had gone to Paris. We could hop on the train to the event, have all the fun & games, and avoid the strain of financing the project.\n\nAlso, funds diverted to 2012 could have been used for other projects with greater benefits for all UK residents. And many of us who have paid higher council tax to finance 2012 may not live to see the event, or be able to afford a ticket when it happens.\n\nOldsteddy, London\n\nI am an Australian (from Sydney) living in London.\n\nWe had the exact same topics raised in the lead up to 2000 - how will transport hold up? What effects will this have on me and my business etc etc.\n\nThe Sydney Olympics was the best thing that could have happen to Sydney, tourism increased in the years afterwards, everything ran smoothly and it gave the public the opportunity to see world class athletes from around the globe. It was brilliant for local business and left us with stadiums and leisure centres that are iconic today, all open for the public to use.\n\nIt was worth every penny and i cant see why it would be any different for London 2012 - London is a great city and it will be on stage for the world to see which can only be a positive thing.\n\nBritish people really need to stop complaining and start enjoying opportunities such as hosting the olympics, get down there and get involved and maybe, just maybe, be greatful to be involved in something that is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nMark\n\nThe Olympics is a political event for the benefit of the politicians themselves, their cronies and financial backers, and a few elite athletes who are able to compete. Indeed when the modern Olympics began manual workers were forbidden from competing, and only \"gentlemen\" were allowed.\n\nThe only noticeable impact of the 2012 Olympics for most Londoners will be increased Council Tax bills. Any facilities built as a result will be in the wrong place and of the wrong kind to provide any benefit for most of the residents, and London will become so congested during the event that it will be impossible to carry on life as normal.\n\nEric Brightwell\n\nI really can't see how the Government and in particular Mrs Tessa Jowell, Ken Livingston and Seb Coe can envisage the Olympics to be beneficial to everyone.\n\nFor me that is inconceivable, there are roughly 20 million Londoner (if my stats are accurate) and I can't see how it will, It is costing us (me) hugely already when considering life in London so costly already and for Mrs Jowell to say it will, I want to know how and in what particular way?\n\nCavelle H. Batchelor\n\nI don't live in London, I come from Belfast but live in the Netherlands.\n\nI think it's a really nice prospect to think that 'the games are for everyone' but, without being honest, this will only be remembered as a propaganda stunt to get public backing for the games.\n\nIn any instances where there are benefits to be had, I'm sure the way to avail of them would be to try, not to sit at home and wait for someone to knock on your door.\n\nKieran van Merkom\n\n'Will the Olympics benefit me or will they have no effect at all' was your question. How wonderful would it be if I could say that the Olympics would have no effect on me and my community but sadly that is not the case.\n\nI can only see that it will have endless detrimental effects on the city that I love and the people who live here. Not only is it costing me money which I do not have and about which, despite my objections, I can do nothing but money has also been taken away from other areas of London life, most notably the arts, which are of far greater long-term benefit to the city. And on top of all that it will be well-nigh impossible to spend time in inner London when 2012 actually arrives in a city which is already frenetically busy and which will become impossible to negotiate in any comfort.\n\nI could go on....and on and on but just wanted to register my voice and say that I am only surprised that your poll did not reveal even higher numbers who feel we have been railroaded into hosting an event that will do untold financial damage to London and its citizens.\n\nLynne Clark\n\nI was dismayed to hear, yet again, negative reporting of the London Olympics with the disadvantages. Whilst I understand you have a responsibility to report on all aspects, you seem to have adopted a negative bias and are not giving us a full and overall picture.\n\nI live in Dorking and would like to know more about the progress on the building and development of the Olympic sites, the facilities, the transport systems and so on, perhaps reports from businesses who are looking forward to 2012.\n\nChristine Baron\n\nAt last someone has asked real people as to what they think of the games. Most people that I know and talk to think the cost unbelievable now, can't imagine the final cost and the public that foot the bill have nothing to say in the matter and will get nothing out of it. We are not having the wool pulled over our eyes much as they try.\n\nVal Mowatt, Londoner\n\nMy view on the 2012 is as follows - the population of this country will soar through the arrival of 'tourists' coming to watch the games and surprisingly not going home - they'll just disappear into the system - claiming asylum when the games are all over - and guess what - they'll be allowed to stay.\n\nJanet\n\nI have always supported the London Olympics as a National Initiative that will bring a great deal to this country. However, the preparations and cost management gives me concern. This government cannot manage such a specialist project and they have a reputation of wasting money. What concerns me is the constant reference to the London Olympics on virtually every SE News bulletin. This is probably why so many Londoners are fed up with the subject and why you run the risk of being just a puppet of the London Labour politics.\n\nBob Wallis\n\nSix weeks prior to the \"winning\" of the Games and the first London terrorist bombings, I e-mailed Ken Livingstone stating that London did not want the Games on the grounds of (a) Terrorism (b) Infrastructure - the roads are too narrow (c) Cost.\n\nAs expected, I received no reply as with the arrogance of all politicians who only act in self interest i.e.votes.\n\nIan Armitage", "images": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/aa4ed2b080840a0ca657c686ef791634fec94e53.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/6833cdf2b474098da5cc64eccaf5212774c8e567.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/55a720bbc4169ce226f6fd25478f2c79a81bfc84.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/4ce2251c28db82aa892a105b718dba4d6a74c327.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/b9992e0d7aea48d94ecff8f90065d3b92bf7920e.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2824615a6625ef5066369945c628713b9cb44116.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a81003ba483f8cccad478c53d4f1d3836e593e4d.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/5ea3e7590d674d9be4582cc6f6c8e86070157686.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/759d760f9f84fade646cbdd2ee1fa05c41d58453.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/124e3bbb55ac5cc3a1105b27168c9fe9ac5b72bc.jpg"], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/b9992e0d7aea48d94ecff8f90065d3b92bf7920e.jpg", "date": "03/04/2008"}, "rank_261": {"title": "Sporting legacy \u2013 whose responsibility?", "text": "by Kurt Barling\n\nQueen Elizabeth Stadium in Enfield, north London, was built in the post Olympic glow of 1948.\n\n\n\nOfficially inaugurated in 1953, the year of the Coronation, QE served many generations of school athletes. Local children of all ages, including myself, pitted themselves against their local peers. A few even went on to achieve athletic greatness. All this was provided and maintained out of local government revenues.\n\nIn recent years the stadium has begun to look tired and worn. Maintenance of the infrastructure has waned and many local people have begun to wonder if this reflects the commitment to keep young people involved in sport.\n\nQueen Elizabeth Stadium in Enfield Last week, almost unnoticed, the athletics running track was closed after it failed a UK Athletics safety inspection. Perhaps ironically, one of the last athletes to use the track in early May was Dwain Chambers. Still committed to his Olympic dream he had been maintaining his fitness there in isolation.\n\nA few weeks ago when he turned up to train he was turned away. Chambers says: \u201cIt\u2019s a great shame because once you lose these facilities it\u2019s hard to get them back. The key thing here is it's local and is accessible and helps get kids on the track\u2026. Fewer tracks available now means fewer Olympic (track and field) gold medals in the future.\u201d\n\nThe future of the stadium has been hotly debated in recent months. Various local sporting outfits, football, rugby, athletics would like to use the venue but no agreement can be brokered without the participation of the local authority because it is their land and their responsibility to get the best value for money for local council tax payers.\n\nEnfield Council has denied that closing the venue in May will have any impact on local schools, citing the new high performance centre at Lee Valley as a viable alternative for school sports days.\n\n\"Fewer tracks available now means fewer Olympic (track and field) gold medals in the future\" Dwain Chambers At least one local school has said it cannot find an alternative and has cancelled its sports day. Others say as a venue it is difficult for students and parents to get to so if there is no alternative next year they may consider ending sports days.\n\nMoreover the local authority is in no position to offer Lee Valley as an alternative because they do not own the site and have no means of ensuring local schools get priority.\n\nEnfield Council did tell BBC London that it is: \u201c..committed to ensuring a viable future for the Queen Elizabeth II Stadium as a sports stadium and is currently consulting residents and the local sporting community about how they would want to use it in the future\u201d.\n\nSport England has an online inventory of sports facilities around the country. In London it lists 21 athletics tracks including the QE stadium and the Barn Elms athletics track, managed by Richmond Upon Thames council. The latter is also under threat.\n\nAs in Enfield, local people in Barnes have discovered that it has become less of a priority for maintenance. The council has said the only way to raise the investment funds needed to rejuvenate the facilities is by selling off some of the public land.\n\nThe council has put on hold a sell-off plan in order that the local community can come up with \u00a34 million pounds to save the playing fields and facilities for public use.\n\nIt is very difficult to see how a legacy can be created out of the Olympics when local decisions like these seem to pass under the radar of those supposedly responsible for building it.\n\nDwain Chambers For this to happen there needs to be a cultural change. The new Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has appointed Kate Hoey MP as his Olympics adviser. It seems that if she is to come to grips with the legacy issue she will need to scrutinise on Londoners' behalf many of these decisions that are being taken at a local level.\n\nIndeed the Mayor and his advisers already have within City Hall a document which maps out the scale of the problem.\n\nIn May 2006 the Greater London Authority carried out an audit of playing fields in the capital and found that there were around 1500 in total. Most are owned and managed by local authorities on behalf of communities; many others are managed by clubs or private organisations.\n\nThe report recognises that in the past five years the loss of playing fields has slowed down but that lack of access, safety and attractiveness of facilities will put people off using them. In these circumstances it becomes easier to justify selling off public land and facilities.\n\nTalking last week to its author London Assembly Member Murad Qureshi he made the simple point that new ways of financing and managing public facilities will be needed if we are to preserve our publicly accessible sporting venues.\n\nFor this to happen there needs to be genuine dialogue between those seeking a sporting legacy, those charged with managing it i.e. local authorities and those communities who will eventually benefit from them.\n\nAt the QE stadium in Enfield the council has no doubt taken advice that it must, for health and safety reasons, keep the public out. I understand that a local Athletics Partnership has sought to keep the facility open by offering to do the maintenance work that the council won\u2019t do. That offer has, allegedly, been ignored.\n\nSeven local secondary schools canvassed for their views have said that the facility is a key part of their ability to deliver a sporting curriculum. They would like to see the facilities maintained for their use.\n\nLocal boy Dwain Chambers, who started his athletics career on the cinders track at Finsbury Park, has had his ups and plenty of recent downs in sport. But he believes that as a sporting nation if we don\u2019t preserve them now, we will regret the lack of facilities after the 2012 Olympics because without them young people cannot get involved in his sport.\n\nIt is to be seen just how effective local consultation will be over the coming months. Based on this consultation, the plan is to have a range of proposals on the table by the autumn. These will then be put to the local decision makers who in turn have promised to let local people know what the choices are before finalising what should be done.\n\nIf an Olympic legacy is to be realised across the capital and beyond, then scrutinising these decisions and not just the building works at Stratford, will be crucial.", "images": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/5473a28c7eba5014908540c25db8d18320a6e5ee.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/bffc98b15c8fe36bab15806f648932886e6b9daa.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/6833cdf2b474098da5cc64eccaf5212774c8e567.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/4ce2251c28db82aa892a105b718dba4d6a74c327.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/5ea3e7590d674d9be4582cc6f6c8e86070157686.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a7921e0e911188ad08be123154e7f8708f128317.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/414b744ff760ac36a0b7396882dc7d3e2c999d63.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/6a9a7005f06284939aeebd9f0bc03f5615c48f1e.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/e9e73c0c2378871d1a641c0fdd2438d1ada6527d.gif"], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/5473a28c7eba5014908540c25db8d18320a6e5ee.jpg", "date": "28/05/2008"}, "rank_248": {"title": "The Consultation Game", "text": "\"It should be fun, it's not a sterile process.\" Tom Russell, LDA Director for Olympic Legacy Construction work on the Olympic Park may be well underway, but plans for what will be left after the games aren't even on the drawing board yet.

The idea is to gather some 'blue sky thinking' from the public, about how the area should be after 2012.\n\nTo help stimulate the imagination and get people involved, the masterplanners have devised a game to help produce a number of legacy scenarios for the site. \"It should be fun, it's not a sterile process\" says Tom Russell, the LDA's Director for Olympic Legacy.\n\nWhere can you play the game?

In the long term he sees some real potential benefits for Hackney residents, 'It's just very good to be associated with a major sports event which will leave a legacy we hope will improve the health of the local population.'\n\nThe view from a Hackney flat, July 2008 Tower Hamlets. By contrast Tower Hamlets will have no new building or transport infrastructure associated with the games. Yet the Olympic Park will be on the doorstep for residents in Bow and Poplar who will no doubt benefit from the facilities. Similarly the borough is optimistic it will gain significant numbers of jobs from the work going on just across its boundaries.\n\nWhitechapel Road will be the main road route for Olympic officials and spectators journeying from Central London out to the new stadium. It's also the longest stretch of road for marathon competitors. As such there's talk of Tower Hamlets branding the road as the main Olympic Boulevard, or 'High Street 2012', though no definite plans have yet been published. Similarly, reports Lebo Diseko, Victoria Park will get an overhaul in advance of 2012, when it will be used for the walking race and also as a venue for various cultural events - though again we still await definitive plans.\n\nFor some in Tower Hamlets there is already disappointment that the boroughs early Olympic dreams, particularly around housing, seem destined to remain only that. Perhaps here, more than in any of the other boroughs, there is a sense of unrealised expectations.\n\nThe Big Screen inWaltham Forest Waltham Forest. One very tangible sign of the Olympic Legacy is already on display in Walthamstow's Town Square. A permanent Big Screen has been erected, and while it launched with coverage of the Beijing Games, it will continue to entertain local people between now and 2012. Cllr Clyde Loakes, leader of Waltham Forest Council, says, \"The legacy started when we won the bid and it'll be shaping this place for the next 20 years\".\n\nEton Manor Park in Leyton is where the Waltham Forest Olympic new-build will be sited. It will host Para Olympic tennis and archery and then transform into a national hockey, tennis and 5-aside football centre. With the new astro-turf facilities available the local hockey club is optimistic it will attract many newcomers to the sport while other young people see the facilities as a way of cutting through gang culture to encourage teenagers to get healthy.\n\nAgain though it's jobs which are a real draw for Waltham Forest residents, which currently has a 7.2 per cent unemployment rate. In her report, Kulwant Sohal met Annika Allen, the borough's role-model and pin-up girl for a new construction training centre in Leytonston. The young mum has successfully retrained there and learnt how to drive fork-lifts. And if she's breaking new ground, so too is the 'Angel of Leyton'. The 120 feet high wind turbine will provide 5% of the energy needed to run the Olympic Park.\n\nHistoric Greenwich Park Greenwich. Although the river divides Greenwich from the Olympic Park, it is by no means the poor relation since it will host a third of Olympic events in 2012. There will be shooting at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, on the Greenwich Peninsula the O2 Arena will be the venue for gymnastics, Para Olympic volleyball, basketball and badminton, while equestrian events will take place in Greenwich Park.\n\n\"We predict up to 9,000 new jobs between now and 2012 because now is our time.\" Deputy Greenwich Council Leader, Cllr Peter Brook It's this last venue which is causing some controversy locally. Not only are residents concerned about access to their park while the games are on, but there are worries the Cross Country event could do permanent damage to the world heritage site. But the park manager is reassuring, insisting the course will avoid ancient trees, burial grounds and other sensitive spots.\n\nGreenwich is the only borough which can already boast one venue which is up and running for the games if they took place tomorrow. O2 is planning basketball and gymnastics events in the next 18 months which will prove its place as a top class venue for those sports. Deputy Council Leader Cllr Peter Brook reflects the upbeat mood in Greenwich when he says, \"We predict up to 9,000 new jobs between now and 2012 because now is our time\".", "images": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/cf56cb3dbc9c5d8cff6a9bf2b132be9bddb67d80.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/bffc98b15c8fe36bab15806f648932886e6b9daa.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/6833cdf2b474098da5cc64eccaf5212774c8e567.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/4ce2251c28db82aa892a105b718dba4d6a74c327.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/3d82a8d202c73957e0c8017a261375f21d5820dd.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/93f56dc23297b3b83cc8b4a3f75e3c3daccc0ef7.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/f70e1dc9b367607ace5209dd11a101164b7253e8.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/81cdf39e897e427ad7b90ca632766cb03bbcbf9b.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/d133d07c477c83511a70bf15733c2f4957a5e250.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/21a0766faa7154d7b05a77ffd16cdcdf0b189571.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/5ea3e7590d674d9be4582cc6f6c8e86070157686.gif", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/e9e73c0c2378871d1a641c0fdd2438d1ada6527d.gif"], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/cf56cb3dbc9c5d8cff6a9bf2b132be9bddb67d80.jpg", "date": "21/08/2008"}, "rank_278": {"title": "London takes over as Olympic host", "text": "London has received the Olympic flag to signal the start of its reign as Olympic host city and spark wild celebrations in the capital. Mayor of London Boris Johnson was given the flag by IOC President Jacques Rogge at the closing ceremony in Beijing. An eight-minute handover presentation, featuring a red double-decker bus, footballer David Beckham and musicians Jimmy Page and Leona Lewis followed. An estimated 40,000 people celebrated the handover at a party in London. Johnson waved the flag four times, as scripted, before handing it to an usher. He will bring the flag back to London on Tuesday and fly it outside City Hall alongside the Paralympic flag when those Games have concluded in September. Johnson displayed the flag at a major celebration in Beijing on Sunday for athletes, organisers, senior politicians including Prime Minister Gordon Brown, spectators and the media. Sport is coming home. See you in London\n\nLondon mayor Boris Johnson \"I'm profoundly humbled by the immense privilege I've been given today,\" said Johnson. \"I'm also intensely proud. Proud of the athletes who pulled in the best medal tally for decades. Proud of the people behind them who've delivered this stunning success. And proud beyond all that London is now in charge of the Olympic legacy. \"The next Games return to a country which I frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport. \"We will draw on that heritage and we will draw on our wit, flair, imagination and ingenuity to build on what we've all witnessed in Beijing and deliver a fantabulous Olympics in what I consider to be not only my home, but the home of sport. \"Sport is coming home. See you in London!\" At the celebration at London House in Beijing, Johnson told the BBC: \"It was a little daunting picking up the flag, but the baton has been passed to a London administration that will deliver. \"This is not going to be a cost-cutting Olympics, but it is essential we watch every penny to deliver a Games that is value for money.\" Please turn on JavaScript.

Prime Minister Brown added: \"It has been an amazing atmosphere here and in London too. \"You can see how it's going to build to 2012 - nights like this make you proud to be British.\" In London thousands of people attended a party in The Mall outside the Queen's residence, Buckingham Palace. They were entertained by musical acts including McFly, Scouting for Girls, Katherine Jenkins, The Feeling and Will Young. Several British Olympians, including cycling's triple gold medallist Bradley Wiggins, silver medal winning triple jumper Phillips Idowu and past stars Sharron Davies, Roger Black and Kate Howey were also present. Wiggins, who won two golds in Beijing to add to his one from Athens, said: \"When I left, it was all 'recession, recession, recession' and we've come back to a country overwhelmed by Olympic success. \"There's an overwhelming sense of people being excited by the next Olympics being in London.\" Idowu added: \"London's going to be crazy. If we have support like this now, it's going to be amazing.\" America's swimming sensation Michael Phelps, who won an record eight gold medals in Beijing, also dropped in.

Just remember to keep it simple and keep it fun and we'll be all right on the night.\n\nMatt Slater He said: \"This is my first trip to London and I am looking forward to coming back in four years to compete in the London Olympics. \"It's been an amazing few weeks, (winning eight gold medals was) a dream come true.\" A spectacular flypast by the Royal Air Force's aerobatics team, the Red Arrows, with their trademark red, white and blue smoke wowed the crowd. And former M People singer Heather Small rounded off the party with a rendition of her hit single Proud. Numerous cities, including 2012 football venue Glasgow and sailing venue Weymouth were hooked up to London via giant screens. The International Olympic Committee awarded the Games of the 30th Olympiad to London on 6 July, 2005. The city won a two-way fight with Paris by 54 votes to 50 at the IOC meeting in Singapore, after bids from Moscow, New York and Madrid were eliminated. Mayor Johnson has told the BBC he is \"absolutely determined\" the 2012 Olympics will cost less than the current \u00a39.3bn budget. London will become the first city to stage the Olympics for a third time in 2012. On both previous occasions, the capital has staged the Games at short notice - Rome pulled out of hosting the 1908 Olympics following the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906. And in 1948, London staged what became known as the Austerity Games following World War II.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

London mayor Boris Johnson has already admitted that it is crucial to make sure the requirements of the media are met.\n\nThere are two basic reasons for that. Firstly, the broadcasters pay millions of pounds for the exclusive rights for the Games and can expect to have decent facilities for their staff.\n\nSecondly, as Johnson admitted, it is important that journalists are happy with their working facilities.

The LDA, the mayor's business and economic agency, had a \u00a31.1bn budget to buy the east London site and relocate its original residents and businesses. The LDA's director of strategy Andrew Travers told London Assembly that he has called in accountants as he expects \"figures will exceed the budget.\" He said the excess will be recouped by \"trimming\" other LDA projects. Mr Travers' questioning at City Hall comes after reports of KPMG auditors finding a funding gap of \u00a360m to \u00a3100m in the LDA budget. Two senior members of staff were suspended from the Olympic Legacy Directorate (OLD), a department within the LDA, following the discovery. The LDA had to pay more than 3,000 businesses and individuals to buy land for the 2012 site in Stratford through compulsory purchase orders but has insisted there is no evidence of wrongdoing. 'Agent's fees' Mr Travers said the process was \"complex\" and that KPMG had been called in to investigate the accounts and make recommendations. Appearing before the Budget Monitoring Sub-Committee Mr Travers said: \"It is the case that the figures will exceed the budget we have previously set aside. \"It is the case that more money was spent on fees in 2008-2009 than envisioned. \"As a consequence of the commitment to be resolved as we move forward over the next couple of years, we will incur agent's fees - that will be part of the equation.\" On the cuts to projects Mr Travers said: \"I think we are determined to make sure that there is minimal impact on LDA projects, particularly the core programmes and including the delivery of legacy.\" Projects for 2009-2010 have already been reviewed and although he did not specify the projects in danger of being axed he said the LDA will look at projects which were \"relatively poor value for money\". Accountants will report their findings to the LDA at the end of July.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

The IOC would also have to approve any change in the stadium's usage. \"If we had said we were building a football stadium, we would not have won,\" Livingstone told BBC Radio 5 live. However, Gold has received political support for his idea from Sir Robin Wales, the Mayor of Newham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne other possibility is to abandon the athletic idea altogether and maybe build a small athletics stadium that can be used for ever\n \n\n\nWest Ham co-owner David Gold\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Newham Mayor said he \"would like West Ham to be in there\", adding it was a \"sensible solution\". The Newham borough is home to the Premier League team's Upton Park ground as well as the Olympic Stadium, which will host two-thirds of the events at the 2012 Games. Wales, who sits on the boards of the Olympic Park Legacy Company and Games organiser Locog, said: \"My view is to develop the stadium as a football stadium in legacy and use the money from West Ham and the developers to then build a proper athletics offer in London. He believes there could be \"a problem with the legacy\" if the club did not move into the \u00a3450m stadium. Gold maintains that a deal for West Ham to relocate there remains a \"serious possibility\". \"I'm sensing an easing of the stance that it should be a legacy to athletics,\" the West Ham co-owner told BBC Radio 5 live. \"We have to be more pragmatic. Do we want to have a stadium like we have at Crystal Palace which just deteriorated and rotted away because it wasn't sustainable? \"We believe there is a serious possibility that we could strike a deal that would take West Ham to the Olympic Stadium. \"If that can be done, we would have a super stadium that could take the club to the next level.\" Gold and co-owner David Sullivan took over the cash-strapped club last month and immediately confirmed their interest in relocating to the 80,000-capacity Olympic Stadium in Stratford as they try to improve the club finances. Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell has insisted that keeping the stadium as a grand prix athletics venue was one of the reasons that London bid for the Games, and keeping the running track at the stadium to leave a legacy to athletics in East London remained a strong commitment. The Olympic Park Legacy Company is to shortly invite bids from businesses that want to apply for a commercial stake in the stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t                            606: DEBATE\n\t\t\t                        \n\n\n\n\n\nHand over Upton Park as a down payment and pay a lease on the new stadium. Seems fair to me\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Ghost of Thierry Henry\n\n\n\n\n\nGold had also floated the idea of West Ham moving to the Olympic venue and then building a separate stadium that could be used for athletic events. \"One other possibility is to abandon the athletic idea altogether and maybe build a small athletics stadium that can be used for ever,\" he said. \"Not as an Olympic athletics stadium but a regional stadium with seating facility commensurate to their requirements which would be about 5,000.\" However, UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner accused the Hammers co-owner of being \"patronising\". \"When we are told we can go to a little regional athletics stadium, I think this is another example of football rather arrogantly thinking it has all the solutions to sports problems in the UK,\" said Warner. The Games are about leaving an \"iconic venue for athletes of all ages and abilities to aspire to compete in\", he added. \n\n\n", "images": ["http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/shared/img/o.gif", "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/47317000/jpg/_47317417_olympic_credit.jpg", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/img/timezone/z.zzz", "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/img/v3/print.gif", "http://stats.bbc.co.uk/o.gif?~RS~s~RS~Sport~RS~t~RS~HighWeb_Story~RS~i~RS~8527366~RS~p~RS~46693~RS~a~RS~International~RS~u~RS~/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/8527366.stm~RS~r~RS~(none)~RS~q~RS~~RS~z~RS~31~RS~", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/img/v3/dot_629.gif", "http://stats.bbc.co.uk/o.gif?~RS~s~RS~News~RS~t~RS~HighWeb_Legacy~RS~i~RS~0~RS~p~RS~0~RS~u~RS~/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/8527366.stm~RS~r~RS~(none)~RS~a~RS~International~RS~q~RS~~RS~z~RS~31~RS~", "http://static.bbci.co.uk/frameworks/barlesque/5.0.0/desktop/2.8/img/blocks.png", "http://static.bbci.co.uk/frameworks/barlesque/5.0.0/desktop/2.8/img/blocks/light.png", "https://sa.bbc.co.uk/bbc/bbc/s?name=SET-COUNTER&ml_name=webmodule&ml_version=-1&blq_js_enabled=0&blq_s=2.8d&blq_r=2.7&blq_v=journalism-worldwide&blq_e=webservice-HTML&app_type=web&language=en-GB", "http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/img/v3/email.gif"], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "22/02/2010"}, "rank_117": {"title": "West Ham's Olympic stadium plan angers Kelly Sotherton", "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSotherton says handing the stadium to West Ham would be \"out of order\"\n\n\n\n\nOlympic and world heptathlon bronze medallist Kelly Sotherton has hit out at West Ham's plans to take over the Olympic stadium after the 2012 Games.New Hammers owners David Sullivan and David Gold want to leave Upton Park and lease the newly built stadium in nearby Stratford as the club's new home. However, Sotherton insists the stadium should remain an athletics venue. \"The legacy should be athletics. It's out of order that football think they can just come and have it,\" she said. \"We don't have a national athletics stadium and we need one. We lost our last big stadium to Manchester City in 2002 after a great Commonwealth Games and the fear is now that we'll lose another one to football. \"I'm a massive fan of football and a big Arsenal fan, but at the end of the day it's our stadium and I think the legacy is to enable us to stage future world and commonwealth championships - who knows, maybe another Olympics. \"To have an Olympic stadium turned into a football stadium by a club struggling near the foot of the Premier League, it's out of order.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t                            606: DEBATE\n\t\t\t                        \n\n\n\n\n\nI've heard people go on about the arrogance of football fans, but I think it's the athletics people who are being arrogant and unrealistic here\n\n\n \n\n\nAdam Z Lucifer \n\n\n\n\n\nWest Ham's plans have already met opposition from outside the world of football, with Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell, ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone and UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner among those speaking out against the move. One of the arguments is that London would not have won the 2012 Games had the Olympic committee heard that the stadium would be turned into a football ground. Sullivan and Gold remain unperturbed, though, and are confident a deal can be struck. Gold believes the deterioration of the specialist athletics track at Crystal Palace provides an example that an athletics stadium, in itself, is unsustainable. However, Sotherton told BBC Five Live: \"Of course athletics can't use it every week, but I'm sure uses can be found for it in the off-season - rock concerts for example. \"We just don't have a stadium that replicates the size and grandeur of an Olympic stadium.

Labour MP for Vauxhall Kate Hoey told the London Evening Standard she had \"no idea\" what was happening regarding the promised 2012 legacy beyond London. Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams said Wales was losing out on \u00a3437m funding. But a UK government spokesperson said Wales was realising sporting, economic and cultural opportunities. Ms Hoey, who was UK sports minister from 1999 to 2001, is reported to have said that there's been \"a government failure\" regarding the legacy of the games for the entire country. Kate Hoey was UK sports minister from 1999 to 2001 She told the newspaper: \"The rest of the country was also promised legacy and I have no idea what is happening... unless things change I fear a backlash.\" Mr Williams, MP for Caernarfon, said Wales was losing out on around \u00a3437m of Olympic funding and that \"we will have little or nothing to show for it instead\". Last year a report by MPs on the Welsh Affairs Select Committee estimated Wales could lose around \u00a3100m in lottery funding to pay for the London games. The London Olympics are considered as 'UK spending' in government funding terms, so don't trigger the so-called 'consequential' additional Welsh funding that they would if classified as spending for England alone. Plaid Cymru argue that Wales is missing out on around \u00a3330m as a result. In my constituency in North West Wales the positive impact of the Olympics will be limited, if not non-existent\n\nHywel Williams MP Mr Williams said: \"In my constituency in north west Wales the positive impact of the Olympics will be limited, if not non-existent. \"However, the London Olympics will be based almost exclusively in the south-east of England, less than a handful of business contracts have been given to Welsh firms, London politicians have admitted that it is a scam to use public money to regenerate one of Europe's richest cities and those currently in the Labour UK Government refuse to admit that Wales will lose out.\" Benefits to Wales A Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) spokeswoman said Welsh businesses were winning both direct and supply-chain Olympic contracts. She said Welsh companies were providing the steel frame for the Aquatics Centre and the steel reinforcement system for the Olympic Stadium. The spokeswoman added that 32 venues in Wales had been identified as potential pre-games training camp venues, the Australian National Paralympic committee had signed an agreement to hold camps in Wales and the Millennium Stadium would host rounds of the football competition. She added: \"Wales will have four major projects funded by a \u00a31.67m grant from the Legacy Trust, under the title: The Power of the Flame. \"This will offer young people opportunities for personal development through artistic and sporting events and there will be live sites in Cardiff and Swansea where people can watch the games and join the celebrations in 2012.\" A spokesperson for the Sports Council for Wales said \"It is essential that we maximise on the potential and use the lead up to the games to provide opportunities in a wide range of sports and to help unite a proud sporting nation here in Wales.\"\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

The American sports and entertainment company is one of 106 parties to have expressed an interest in assuming control of the venue after 2012. Potential bidders have until 17 May to register their interest in the 80,000-seater stadium at Stratford. A shortlist of about 30 is expected to be drawn up, with a final decision to be announced in March 2011. With West Ham's new owners declaring their interest in converting the venue into a football arena two months ago, it was thought the Premier League club offered the only viable plan for the future of the stadium that would prevent it from becoming an expensive white elephant. DAVID BOND BLOG Beyond a professional football or rugby team, how many sports events could AEG realistically attract to Stratford given the Football Association's need to keep Wembley's schedules busy to pay off its huge debts?\n\nBut AEG, which has turned the failing Dome into a successful sport and concert venue, could offer a real alternative if it decides to go ahead with a bid to become the operating company for the \u00a3547m stadium. Details of how AEG, which owns a number of big stadiums and venues in the United States, including the Staples Center in Los Angeles, plans to use the venue are not yet clear. Talks with the Olympic Park Legacy Company are at a very early stage but an AEG spokesperson told the BBC: \"AEG has expressed an initial interest in the future of the Olympic Park and, as the world's leading sports venue owner and operator, it makes total sense for us to explore potential ideas for its future success. \"At this time, we are reviewing the information about the venues to properly assess the legacy opportunities for all stakeholders, current and future.\" AEG's declaration of interest is believed to have come last week and will be a boost to Baroness Margaret Ford, the chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, who brokered the sale of the Dome to AEG while working as a government adviser. The O2 arena is now a successful sports and entertainment venue The future use of the Olympic Stadium has been one of the most controversial and difficult issues for London Olympic organisers to handle. Officials had originally planned to reduce London's 'flat-pack' stadium from its 80,000-capacity configuration at Games time to a 25,000-seater arena for athletics. But the need to retain the running track and accommodate a warm-up facility next to the stadium has put off potential tenants. Not only would they be expected to foot the bill for converting and downsizing the arena but they would need to maintain London's commitment to athletics - such a crucial part in Lord Coe's successful pitch to the International Olympic Committee in 2005. A deal with West Ham looked to have slipped away until the appointment of Baroness Ford, who announced a review of the process in July 2009, insisting all options remained open. In March, West Ham announced they had teamed up with Newham Council to launch a bid to turn the stadium into a 60,000-capacity venue during the winter, with which could then be used for athletics meetings in the summer. As part of the proposal, there would also be provision for a school and an NHS walk-in centre within the stadium, while the Hammers would look to expand their community schemes. Avoiding relegation to the Championship will undoubtedly ensure West Ham remain favourites to take control of the venue. West Ham's owners will need around \u00a3100m to convert the stadium But there remain serious questions over how club owners David Sullivan and David Gold will raise the estimated \u00a3100m needed to convert the stadium, which will have no corporate boxes or hospitality facilities in Games mode. Essex County Cricket Club have also expressed an interest in playing some of their Twenty20 matches at the arena, while the NFL told the BBC they would be willing to look at the potential for playing American Football games there. The 106 expressions of interest will be seen by the Government as vindication of their handling of the search for a legacy tenant, although sources stress that many of that number will not be considered serious potential bidders. Tessa Jowell, Olympics Minister, said: \"This confirms that we are not going to have white elephants in the Olympic Park. \"There is a lot of commercial interest in the park and that is very encouraging three or so years out from the moment when someone will actually have to take over the running of the venues.\"\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

But organisers scrapped that and ordered a review last July when it became clear track and field alone would not cover the estimated \u00a31m-a-year running costs.\n\nHaving allocated \u00a39.3bn of public money for the Games, the idea of leaving London taxpayers with the costly burden of running the venue after the Olympics has caused many an official to break out in a cold sweat.\n\nFinancial turmoil at West Ham - caused by meltdown in Iceland - looked to have ended any hopes of the only realistic Premier League club moving in.\n\nBut then new owners David Gold and David Sullivan announced last March they would be interested in taking on the stadium and converting it from an 80,000-seater stadium to a 60,000-capacity football ground, crucially keeping the running track to ensure London maintained its commitment to athletics.\n\nAEG, who own London's O2 arena, have shown an interest in the 2012 Olympic Stadium\n\nYet there are serious question marks over whether Gold and Sullivan will be able to raise the \u00a3100m-\u00a3150m cost of converting the venue. That is why Baroness Margaret Ford, the woman charged with leading a search for a long-term tenant or owner of the stadium, will be relieved AEG has thrown its hat in the ring.\n\nAt this stage, it is no more than an initial interest but the American sports and leisure giant insists it is keen to explore the possibilities, perhaps not only with the stadium but with other venues at the Olympic Park in Stratford.\n\nAEG's track record in turning the troubled Millennium Dome into the successful O2 arena will give Ford and ministers hope it could do the same with the stadium, although there have to be doubts over whether the East End of London could accommodate two multi-sports and concert venues.\n\nAnd beyond a professional football or rugby team, how many sports events could AEG realistically attract to Stratford given the Football Association's need to keep Wembley's schedules busy to pay off its huge debts?\n\nAt this stage, it is hard to tell exactly what AEG might have in mind. But it is worth noting that Baroness Ford played a key role as a Government adviser in setting up the \u00a3700m deal for AEG to take over the Dome.\n\nCould it be she has encouraged AEG to show an interest with the Olympic Stadium to ensure West Ham are not the only bidder in town? Even if that is the case, at least the signs are a little more encouraging on venue legacy.\n\nOn the wider vision of using the London Olympics to inspire a sporting renewal in the United Kingdom, things are a little less clear.\n\nAll three of the main political parties talk in their manifestos of ensuring a legacy from the Olympics. All three are light on detail, it is fair to say. For now, there is no sign that the \u00a3100m a year Britain's top athletes receive to prepare for the London Games is unlikely to be cut by whoever is in the Treasury come Friday morning.\n\n\n\nBut, given the huge squeeze that is coming to cut the public sector deficit, sport's great fear is that funding will be cut after the Games. If that happens, then delivering that legacy will only get harder.\n\n", "images": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/0973a0212ae804ad7d24ee33fb84d7aa1d9b02ff.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a8e42f8fe987b7cc9bf2d43b74b2c74b2448d2e3.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/bb6bdeccf20847e32d015a6659b010464a4bf035.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2e00d1d53e9c3bd91993196aa19a1d88589969f0.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/cd7d13097065ffbf5efa9b92e0f6258333771be7.gif"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "04/05/2010"}, "rank_87": {"title": "Adrian Warner: Mayor aims for total control of 2012 legacy", "text": "London Mayor Boris Johnson is set to take complete control over what will happen to the 2012 Olympic Park after the Games.\n\nThe Mayor today announced a shake-up of the way London runs its affairs, including a reform of the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC).\n\nThe OPLC was set up last year as a company half owned by the Mayor and half owned by the Government.\n\nThis meant that any major decision, such as the future of the main stadium, needed the approval of Johnson, the Olympics Minister and the Communities Secretary, who handles regeneration issues.\n\nThe new plans mean the Mayor has complete control over the OPLC which will be reformed as a Mayoral Development Corporation.\n\nForget all the names of these bodies.\n\nWhat matters is that Johnson will now decide whether West Ham move into the stadium or whether it is going to become a new centre for pop concerts.\n\nHe has the only veto over any proposals put forward by legacy officials.\n\nWith this, of course, comes more risk for London. If everything goes wrong and London is left with a Park of white elephants, it is likely to be harder for Johnson to go begging to the Government for more cash to pay for the mess since Whitehall will have had no say in the decisions.\n\nBut it's not all negative. I understand the people in power in the Olympic Park Legacy Company agree with the move because it will make it much easier to negotiate deals.\n\nCompanies keen to invest in the Park won't have to go and get the Government's approval as well as the Mayor's.\n\nSo will it change the future of the Park?\n\nWell, we know that Boris is more flexible on letting a football club into the stadium than his predecessor Ken Livingstone was.\n\nWe also know that he is determined to strike deals which work financially. Under these new plans, he is going to be even more determined to focus on the bottom line because he has total responsibility for the Park's future.\n\nWe'll have to see whether that means the promises of the bid - such as a major athletics legacy - will be watered down in the rush to make sure the Park doesn't lose money.", "images": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/ef322e7f8807f40bdfb840c22c14c5e2f1b2578a.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/835dc8749270d7454a49a321003f73e90e0993f3.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a8e42f8fe987b7cc9bf2d43b74b2c74b2448d2e3.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/88b25a35034f0881a216c29bfb5e4cff933f3e63.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2e00d1d53e9c3bd91993196aa19a1d88589969f0.png"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "15/06/2010"}, "rank_109": {"title": "Matt Slater: London's legacy luxuries face the chop", "text": "One of my favourite quotes of recent years is Arsene Wenger's bemused reaction to the emergence of Britain as a swimming power at the 2008 Olympics.\n\n\"I didn't know the British were good at swimming,\" Wenger said after Rebecca Adlington led Team GB's swimmers to six medals in Beijing. \"I've been in this country for 12 years and haven't seen a pool.\"\n\nWenger's powers of observation are not his strong point - he has not seen a foul by an Arsenal player since arriving in London - but he could be forgiven for missing Britain's swimming facilities, they are few and far between compared to his native France.\n\nWhich is why last week's news that the government was axing a scheme to provide free swimming for under-16s and over-60s was so disappointing: understandable, given the state of our finances, but disappointing.\n\n\n\nWill this move hinder hopes of developing young stars to follow Adlington? Photo: Getty\n\nIt was also a very damp end for a scheme launched with such fanfare by former Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell in June 2008.\n\nBack then this was just the beginning. Swimming would be free for all by the time of the London Olympics and a key plank in the much-trumpeted plan to use the 2012 Games as a tool to get Britain off the sofa and into sport.\n\nThe trumpeting continued last year, with ministers diving in to praise the scheme. Sir Terrence of Wogan was even moved to call it a \"great idea than can only do good\".\n\nBut countries in the red to the tune of \u00a336,000 for every household in the land cannot afford do-gooding, particularly when most of the people who took advantage of the scheme apparently did not need subsidising.\n\n\n\nFigures released by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport last week revealed that the initiative had paid for 18 million \"free\" swims during its first year but 83% of those aged over 60 and 73% of those under 16 said they would have gone swimming anyway and were happy to pay for it.\n\nDid they mean it? I guess we'll never know. But I am sorry to see the end of an initiative that got 114,000 extra under-16s in a pool every month.\n\nIt was a point picked up on Monday by the Labour MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East, Paul Goggins.\n\nNoting that the pools in his constituency had recorded a 56% increase in usage, Goggins asked: \"Where's the value in cutting a scheme that helps to keep (youngsters) healthy?\"\n\nIt is a good question, and to be fair to the new Sport and Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson he does not seem especially happy about it either.\n\n\"This is not a decision that gives me any pleasure,\" he said. \"But with a crippling deficit to tackle and tough decisions to take, this has become a luxury we can no longer afford.\"\n\nThe real concern for him, however, is that this \"tough decision\" only saves his budget \u00a35m.\n\nFunding for the Free Swimming Programme comes from five different government departments (getting big-spenders like Education and Health to contribute to a sports initiative really was a good idea and should be repeated) and \u00a3100m of the total two-year allocation of \u00a3140m has already been spent.\n\nSo the saving here is more symbolic than real and his boss, Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt, needs real savings to appease the coalition government's austerity police, which is why nobody in the wider sports family thinks this will be the end of it.\n\nThe County Sports Partnerships sponsored by central government lost their \u00a36m funding last week and \u00a327m was knocked off London 2012's previously ring-fenced \u00a39.3bn budget last month.\n\nThere are fears a more painful raid on the Games' contingency cash will be announced by Chancellor George Osborne in his Budget on Tuesday but I think that's unlikely. Not impossible, though.\n\nWhat is far more likely is a big shake-up of how sport is funded in this country after 2012. Broadly speaking, there will be a lot less money from the government's own coffers, a bit more from the National Lottery and the difference will be made up by cuts in overheads and \"waste\".\n\nAt present there are three main bodies in this space: UK Sport, Sport England (with equivalents in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) and the Youth Sport Trust. UK Sport distributes money to elite sportsmen and women, Sport England is the agency for grassroots sport and the Youth Sport Trust deals with schools.\n\nThey all have different budgets and remits but there is some overlap, which is hardly surprising given the desire to create a \"pathway\" from amateur competition to the sharp end of elite sport.\n\nRobertson, however, clearly sees some duplication of effort here.\n\nIn a speech earlier this month, the minister said he was pushing ahead with plans to bring the three bodies \"under one roof while maintaining their separate roles and responsibilities\".\n\nAt first I thought he meant this more metaphorically than literally - UK Sport and Sport England already have London offices (and they seem pretty full), while the Youth Sport Trust is an independent charity based in Loughborough.\n\nBut I am assured by people who know better that he does actually mean \"under one roof\".\n\nRobertson thinks this move can happen in the medium term and it will save money. Money that can then be better targeted at meeting the government's inherited goal of getting one million people playing more sport by 2013.\n\nThe most recent figures show that just over seven million adults in England play some kind of sport (the definition is a little elastic) at least three times a week. That is up 700,000 since 2005 but still 800,000 short of the \"million more\" target that was set in 2007.\n\nI have always felt that achieving London 2012's \"participation legacy\" would be a tall order, especially now that we cannot afford a relatively cheap and cheerful scheme like free swimming, but that does not mean we should not try.\n\nSport does not exist in a bubble so we are just going to have to do more with less. I wonder if Fabio Capello is willing to muck in too.\n\nAs well as my blogs, you can follow me when I'm out and about at https://twitter.com/bbc_matt\n\n", "images":

"rank_266": {"title": "Deadline set for 2012 London Olympics stadium bids", "text": "The stadium's roof cover was completed in July\n\nBy David Bond\n\nBBC Sports Editor\n\nBidders interested in taking over the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games will be told on Wednesday that they must submit fully costed and financed plans by the end of September. Having received 150 expressions of interest in the \u00a3547m venue in May, the Olympic Park Legacy Company now wants to see firm proposals from those individuals and companies keen to convert the stadium and then run it on a 99-year lease. Organisers had planned to scale down the stadium following the Olympics, converting it from an 80,000-capacity arena to a 28,000-seater track and field venue. But with athletics unable to afford the estimated annual \u00a32m running costs, Baroness Ford, chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, announced a rethink last summer. 606: DEBATE The future of the stadium now appears to hinge on the age-old conundrum of whether track and field can share with Premier League football. West Ham are the early front runners and have been working closely with Newham Council on a \u00a3125m proposal, which would turn the stadium into a 60,000-capacity venue and retain the running track, allowing several athletics events each year. The plan includes a number of community projects, such as a health centre and a school. The main bowl of the stadium would be largely untouched, with 20,000 seats removed and larger video screens installed at either end of the venue, which is now 75% complete. But the bulk of the conversion cost comes from adding a roof to cover the entire stadium, which would also involve moving the distinctive floodlights. At the moment, only a third of the stadium will be covered. There are also plans to add corporate hospitality and dining facilities, now such a crucial part of any Premier League football ground. West Ham co-owner David Gold is keen to move the club to Stratford Finding the money to pay for those changes remains the stumbling block to West Ham's bid. The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) has set aside \u00a336m in its budget to pay for the old plan of converting the main stadium to a smaller athletics and community complex. West Ham would also be able to use the proceeds from the sale of their current Upton Park home to help fund the conversion. Early estimates suggest that could raise somewhere between \u00a315m and \u00a320m. But that still leaves a hole of about \u00a370m. One option being discussed would result in Newham Council taking advantage of its local authority status to use what is known as prudential borrowing - a cheap form of credit only open to government organisations. Newham would be willing to consider this but probably not for the full amount, which means West Ham must raise the rest of the money themselves or strike a deal with the government to finance the remaining conversion costs. That is likely to prove difficult in the current economic climate but the ODA's total budget for legacy development of the Olympic Park runs to \u00a3350m. Karren Brady, West Ham's managing director, is likely to try to drive a hard bargain, knowing ministers will be anxious to avoid the alternative of financing annual running costs. Officials are known to be keen to do a deal similar to the one that Manchester City struck with Manchester City Council after the Commonwealth Games in 2002. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Although Eastlands is owned by the council, the football club financed the \u00a330m conversion costs and pay an annual rent to the local authority, which includes an extra payment, depending on attendances. Tottenham have also expressed an interest in the stadium but it is thought this is only a tactic to try to force through their plans to stay at White Hart Lane with Haringey Council As revealed by the BBC in May, the most serious rival to West Ham is the American entertainment company AEG, who rescued the failing Millennium Dome by creating the successful O2 arena. But without a regular sports team - an idea to play NFL games there appears to have stalled for the time being - they would struggle to justify their bid. One option now being discussed is a joint bid from West Ham and AEG, with the American company awarded a contract by the football club for running concerts and other events at the stadium. They could also help raise capital to finance conversion costs. Baroness Ford wants to avoid leaving a costly legacy to the public purse and, with other venues such as the aquatics centre, velodrome and media centre also requiring legacy tenants, will choose one or two preferred bidders for the stadium in the autumn before making a final decision before Christmas. It could then take until next March to complete a deal.\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

Sports Minister Hugh Robertson announced the new Places People Play initiative in London on Monday. The plan is funded by the National Lottery and focuses on facilities, volunteers and inspiring participation. \"This is the cornerstone of a grassroots legacy from hosting the Games because it enables everybody to play sport,\" said Robertson. \"With more lottery money being invested in facilities, volunteering and protecting and improving playing fields, there will be more opportunities for everyone to get involved.\" What the five-year scheme, which provides \u00a390m for venues and playing fields, does not do is tie itself to any fixed targets. The last government initially made a legacy commitment of getting two million people more active, although that later became a pledge to get one million more people playing more sport. The legacy promise we made to this country's young people is yet another promise that has been broken by the Coalition Government\n\nLabour's former Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell But overall targets were conspicuous by their absence in Robertson's announcement, with the only vague commitment being that this would \"encourage more people to get involved in sport\". Critics will suggest this confirms the widely-held perception that the \"million more\" goal has been dropped, or at least relegated to \"aspiration\" status. There were some targets, though, for the volunteer recruitment drive and try-a-sport elements of the plan: finding and training 40,000 more \"sports leaders\" to organise grassroots activities, and inspiring 100,000 adults to \"test themselves in Olympic and Paralympic sports\". The volunteering scheme, which taps into Prime Minister David Cameron's concept of a \"big society\", will lean heavily on the work already done by the various national governing bodies for sports and national coaching organisations, such as Sport Leaders UK. And the push to promote participation, dubbed Gold Challenge, bears a close resemblance to an existing British Olympic Association (BOA) programme that focuses on personal development and goal-setting. It is hoped adults who take part in Gold Challenge events will raise \"millions of pounds for charity\" and there will also be high expectations of a campaign called Sportivate that will give youngsters six weeks of coaching in the sport of their choice. Sport England, the agency responsible for English community sport, will run the Places People Play programme with the backing of the key London 2012 stakeholders, the BOA, British Paralympic Association (BPA) and the Games' organising committee (Locog). This will harness the power of the Games to promote sport and leave a lasting legacy of facilities, volunteers and more people participating in sport\n\nLondon 2012 chairman Seb Coe Jennie Price, Sport England's chief executive, said: \"We can't all be Olympians or Paralympians but with great local facilities, inspirational sports leaders on the ground and sporting challenges to suit everyone, we can all be part of the mass participation legacy. \"We want to bring both the Games and grassroots sport to life to ensure that, in challenging times, sport receives the investment and attention it needs at a local level.\" Price's mention of \"challenging times\" draws attention to another key element of this initiative - just how new is this money? A precise answer to this question is difficult to establish as Sport England claims \u00a3100m of this package is new, with the rest being reallocated from their existing grant. But increased levels of lottery funding for Sport England - and UK Sport, the agency for elite sport - have already been announced in the wake of last month's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR). That process saw sport lose 30% of its direct funding from government, with the Department of Education-funded School Sports Partnership (SSP) programme being the most high-profile casualty. Labour's Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell gave a withering response to today's announcement. \"The legacy promise we made in Singapore was to transform a generation of young people through sport,\" said Jowell. \"This additional money is welcome but it goes nowhere near replacing the funds already taken away from sport, particularly sport in schools. \"However they dress it up, the Olympic legacy promise that we made to this country's young people is yet another promise that has been broken by the Coalition Government.\" Government officials, however, point to the greatly increased contribution from the lottery as evidence of their commitment to sport. And with many still disappointed about the axing of the SSP scheme (and the earlier abandonment of free swimming for the young and old), the ring-fencing of lottery cash for a community sport legacy plan will come as a relief to the likes of Locog chairman Seb Coe. \"When we bid for the Games in 2005, we said we would use the power of the Games to inspire young people to take up sport,\" said Coe. \"Places People Play will harness the inspirational power of the Games to promote sport and leave a lasting legacy of facilities, trained volunteers and more people participating in sport. This is what we set out to achieve.\"\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

Twitter and Facebook are full of a campaign against the changes and I know secondary schools near to where I live have already started petitions against the cuts.\n\nBut to have a foreign national Olympic committee stepping into the row is an unusual development.\n\nThe letter from Canadian Olympic Committee chief executive Jean Dupre to Education Secretary Michael Gove came about because Canada plans to use the specialist Langdon Park sports school in Tower Hamlets in east London for training during the 2012 Games.\n\nI've been to see the school's headmaster Chris Dunne and he was part of the report we did for the Politics Show which you can see on my blog last week.\n\nHe told me about the Canadian opposition to Gove's plans which resulted in the letter.

That's because the Government is making changes, not only to save money but also because it believes there isn't enough competitive sport in schools. The people who run the SSPs vehemently disagree with this. Somebody must be wrong.\n\nThat's why I see a u-turn ahead. The problem the Government has is that every time it and London 2012 start talking about the sporting legacy of the Games, criticis will simply point to the SSP cuts and dismiss any initiative as meaningless.\n\nWithout an effective sport's system in schools, 2012's talk means nothing, they will say.\n\nAnd it's interesting that schools and former sports stars have been so quick to get the petitions going - and also that the subject has landed at Prime Minister's Questions so fast.\n\nThis story isn't going away in a hurry.", "images": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/835dc8749270d7454a49a321003f73e90e0993f3.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a8e42f8fe987b7cc9bf2d43b74b2c74b2448d2e3.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/88b25a35034f0881a216c29bfb5e4cff933f3e63.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2e00d1d53e9c3bd91993196aa19a1d88589969f0.png"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "27/11/2010"}, "rank_116": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics housing legacy: Penny Bernstock", "text": "Image caption The removal of travellers from the Olympic site means the first legacy was a loss of homes\n\nWe should be cautiously optimistic about London 2012's housing legacy.\n\nThe financial and reputational risk associated with failure will ensure that government and agencies will work to secure a positive outcome.\n\nHowever, there are a number of serious challenges that need to be overcome in order to ensure that London 2012 delivers an inclusive housing legacy that acts as an example of best practice in urban regeneration.\n\nThere is a tendency to associate the housing legacy with the new housing built on the Olympic Park.\n\nHowever, one of the early legacies of London 2012 was the compulsory purchase and subsequent demolition of 425 properties and the relocation of travellers from two sites within what is now the Park.\n\nTherefore the first housing legacy of the Games is a net loss of homes.\n\nWe must also take into account the housing legacy outside the Park itself. Part of the rationale for the massive investment in the Olympic project was that it would provide a kick start for regeneration.\n\nHowever, the regeneration of the Stratford area was well under way before London's successful bid in 2005.\n\nThe construction of 4,850 homes, along-with the largest retail centre in Europe were approved in 2004, and were in part used to support the bid.\n\nSome commentators would argue that without the Games, these developments would have stalled after the housing collapse in 2007 and that London 2012 has restored confidence in the area.\n\nOvercrowding\n\nTake a ride on the DLR from Stratford to Pudding Mill Lane and you will be surprised by the pace of development. Half finished and newly completed towers, comprising mainly one and two bedroom apartments are beginning to dominate the landscape.\n\nInterspersed between these new developments we can see the old Stratford, the high rise towers and blocks of flats that are home to some of Newham's most disadvantaged residents.\n\nImage caption Stratford as a whole is undergoing rapid development\n\nResearch undertaken by Newham council identified Stratford as having the highest level of housing need in the borough; above average unemployment rates and below average incomes.\n\nThe two biggest housing problems relate to children living in high rise flats and overcrowding. Much of this housing will not meet their needs and is not accessible to them.\n\nMost new housing is for sale, a proportion is designated as affordable housing for sale through schemes such as shared ownership.\n\nHowever, research on affordability has indicated that these residents could only enter owner-occupation if prices were very low and this is not the case, and therefore they are dependent on the small number of homes for social rent.\n\nIsle of Dogs warning\n\nThere is a stark warning here from areas such as the Isle of Dogs, also in East London.\n\nThis region underwent massive transformation in the 1980s and as each new scheme was developed it became clear that regeneration would be characterised by the influx of a new population as opposed to a transformation of housing opportunities for existing communities.\n\nImage caption Development of the Isle of Dogs in the 1980s proved out of the reach of many local people\n\nOn the Isle of Dogs as in Stratford, policy makers were keen to rebalance the tenure mix through an increase in owner-occupation.\n\nHousing waiting lists grew and for those residents able to buy, to do so often meant leaving the area as prices became increasingly unaffordable.\n\nMany of these developments offered discounted housing to buy for local residents but for most this was simply not affordable.\n\nPolicy makers will be keen to distance themselves from the social polarisation on the Isle of Dogs, but there are parallels that will need to be addressed if Stratford's residents and more generally people on low incomes are to benefit from regeneration.\n\nRising rent and house prices\n\nA number of studies have indicated that house prices in Olympic cities have increased before the games.\n\nA recent study exploring house price change in post codes near to the Olympic Park identified an average rise of 26% between 2005 and 2010. However, Stratford had the lowest increase of all of the areas studied at 3%.\n\nThere is some concern that an oversupply of housing for sale may lead to a fall in the value of properties, and a lack of interest from private developers in investing in the area\n\nThere is some concern that an oversupply of housing for sale may lead to a fall in the value of properties, and a lack of interest from private developers in investing in the area.\n\nThe overall trend in rental values in Stratford since 2006 has been upwards, although rent levels have fluctuated over time.\n\nTwo bedroom apartments in some of the new developments in Stratford are being marketed at around \u00a3350 per week, and the forthcoming housing benefit cap on two bed properties is currently being proposed at \u00a3290 per week.\n\nThis may result in the exclusion of residents dependent on housing benefit.\n\nFrom the perspective of the government, rising land values and increased demand for land were crucial assumptions in bidding for the games.\n\nLower land values may impact on legacy as resources are cut to compensate for lack of income, resulting in poorer quality housing and neighbourhoods.\n\nOn the other hand a fall in land values may result in more activity from Registered Social Landlords though cuts in housing finance are likely to make this less of a possibility.\n\nAthletes' Village\n\nOne key dimension of the housing legacy is the conversion of the Athletes' Village into housing after the games. Initial plans were for 4,000 homes and this was revised downwards to 2,800. It was argued that this was the result of concerns with regard to the density of the scheme.\n\nIt was envisaged that there would be private sector interest in developing this project, however, this interest did not materialise and in 2009, a funding package was agreed through a mix of grants and loans, and the creation of Triathlon Homes (a consortium of two housing associations and a design company) to purchase around half of these homes.\n\nLondon 2012 - Begin your journey here Sport, news and more 2012 information BBC London 2012\n\nThe proportion of housing provided through Triathlon will all be designated 'affordable', with around half of this for social rent and the other half for sale through a range of 'affordable' housing options.\n\nThis creates a challenging scenario, in the first instance there are still no clear plans about what is to happen to the other 1400 or so homes, raising concerns about the spectre of a half empty development.\n\nSecondly, in order to remain an attractive proposition to the private sector, there may be interventions with regard to the distribution of affordable housing, in favour of more \"desirable\" groups such as key workers, over the long term unemployed.\n\nOne concern that has been raised with regard to legacy is that if half of these homes are for sale, then they may very quickly move from being affordable housing to being market housing.\n\nTherefore there is now a focus on finding ways to ensure that this housing remains affordable over time.\n\nInnovative agenda\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company's (OPLC) revised master-plan for the area is impressive.\n\nGood quality design will be an intrinsic factor in encouraging people to live into this area, and the family homes may provide improved housing opportunities for the many families in housing need in Stratford and beyond.\n\nHomes on the Olympic Park Site to be developed over 25 years\n\n40% of homes will be family sized\n\nNumber of affordable homes in line with London targets (varies but currently about 35-40%)\n\nAthletes' Village will be first area to be converted to housing with 2,800 flats\n\n50% of Athletes' Village to be affordable homes\n\nHowever, the transformation from master plan to reality will be dependent on securing private and public investment and to date there have been real challenges.\n\nThe Olympic Delivery Authority is currently inviting interest from the private sector in developing the remaining part of the Athletes' Village and portions of the Olympic Park. Developers will be cautious in the current context of a depressed housing market.\n\nAs the Games draw closer there are looming public sector cuts, a radical reorganisation of housing entitlements and changes in the governance of the Olympic Legacy with plans to abolish the OPLC and reorganise the Homes and Communities Agency.\n\nThe OPLC is clearly beginning to mark out a vision for the area and this will need a group of focussed individuals charged with the task of seeing this vision through to implementation.\n\nThere are other challenges arising from the proposed new benefits and housing regime; underpinned by reduced housing benefits, higher rents; short term tenancies and less public subsidy.\n\nThe bigger the increase in land values, the more expensive the housing, the greater the need for subsidy will become and without different funding mechanisms it will be difficult for those on low incomes and dependent on housing benefit to live in the new developments.\n\nIn Vancouver there were high ambitions with regards to housing legacy, they too had a vision of a mixed community.\n\nHowever, they have had difficulty selling market housing, and it is estimated that the non-market housing was the most heavily subsidised in the world.\n\nIn London's bid application, it was claimed that the legacy would lead to: \"The regeneration of an entire community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives there\". It is important that we keep our eye on this prize.\n\nPenny Bernstock is a housing consultant at the London East Research Institute, University of East London and is currently writing a book on the potential housing legacies of London 2012.", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/50290000/jpg/_50290633_clayslane.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=uk::news.uk.story.11842549.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:b5c53245-bacb-e059-e040-850a02846523]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/50290000/jpg/_50290633_clayslane.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/50290000/jpg/_50290633_clayslane.jpg", "date": "06/12/2010"}, "rank_191": {"title": "London 2012 Lea Valley River Park project begins", "text": "Work has begun to transform part of the Lower Lea Valley in preparation for the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nThree Mills Green in east London is being rejuvenated as part of a \u00a3635,000 project to make use of disused public spaces.\n\nWork will include creating an events area, a viewing terrace, installing ping pong tables and a petanque court.\n\nIt is the first phase of the Lea River Park project and part of the London Development Agency's Olympic legacy.\n\nDerrick Ashley, chairman of Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, said: \"We are tremendously excited by the impending changes that the \u00a3635,000 funding project allows, transforming Three Mills Island into a significant leisure amenity for existing and future communities throughout the local area and beyond.\"\n\nThe Lea River Park forms the southern end of a corridor of public parkland which will extend 26 miles (42km) from the Lee Valley Regional Park, in Hertfordshire, south to the River Thames at East India Dock Basin.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=uk::news.uk.story.11989029.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:b5c53245-f2ea-e059-e040-850a02846523]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1", "date": "14/12/2010"}, "rank_281": {"title": "London 2012: Athletes want Olympics legacy pledge met", "text": "Tottenham and West Ham have been identified as \"preferred bidders\"\n\nKelly Holmes and Daley Thompson are among a group of UK Olympians urging authorities to keep the Olympic Stadium running track after the 2012 Games.

It would be unacceptable for the stadium to lose the track and effectively become an Olympic Stadium with NO Olympic connection or legacy\n\nAthletes' open letter The Spurs proposal has been deemed \"completely unacceptable\" by UK Athletics (UKA) because their plans for an 80,000-seat stadium would involve ripping up the athletics track. That would break the original pledge for a world-class athletics venue after the 2012 Games. West Ham, however, want to create a 60,000-capacity arena for football, athletics, concerts and community use in a collaboration with Newham Council, a bid endorsed by UKA.

They wrote: \"Here was a stadium that would see young athletes competing for an English schools title run on the same track as Usain Bolt, where Premiership footballers could play whilst club athletes train. \"Here was somewhere that could play host to Twenty20 cricket one week and a pop concert the next.

Look to the Velodrome in Manchester, a true legacy of the 2002 Commonwealth Games that is paying dividends every time British cyclists compete on the world stage. \"As Olympians we are all ardent sports fans and that is why we believe the Olympic legacy HAS to be the Olympic Stadium complete with track. \"It would be unacceptable for the stadium to lose the track and effectively become an Olympic Stadium with NO Olympic connection or legacy.\" BBC commentator Cram, a silver medallist in the 1500m at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, said the Stratford stadium could host major international athletics meetings in the future. \"If you are going to have a stadium of that size it needs to be used well, not only as a national centre for UK athletics but also to host major athletics events in the future,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"While Britain has pulled out for bidding for the 2015 World Championships, there is an intention to bid for the 2017 Worlds - and then there are the future Europeans and Commonwealth Games too. \"The whole idea of an Olympic legacy is that something tangible is left for the sport afterwards.\" ADRIAN WARNER'S BLOG David Cameron played the question with a straight bat, keen not get involved in supporting either of the bids\n\nMeanwhile, the issue of who takes over the stadium after the Olympic Games has been raised during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. The Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, asked David Cameron for his support against the Spurs' bid. But the prime minister refused to become involved, saying that \"recent experience had taught him to stay out of football management\". Earlier this week, London 2012 chairman Lord Coe told a Culture, Media and Sport committee that the organising committee was \"not party\" to the bids process by either Tottenham or West Ham. \"I'm loathe to get into this discussion,\" said Lord Coe, who is also vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations. \"It is not up to us.

Sir Robin Wales told BBC Sport that the coalition's local government settlement was \"savage, wreckless and callous\". Every council in England will have to reduce spending from April. Three of the five Olympic boroughs - Hackney, Tower Hamlets, and Newham are among the 36 local authorities taking the maximum cut of 8.9%. \"These are savage cuts being implemented by the coalition government,\" said Sir Robin. \"We are having to plan huge reductions in expenditure over the next few years.\" Please turn on JavaScript.

But documents released after a Freedom of Information request now show the total cost including purchase price and stamp duty was another \u00a392m on top of that. Local Government Minister Bob Neill said: \"This is just a smokescreen by Robin Wales to deflect away from his reckless spending spree that was exposed this week. \"The \u00a37bn earmarked for the Olympics will not be affected by the local Government settlement.\" Sir Robin says that Newham will have to find savings of \u00a343m next year alone. \"The Government themselves have admitted that their cuts will be directed mainly against poorer people which means that Newham is being hit more fiercely than better off areas of the country,\" he added. \"London's Olympic bid book said the most enduring legacy of the Games must be the regeneration of an entire community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives there. \"For centuries London's East End has been one of the poorest areas in Europe.

The Games have provided a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform the lives of residents and nothing should be spared in ensuring that a lasting legacy is achieved\n\nSir Robin Wales - Newham Mayor Councils have been warned that the funding settlement will inevitably lead to cuts, with unprotected services such as play parks, leisure centres and swimming pools most at risk. \"We are doing everything we can to protect our residents and the services they need and value. We want the Olympics to inspire people and raise their ambitions to be healthier and more prosperous,\" said Sir Robin. \"Newham has been working hard to expand participation in sport and activity through investment in our sports facilities and our promise to continue offering free swims to young people. We are providing the largest programme of free sport and activity in London. We will do our utmost to defend these pioneering initiatives and support hard working low income families. \"Inevitably, however, as we are having to make massive cuts our ability to do that will be limited. \"The government is already taking the axe to our school sports funding. We fear the coalition's cuts may have jeopardised the Olympic legacy. I'm shocked at the extent of their callousness.

in east London.\n\nVisitors will be able to climb on the \u00a322m structure to get panoramic views across London's skyline.\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company aims to appoint an operator by June 2011 with the contract running for ten years.\n\nInterested parties have until 28 January to make a formal bid.\n\nThe winning bidder will be in charge of ticketing, marketing and events, hospitality and catering, the gift shop, reception and internal security at the sculpture.\n\nThe Orbit, incorporating the five Olympic rings in a lattice of steel, is expected to be built by March 2012.\n\nVisitors will be able to go up the structure in a lift and will have the option of walking down the spiralling staircase\n\n'Must-see attraction'\n\nThe tower is expected to attract a million visitors to the

of the world's most spectacular visitor attractions.\n\n\"Combining cutting-edge design with stunning views of the London skyline, the sculpture could attract up to one million visitors in its first year of operation, and will be an iconic symbol of future Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\n\"With the changing view of the city by day and night, the ArcelorMittal Orbit has the potential to be the must-see attraction in east London.\"\n\nArcelorMittal will provide \u00a319.2m towards the cost of building the Orbit, with the remaining \u00a33.1m being funded by London Development Agency.",

There, on the concourse, is the first official London 2012 Olympic Store, for all your souvenir t-shirt, baseball cap, mug and mascot needs.\n\nAnyone who has been lucky enough to go to an Olympic Games will know exactly how the siren call of the Olympic Store works.\n\nAt first, you walk serenely past, untempted by the range of branded leisurewear and collectibles. By the end of week one, you might have fingered the odd t-shirt and considered whether your mum might like a tasteful porcelain breakfast set.\n\nAs the closing ceremony approaches, you are in a state of panic, grabbing armfuls of cuddly mascots and key rings from the rapidly emptying shelves, even (in extreme cases) contemplating buying the CD of the official Olympic song, which you had so derided during the opening ceremony.\n\nMy booty from my Olympic reporting career looks like this; a collection of pins from Barcelona 92 and Lillehammer 94; framed posters from Atlanta 96 and Sydney 2000 (hanging in the hall at home); similar posters from Athens 2004, Beijing 2008 and Vancouver 2010 (still in their cardboard tubes waiting to be framed); and a motley collection of cuddly stuffed mascot toys from Athens, Beijing and Vancouver, gathering dust in forgotten corners of my daughters' bedrooms.\n\nI have been rather hoping that the souvenirs they will get from London 2012 will prove a little more durable.\n\nSince London won the bid on that memorable day in July 2005, there has been much talk of the Olympic legacy. Part of that, of course, is making sure that the venues and stadia being built for the Games will be put to good use afterwards and that we're not left with a herd of white elephants, as previous hosts have been.\n\nBut another part is ensuring that our children are inspired to make sport part of their lives, for the rest of their lives. Not every girl is going to have the talent and dedication to be the next Rebecca Adlington or Jessica Ennis, but if she wants to be able to go and swim or run, she should be able to find somewhere to do it, and someone to teach her.\n\nBut how do we deliver that legacy? At the moment, no-one seems entirely sure. It seems logical to assume schools should play a central part in helping our children to get active.\n\nWhen Education Secretary Michael Gove announced last autumn he was scrapping ring-fenced funding for School Sports Partnerships (SSPs), the howls of protest were deafening.\n\nThe 450 partnerships allow schools across the country to combine resources to provide a wide range of sporting activities, in PE lessons and after school clubs, for secondary, primary and special school pupils.\n\nSport has always been a key ingredient in school life. Photo: Getty\n\nThey have helped to deliver the last government's promised minimum of two hours PE per week to more than 90% of students.\n\nIt is all very different to how things were in my day - thank goodness.\n\nBack at my secondary school, if you did not like - and, crucially, were not much good at - hockey and netball in the winter or tennis and athletics in the summer, you did everything you could to drop out. No-one tried that hard to stop you either. I did exactly that, regretting my move ever since.\n\nNow, it is not an option to be a school sports refusenik.\n\nThis week, for 5 live Sport, I am visiting a school in Worcestershire to find out how a thriving SSP actually works.\n\nCaroline Siddell was named PE teacher of the year in 2009 by the Sunday Times newspaper. She is passionate about finding a sport for every student.\n\nSouth Bromsgrove High offers the usual range of team games - rugby, football, netball, lacrosse among others - but also roller hockey, cheerleading and ultimate frisbee.\n\nShe has about 100 pupils in her cheerleading class, which operates every lunchtime. Traditionalists might throw up their hands in horror but there are also opportunities to compete against other schools in the Partnership in team sports like basketball, rugby or football - provided you make the team, which I never did.\n\nSiddell reckons that perhaps 50 out of 1,500 pupils will regularly participate in competitive team sports - but there are enough other options to make sure that even those seriously challenged in the ball skills department find something to do.\n\nClearly something good has happened in our school PE departments since I left. And the outcry created by the threat to disband the SSPs was a clear indication of how highly they are valued.\n\nStudent Debbie Foote, 17, from Lincolnshire took a petition to Downing Street, signed by more than half a million students, parents and teachers, while more than 70 Olympians and Paralympians, including Olympic champions Darren Campbell and Denise Lewis, signed a letter to the Prime Minister, organised by badminton silver medallist Gail Emms.\n\nAnd in December, the Department for Education announced that the SSP programme will continue unchanged until the end of this school year, then on a reduced scale until the summer of 2013.\n\nA partial triumph, then, for the protestors.\n\nEmms will be part of our distinguished panel at South Bromsgrove this week as we discuss the importance of school sport, with only 18 months to go before London 2012.\n\nWe will be joined by an audience of students, teachers, parents and representatives of local sports groups to focus on how the Olympic legacy can still be delivered to our children, in a climate of nationwide financial restraint.\n\nYou will be able to hear our debate in 5 live Sport on Thursday from 2000 GMT. You can have your say on the telephones after 2100 GMT.", "images": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/ec2eba38ef5c538c472b483137edc1f18dfa607e.gif", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a8e42f8fe987b7cc9bf2d43b74b2c74b2448d2e3.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/28931f3ccafc2f644e39fcd31a5bea8d62683ae9.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/6313e62a463c4b1692d050dc6b468f6742dc6d20.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2e00d1d53e9c3bd91993196aa19a1d88589969f0.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/ca2543abe47b1229f96633c5d10be904ab15b592.png"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "19/01/2011"}, "rank_265": {"title": "Athletics boss Diack slams Olympic stadium plans", "text": "Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement The head of world athletics says London will have told a \"big lie\" to get the 2012 Olympics if the Olympic stadium is converted into a football ground. West Ham and Tottenham both want to move to the venue after 2012 but under Spurs' plans the track will go. \"They'll have made a big lie during their presentation,\" International Athletics Association Federation chief Lamine Diack told BBC Sport. \"There will be no credibility... of a great country like Britain.\" And Diack, a member of the International Olympic Committee, suggested that if the athletics track was scrapped Britain's chances of hosting future events would be severely compromised. \"[There would be] no way to comeback as far as my generation is concerned,\" he stated. \"You can consider you are dead. You are finished. DAVID BOND BLOG Are Diack's remarks potentially embarrassing for those who made those promises? Yes. Do they matter for Britain's credibility? Yes again\n\n\"This nation has a number of heroes in athletics. I could spend an hour, listing one by one all those who've achieved fantastic things in athletics. They are still there, involved. And this country, this city saying that I'm not able to have a stadium of athletics?\" Tottenham and West Ham will make their final submissions to the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) on Friday. The OPLC, which can ask either club to provide more details of their proposals, has a board meeting on Friday, 28 January when it is expected to decide on its preferred bidder. Its recommendation then has to be ratified by two government departments - the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and the Department of Communities and Local Government - and the London Mayor's office, with a decision expected by the end of March. Architect's guide to the London 2012 Olympic Stadium design West Ham have pledged to retain the running track while Spurs intend to rebuild the stadium without the track. In an effort to counteract any charge that the Stratford venue would lack the intimacy of football grounds that do not have running tracks, West Ham stated: \"There are seats at Wembley stadium (regarded as having great views from every vantage point) which are further away from the pitch than any seat in our proposed stadium.\" Labour's former Olympic minister Tessa Jowell has suggested that having a football club as the main tenant of the stadium would not be ideal, though her desire to see the track retained has seen her favour the West Ham bid. \"Newham Council, together with West Ham, commits to keep the athletics track, commits to external community involvement and is apparently commercially viable with partners Essex County Cricket Club and [entertainment provider] Live Nation,\" she said. Fans need to understand that the first priority was to keep home where it is, but if it's financially unviable, what do you do?\n\nFormer Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar \"Therefore, they meet the five tests that we applied for the legacy use of the stadium, to the commitments we made in the bid book and the heavy commitment to community engagement.\" When asked how it would reflect on the bid, and Britain as a whole, if the athletics legacy was not kept at the stadium, Jowell simply said: \"Badly. \"I had to pull Britain out of hosting the athletics World Championships in 2005 because we didn't have a suitable stadium and we couldn't afford to build a stadium in time. \"When we set about bidding for the Olympics, at the very heart of that was putting that right and making amends by saying part of our legacy will be a world-class stadium that can host world-class athletics events. \"When we made that commitment in the bid book they were carefully considered commitments that were in the interests of sport in this country. \"They were also persuasive in winning the bid for London 2012 so they can't be taken or set aside lightly.\" West Ham's proposal of retaining the running track but reducing the capacity of the stadium from 80,000 to 60,000, which had looked a more legacy-friendly option, came in for heavy criticism on Wednesday. Both Simon Clegg, the former British Olympic Association chief executive, and Michael Cunnah, Wembley Stadium's former chief executive, believe football and athletics cannot both be held successfully in the same stadium. \"It is quite obvious that the only viable model for the stadium is to have a football club as an anchor tenant, but football fans in this country want to be as close to the action as possible,\" said Clegg. \"I articulated this to Sebastian Coe a couple of years ago but the issue has become even more acute for me since I have been involved in a club. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. \"The entire bid was based on the principle of sustainable legacy and not creating white elephants and only 17 months out from the Games we have still not resolved the thorny issue of future of the stadium. \"It's madness to suggest we should keep a track just on the basis we may get an athletics world championships or European championships say once every 15 -20 years.\" Former Tottenham chairman Lord Sugar told BBC Five Live that he understood why the issue of a possible move was hard for some fans to face up to, but they needed to think about the long-term security of the club. \"I can understand their hesitance, we're great traditionalists but I think what we have to consider is that we have to do the right thing for the future of the football club, to go to the next level,\" he said. \"To try and do that in Harringey is starting to look financially prohibitive. \"We don't have planning consent [to redevelop White Hart Lane], we have it with lots of caveats, and when you add up the cost of trying to comply with all of them, you see an unviable financial proposition. \"It's not a simple exercise. Fans need to understand that the first priority was to keep home where it is, but if it's financially unviable, what do you do?\". Former BOA boss Clegg prefers Tottenham's bid, but believes that rather than offering to redevelop the National Sports Centre at Crystal Palace as part of their plan for moving into the Olympic Stadium, Spurs should be focused on providing a sustainable athletics legacy in east London. A group of former British Olympians, including double gold medallists Dame Kelly Holmes and Daley Thompson, are against the north London club's proposal to get rid of the track, writing in an open letter: \"We urge the decision makers to ensure the track remains post 2012.\" UK Athletics head coach Charles van Commenee also warned: \"If London doesn't have a stadium where we can organise major championships in athletics, that puts you in a category in Europe that I can't even think of.\"\n\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

Photo: AP\n\nAll of this explains why Baroness Ford, chairman of the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC), the body which must now choose between West Ham and Tottenham, realised there was no financially sustainable legacy for the venue without a Premier League club on board.\n\n\n\nOn Friday both clubs and their respective partners submit their final offers to the OPLC. Baroness Ford and her team, headed by American chief executive Andrew Altman, will then spend the weekend going through the fine print before deciding on Monday whether they have all the information they need to make a decision on a preferred bidder next Friday.\n\nThe extremely strong comments from the head of world athletics, Lamine Diack, in my interview with him on Thursday will only have increased the pressure on the decision-makers.\n\n\n\nWhatever they decide must then be rubber-stamped by their own board before being signed off by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and the Government - represented by two ministers, Sports Minister Hugh Robertson and Bob Neill, a junior minister in the department for communities and local government.\n\n\n\nIf the OPLC doesn't have enough information, or its auditors Price Waterhouse Coopers have any more questions, then they may put the decision off for another week.\n\n\n\nBefore then, expect a step up in the already intense lobbying campaign by both sides.\n\n\n\nOn Friday morning, Sir Keith Mills, the deputy chairman of London 2012 (a body which has absolutely no direct role in the decision on the stadium's future) and director of Tottenham, went on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme to put Spurs' case.\n\n\n\nIt is the first time he has done so and his message was clear: Tottenham - and not West Ham - offer the only option which will guarantee the stadium doesn't add to the already high public cost of the Olympics.\n\n\n\nMills made the point - highlighted by the image above - that the original legacy plan was not going to work. And he reiterated Tottenham's argument that football and athletics don't mix.\n\n\n\nWest Ham, of course, deny all this - along with criticisms of the sight lines for football in the Olympic stadium and claims that their numbers don't stack up. To try and prove the point, their \u00a340m loan from joint bid partners Newham Council was approved at a meeting on Thursday night and they will on Friday announce a partnership with Westfield, who will be the consortium's design, construction and major development partners.\n\n\n\nAs I said in my previous blog, all this noise is unlikely to make a jot of difference to the OPLC and Baroness Ford who must make their decision based not only on community and multi-sport legacy plans but also on hard, cold economic reality.\n\n\n\nThe \u00a35m annual running costs of the stadium need to be paid by someone other than the taxpayer. As you can see, the original plan, contained in the Singapore promise, really wasn't an option.\n\nUpdate 1845 GMT\n\nAlthough the key details of the West Ham and Tottenham bids handed to the OPLC are being kept secret, I have been told about a key part of the Spurs proposal which they hope will swing the decision in their favour.\n\n\n\nIn addition to offering to pay a rental income in return for the 250-year lease, Tottenham and their partner, the American entertainment giant AEG, are offering to redevelop land and facilities around the stadium.\n\n\n\nSpurs hope this will be attractive to the OPLC for two reasons.\n\n\n\nThe first is that by building new sports and entertainment facilities around the main stadium it will bring the rest of the Olympic Park alive after the Games. The OPLC is known to be concerned about the stadium becoming an isolated visitor attraction in an otherwise under-used park.\n\n\n\nThe difficulties associated with delivering a legacy for the whole park after 2012 is perhaps illustrated best by the problems with the \u00a3265m aquatics centre.\n\n\n\nAlthough OPLC chairman Baroness Ford is confident she can find a solution, the elaborate roof design limits her options. Plans to turn the aquatics centre into an indoor water park for the community with slides, restaurants and cafes had to be scrapped because the curved roof designed by Zaha Hadid takes up too much space.\n\n\n\nNow, Spurs are not for one moment offering to take over the aquatics centre - in the end the OPLC will convert it before finding a management partner to run it (probably British Swimming and Newham Council). But the aquatics centre illustrates the point that the OPLC has to think about the wider interests of the Olympic Park - not just the stadium.\n\n\n\nTottenham chairman Daniel Levy unquestionably had this in mind in the open letter he published today - emphasising plans for \"an exceptional public realm which would host community-focused events and activities\".\n\n\n\nHe goes on: \"Our plans also include a major tourist attraction based around extreme sports and incorporating specialist sports retailing, restaurants, cafes and bars.\"\n\n\n\nThe second reason why Tottenham believe their offer to develop other facilities and attractions around the stadium is significant is because they will share any profits from those ventures with the OPLC, guaranteeing extra revenue which could eventually be used to pay back part of the \u00a3500m cost of the stadium.\n\n\n\nWest Ham and Newham Council are, of course, offering something similar. They say the stadium will be a genuinely multi-sport and entertainment venue used 365 days of the year. They, too, will pay a rent for the 250-year lease plus a share of revenue from events.\n\n\n\nBut Tottenham hope their plan - and ability to invest in the rest of the site - could be persuasive.\n\n", "images": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a8e42f8fe987b7cc9bf2d43b74b2c74b2448d2e3.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/ec966e0fadc4271032903c8db5e39598fb951736.gif", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/1d7afdf174f9870483e57e1225be5405f805d313.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/bb6bdeccf20847e32d015a6659b010464a4bf035.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2e00d1d53e9c3bd91993196aa19a1d88589969f0.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/cd7d13097065ffbf5efa9b92e0f6258333771be7.gif", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/1b639c913f3935bd32b4912f3d4c6283fe485e0a.jpg"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "21/01/2011"}, "rank_256": {"title": "2010 Olympics legacy confusion for London stadium", "text": "What legacy from the London Olympics\n\nEast London's Olympic Stadium could end up being flattened when the games are over, as plans for athletics coverage after the 2012 games have led to confusion and rival plans.", "images": ["https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/51133000/jpg/_51133793_jex_949190_de27-1.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/media/images/51129000/jpg/_51129710_jex_949151_de27-1.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=politics::news.politics.media_asset.12381901.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:b5c53246-9969-e059-e040-850a02846523]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-media-asset]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/51129000/jpg/_51129710_jex_949151_de27-1.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1", "date": "07/02/2011"}, "rank_141": {"title": "West Ham beat Tottenham to win Olympic stadium backing", "text": "Olympics correspondent, BBC London\n\nWest Ham have won the backing of Olympic bosses in the battle for the 2012 stadium, BBC London has learned.\n\nOlympic Park Legacy Company executives have decided the offer from the club - which would retain the athletics track - is better than Tottenham's rival bid.\n\nThey are expected to ask the company's board to announce West Ham as the preferred bidder on Friday.\n\nThe government and London's mayor will take a final decision but are expected to back the OPLC's recommendation.\n\nAn OPLC spokesman said: \"It is pure speculation to say that a decision has been made.\n\n\"Our board meets on Friday. There will be presentations by OPLC officers of both bids and a vote to recommend a preferred bidder.\"\n\nIt would be a surprise if ministers and the mayor, Boris Johnson, overturn the recommendation of OPLC executives, who have spent the last few months discussing the various plans with both clubs in detail, when they reveal their decision in the coming weeks.\n\nReacting to the decision, Olympian javelin thrower Steve Backley said: \"West Ham was the only real option.\n\n\"It was the only really viable bid that satisfied all the criteria.\n\n\"The Tottenham bid would have involved removing the running track which just wasn't an option.\"\n\nBut Lord Sugar, former chairman of Spurs, said: \"It's totally flawed - it will be a white elephant.\n\n\"It will be a disaster for the taxpayer and we'll end up having a mothballed Olympic village.\n\n\"The Tottenham proposal is for an iconic anchor centrepiece.\"\n\nWest Ham are happy for the athletics track to be kept in the stadium and for the venue to be used for a variety of sports and concerts.\n\nTottenham's plans were to dismantle the stadium in Stratford and build a new football ground in its place.\n\nThe Spurs proposal has faced huge criticism from the athletics world, MPs and the public.\n\nA recent BBC London poll suggested 81% of Londoners were against the proposals to rip up the athletics track.\n\nThe ComRes phone poll, carried out between 21 and 23 January, also suggested 72% of people in London wanted West Ham to get the stadium, with only 13% supporting Tottenham.\n\nMinisters and the mayor are understood to be well aware that the Tottenham option would have been a \"hard sell\" to taxpayers.\n\nLabour MP for Tottenham David Lammy told the BBC: \"I haven't heard anything official but if this is right I think it is obviously the right decision.\n\n\"Their (West Ham's) bid in the end was for all London - and Londoners will be paying for this until 2017. Spurs' bid was for just one club.\n\n\"I hope we can get back to the White Hart Lane development which got planning permission just three months ago, for a brand new stadium with a capacity up to 56,000.\"\n\nA selection of your comments in reaction to the recommendation\n\nI'm a West Ham fan and obviously pleased with the OPLC's backing. It seems logical in view of the Spurs bid to knock down a brand new stadium and then eliminate themselves by moving the Olympic legacy, promised when we won the Games, to Crystal Palace which has a running track already. It's not ideal having a gap between fans and the pitch but that's the price of a new 60,000-seater, which could be the envy of the entire Championship next year! Hamish Green, Chingford, London\n\nIt's about time West Ham were backed in this. It is obvious to everyone that the Tottenham bid was flawed and totally contrary to everything that London wanted. Tottenham seemed to think they could decide who got it and even tried to stitch it up with 'celebrities' backing their proposal. This is a good step forward for West Ham United and British athletics. Lee Wyatt, Tunbridge Wells, Kent\n\nI support neither West Ham nor Spurs but I am an athletics fan. It would have been shameful for Britain and its Olympic legacy had Spurs won this bid. Britain can now look forward to staging a fantastic Olympic Games and world class athletics for many years to come. Paul Barter, Chudleigh, Devon\n\nAs a steward for West Ham, I am concerned about the extra time it will take to drive to the stadium when we move. Also the surrounding area's parking is horrendous and I wouldn't want to risk a parking fine. I doubt all staff would be given a free parking space and I would not want to pay to park in the multi-story car park at the stadium at probably a large daily price. Jackie, Barking\n\nI have been going to West Ham since the early 70s. It is truly a special atmosphere with not only the pitch enclosed but the stadium enclosed in the east end. It has lost a bit with the recent developments and the wider areas around the pitch. To go to an athletics stadium would be a disaster. I have been to grounds with tracks and it is awful. I have not met a West Ham fan who wants to move. I also believe the facilities and parts of the design are not conducive for football crowds. What I cannot understand is the short-sightedness of the design at how it would be used. It does not take a genius to work out that a pure athletics arena is not commercially viable. Geoff White, Chelmsford, Essex\n\nTottenham now may have to enter serious negotiations with the FA and revisit the contracts surrounding Wembley. Their stadium issue must be sorted asap and the White Hart Lane development is unaffordable. Ian, Herts\n\nAs a Tottenham fan, I am concerned that the club needs a better and larger home than at present, but I believe the West Ham bid to be the right approach. However, I have serious worries about its commercial viability. There will have to be further proposals to convince me. I know club sharing is anathema to many fans, but to work, the venue must be used continuously. Andrew Wright, Stroud, Gloucestershire\n\nUpton Park has arguably the best stadium atmosphere in England. This is partly due to the incredible support of the fans through thick and thin, but it is also because of the very close and intimidating style of the stadium. West Ham will lose a strong weapon if they move to a stadium where a running track separates the fans from the pitch. For two businessmen who market themselves as supporters of the club, I would have expected them to canvas the opinion of real fans. My opinion, one which is shared by a large number of Hammers, is that we should stay at Upton Park, and if necessary, the prehistoric East Stand should be renovated and expanded. Daniel Graham, Portsmouth\n\nIt's a dreadful decision. It would have been a dreadful decision had Spurs got it as well, and threatens to drive my club, Leyton Orient, out of London or even out of business. That's the legacy. The screamingly obvious fact is that this stadium is not suitable for football. The whole process has been an unaccountable farce from start to finish. Tom Davies, Walthamstow, London\n\nIt would be a disgrace to rip up the running track, so my vote goes to the West Ham proposal. Peter Guarino, Jersey\n\nShame it didn't go to Spurs as the stadium was always designed to be partly dismantled after the Olympics anyway. I can understand West Ham wanting to keep the running track. The further you are away from the Hammers, the better they look. Tricksy, London\n\nWell at least common sense has prevailed. Surely having spent so much money on a wonderful stadium and used taxpayers' money, were they really going to allow Spurs to come in knock it down and rebuild a brand new stadium. It's ridiculous to even think they had any justification for putting such an idiotic idea forward.

caption The aquatics centre's design has been praised but critics fear it will not serve its post-Games purpose\n\nThe world will be watching when London hosts the Olympics next year, but once 2012 has passed will the Games have delivered the legacy promised by the organisers?\n\nThe construction phase\u200e of London's 2012 Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, is now all but complete.\n\nThe signature sweeping roofs of the velodrome and the aquatics centre and the imposing mass of the 80,000-seater stadium form the centrepieces of complex Olympics site which is, say ministers and administrators, \"on time and on budget\".\n\nAs landscape workers move on to the park to soften the concrete and glass with avenues of London plane trees, Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson is keen to point out the scale of the achievement.\n\n\"We were trying to build two Terminal 5s in half the time [it took], and mount a logistical operation, the size of which has never been attempted by this country outside a major world war,\" he says.\n\n\"It has already delivered the largest new urban park anywhere in Europe, half-a-billion pound transport upgrades to London; it's brought in its wake \u00a31bn investment from Westfield, the largest new shopping centre anywhere in Europe.

When that was judged economically uncertain, bids were invited from football clubs.\n\nWest Ham emerged as the preferred bidder but the decision was challenged by both Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient.\n\nWith the legacy of London's Olympic stadium heading for the law courts, the government decided to intervene, says the Olympics minister.\n\n\"The whole process was getting bogged down in legal paralysis, so we took the decision in government to cut right though this, and we will retain now the stadium in public ownership and do a simple lease to whichever one comes out of the process,\" he says.\n\nLondon 2012 - Begin your journey here London 2012: Latest Olympic news, sport, features and programmes from the BBC\n\nThe decision could leave taxpayers to cover stadium running costs after the Games and with an extra \u00a320m bill towards its conversion for football use, according to the London Mayor's Office.\n\nMeanwhile the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) is currently reviewing bids from companies for management of the \u00a3270m aquatics centre once the Olympics and Paralympics have finished.\n\n\"After the Games, these become public pools so anyone can come and swim where our Olympians will have won all their medals,\" says Peter Tudor of the OPLC, which owns the centre.\n\n'Most disappointing' aspect\n\nWhile everyone acknowledges the design qualities of award-winning architect Zaha Hadid's building with its swooping, whale-like roof, some - including the mayor of Newham Sir Robin Wales - believe the design limits its future use:\n\n\"When it was being built we went and said 'why don't we have a leisure pool in there so we'll attract the kids, get them in the leisure pool and get them swimming - and we'll even pay for it'.\n\nFind out more File on 4 is on BBC Radio 4 on 8 November at 20:00 GMT and Sunday 13 November at 17:00 GMT Listen via the Radio 4 website Download the podcast\n\n\"But because of the design of the building, the roof slopes in such a way that you can't get the slides in, so it really wasn't possible to get this leisure pool in, even though we were offering to pay for it.\"\n\nSir Robin says for him this was the \"most disappointing\" aspect of the Olympic legacy.\n\nThe OPLC says that while fixed slides and flumes will not be possible in the aquatics centre, they will use portable, inflatable equipment to attract leisure users to the pools.\n\nHugh Robertson admits there is an argument that a more utilitarian structure could have been built more cheaply.\n\n\"Whether over the long-term the decision to go with the Zaha Hadid design will be the right one remains to be seen,\" he says.\n\n\"But there is an element at least in this of the fact that it is a fantastic facility.

But are they, you know, actually sports?\n\nThe reason I ask is the same reason the venerable \"You and Yours\" programme was asking. With London 2012 now little more than 200 days away, do we, as a nation, have any chance of reaching our Olympic legacy targets for mass participation?\n\nThe short answer to those questions is \"no, they're not and no, we don't\".\n\nThe longer answer, however, is much more complicated and that is what made \"What's Your Sport?\" such an interesting listen.\n\nIs a group activity, such as ballroom dancing, really a sport? Photo: BBC\n\nBefore I get into the meat of the debate I should explain what these targets are all about. Or, more precisely, were all about, as we don't hear about them so much these days.\n\nThe first was a general ambition to make the nation slightly less wedged to the sofa and was supposed to be \"delivered\" by the Department of Health. Doctors and nurses were mobilised to raise the heart rates of Brits of all shapes and sizes for about 30 minutes a week: prevention not cure.\n\nSadly, the most recent data suggests the early progress made from 2007 has run out of puff.\n\nFewer than 15 million people fit into this category and any hope of getting that significantly closer to 16 million by 2013 has vanished. Which is what has happened to this target as government policy: not formally dropped, just not talked about.\n\nThat is beginning to look like the fate of the other target too, the ambitious goal of getting one million more people to play a lot more sport.\n\nThis target - set by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) via Sport England, the agency in charge of \"sport for all\" - was always going to be trickier as it entails a serious commitment for most in terms of time and money, three sessions a week.\n\nLike the first target, early momentum here is tailing off. What is more worrying is that the numbers for teenagers and women are falling.\n\nThere are now about seven million people who play enough sport to meet the criteria, way off the 7.8 million hoped for by this time next year.\n\nTaken together, these two measures of participation add up to nearly 22 million people, aged 16 and older, playing weekly sport. That's 35% of the population.\n\nPut that like, it does not sound so bad, does it? After all, \"sport for all\" is fine for those who like sport but terrifying for those with memories of frostbitten cross-country runs and the humiliation of being picked last.\n\nBut those numbers do not sound so good when you hear that half the population are not doing much exercise at all and nearly three million Brits have diabetes. That last number is up by almost 50% in four years and the vast majority suffer from Type 2 diabetes, which develops in the very overweight. On this trend, there will be 5.45 million cases by 2030.\n\nAnd it's not just the health time bomb we should be worried about.\n\nSport, whether you liked it at school or not, can do things other social policy tools cannot. Keeping boys interested in their lessons, giving girls with body image worries some healthy role models, promoting good relations between community groups and giving the nation some feel-good entertainment - sport can help with all of these.\n\nWhich brings me back to those activities at the top. None of them would have been picked up by Sport England's researchers because they have used a fairly narrow definition of sport ever since former DCMS minister James Purnell told them in 2007 that the clue is in Sport England's title - no pastimes.\n\nThis put the national governing bodies of the respective sports in charge of mass participation. Sport England's role was reduced to dishing out money and collecting results. Those results have been very disappointing but for a handful of sports.\n\nSport does not have to be competitive, but it must be accessible, fun and inclusive. Photo: Reuters\n\nI kept thinking about this as caller after caller told the \"You and Yours\" audience about the exercise they do every week that would not \"count\" as formal sport.\n\nDiana from Norfolk talked about the netball she played for \"giggles with the girls\" until some of them got too serious and wanted to play actual matches.\n\nSomebody else emailed in to say they swim three times a week but \"can't stand sports\", whilst a leisure centre owner in London said she had ripped the squash courts out to create more room for Zumba.\n\nI am not listing these examples to mock them. I list them because they provide clues as to how we can improve our overall fitness and, in the long run, perhaps win more medals too.\n\nSport does not have to be competitive. It does not need pitch markings. It does not even need to be that organised. But it does need to be accessible, fun and inclusive. That means being more attractive to women, the young and the old, being affordable and easier to fit around busy lives.\n\nStaging great sport in this country in the hope that people will be inspired to start doing it themselves is not a dreadful idea provided it is not the only idea. We also need to open up our best facilities - often in private ownership - for greater public use and we need to encourage more people to take up coaching without charging them an arm and a leg to get qualified.\n\nBut most of all we have to stop turning people off sport. If somebody wants to get fitter, what is wrong with ballroom dancing? That could get the competitive juices flowing again and lead to a more sporty activity next. Or the buzz of exercising again could tempt them to add some badminton to their weekly routine.\n\nThat is the funny thing about exercise: it can be difficult to encourage if you get bogged down in detail but can pop up in the strangest places if you create the right environment.\n\nA good example of this is table tennis, one of the few \"regular\" sports doing well participation-wise.\n\nIt has made a virtue out of a vice in that inner-city schools with no outside space can put half a dozen tables in the dining hall and get a PE lesson going. Put those tables in shopping malls or train stations and you take your sport to the people. Get a coach there with a couple of bats and some balls and you may just spark an Olympic dream.\n\nThere is no magic bullet here and those legacy targets will be missed. But they were worth a shot and the same can be said of foxtrots and polkas and probably Zumba too, although you will never catch me trying it.\n\nAs well as my blogs, you can follow me when I'm out and about at https://twitter.com/mattslaterbbc", "images": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a8e42f8fe987b7cc9bf2d43b74b2c74b2448d2e3.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/7e17d4f9668e37632fda9c1bf7a158093dd16f1b.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/db75653deb7fae3a9d22dfe878e397a8c2812cf3.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2e00d1d53e9c3bd91993196aa19a1d88589969f0.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/9b409b4e410315d56efbca26418cb7aa88b55366.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/ae5ed26f5d7e2929d4f63fdf10683998e17088a4.jpg"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "04/01/2012"}, "rank_252": {"title": "Will the promised Olympic legacy be delivered?", "text": "Please turn on JavaScript.

from five to four - had guaranteed them an extra \u00a3180m over the next five-year funding cycle.\n\nThe \u00a3450m allocated to sports governing bodies from 2013-17 is exactly the same amount as that given to them between 2009-13.\n\nThere is an extra \u00a3160m for improving and building new sports facilities. And there is more money for the School Games programme backed up by a \u00a310m sponsorship from Sainsbury's.\n\nBut apart from the Sainsbury's money, all of this was budgeted for.\n\nWith so much pressure on the public finances it is hardly surprising that there is no new money being thrown at sport. In some ways, it is remarkable that sport has been able to hold on to what it has.\n\nWill the London Olympics inspire young people to take up sport? Photo - PA\n\nWhat is different, according to the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, is the refocusing of the available resources - away from adults (a group which has seen an increase in participation since London won the right to stage the Games in 2005) towards teenagers and young people.\n\nHere the statistics have been appalling. Since 2005 there has been a 2% drop among 16-19 year-olds, with a 100,000 decline in the last year alone.\n\nTo arrest that slide, Hunt wants Sport England and the governing bodies to focus their efforts and cash on getting youngsters who play sport at school and college to keep the habit after they leave formal education.\n\nMore money aimed at opening up school and college facilities to local clubs will help if the new programme can be made to work.\n\nWithholding money from sports governing bodies unless they deliver on targets for getting young people to particpate in those sports will also help concentrate minds.\n\nBut so much of this is about changing cultural and social behaviour among young people. That is a far wider social issue and it starts in schools.\n\nThe problem, critics argue, is that last year's controversial decision to slash funding for school sports co-ordinators could do even greater damage to the legacy vision than the problem in youth sport which the government is now trying to address.\n\nThen there is the difficulty of measuring the country's sporting habits.\n\nThe exisiting Active People survey is deeply flawed.

host a two-day cycling festival next year, which will become an annual event, as part of the Olympic legacy, mayor Boris Johnson has said.\n\nIt will be the first large-scale event to make use of the Olympic Park in east London after it reopens next summer.\n\nDay one will involve a family ride on traffic-free roads in central London.\n\nAmateur and professional cyclists will tackle a 100-mile route, starting in the Olympic Park and based on the 2012 Games cycle road race, the next day.\n\nMr Johnson is due to make a speech to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos later when he will describe his ambition to create one of the world's leading cycling events in the capital in August 2013.\n\nCycling heritage\n\nTalking about the festival, he said: \"This spectacular event will help ensure the 2012 Games are just the start, not the end, of the benefits of hosting the Olympics.\n\n\"We are already creating long-lasting opportunities for the park and the capital which will showcase London to the world, attract more visitors, create more jobs and support the economy.\"\n\nImage caption Cycling World Champion Mark Cavendish has endorsed the event\n\nThe first day of the festival will be aimed at all ages and abilities and designed to promote the fun of cycling in London.\n\nIt is hoped up to 70,000 people will cycle on an eight-mile (13km) traffic-free loop taking in the capital's iconic roads and landmarks.\n\nOn the second day organisers expect up to 35,000 amateur, club and world class elite cyclists to race a 100-mile (161km) challenge course.\n\nIt will be largely based on the route of the 2012 Games cycle road race, incorporating the Surrey countryside, and finish at an iconic location in central London.\n\nMark Cavendish, current cycling world champion, said: \"This is the ideal legacy not only for our world-class team of cyclists and paracyclists, but also for thousands of amateur cyclists who will hopefully be inspired by our performance at the Olympic Games.\n\n\"This event will be a fantastic opportunity to show Britain at its best and to share our Olympic cycling heritage.\"\n\n'Beautiful parkland'\n\nThe mayor's office said the international promotion associated with what will become an annual cycling festival would bring millions of pounds of economic benefit into London through national and international participation, spectators and worldwide TV audiences.\n\nIt is hoped it will provide a long-term source of income for improving conditions for cycling in London and provide opportunities for other cycling initiatives.\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) has also now confirmed that the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will open in phases from July 2013 to allow people back into the park as soon as possible after work is completed to return it to public use.\n\nAs part of the cycling festival it will organise a weekend of \"wheel-based activities\" on the park with the aim of bringing local communities together through competitions, workshops, music, food and film.\n\nMargaret Ford, chairwoman of the OPLC, said: \"The London Cycling Festival is just the kind of event that fits into the family ethos of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\n\"Thousands of people will get the chance to enjoy our most beautiful parkland in an event that will bring people together and encourage healthy living.\"", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=",

It is now a prerequisite for any potential Olympic host. And it was London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympics which set the precedent. Rewind to that triumphant day back in July 2005 and speeches from Sebastian Coe and his team were littered with references to the 'L' word.\n\nIn a nutshell, Coe promised London would not only regenerate a run-down part of east London but use the 2012 Games to increase sporting activity in Britain and around the world, particularly among the young. He also promised to re-engage the world with the Olympic movement. And he promised none of the costly venues would become white elephants.\n\nIt was a bold vision but proved to be an irresistible argument for the International Olympic Committee, one that ultimately gave London the edge over rivals Paris and Madrid.\n\nBut while much hard work has been done and some considerable progress has been made, legacy has consistently been the one area organisers and ministers have struggled with over the last six-and-a-half years.\n\nTo get a clearer idea of the difficulties with delivering an Olympic legacy, I am producing a series of films and radio reports on previous hosts, starting with the Australian city of Sydney.\n\nThe successful hosts of the 2000 Games, Sydney has been the best template for London's planning. The cultural, economic and sporting parallels are obvious, while the regeneration of Homebush was a clear inspiration for the redevelopment of Stratford.\n\nI travelled to Sydney in January to see, 12 years on, what lessons there might be for London.\n\nIn order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed. Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions. If you're reading via RSS, you'll need to visit the blog to access this content.\n\nAlthough Sydney won its bid for the Olympics at a time when legacy was not as important, organisers hoped the Games would nevertheless bring lasting benefits afterwards.\n\nThe physical legacy of the Games at Homebush - or Sydney Olympic Park, as it is now known - is clear.\n\nThe main stadium was reduced from 110,000 seats to 80,000 following the Games and, tellingly perhaps, the running track was removed. It has proved to be a shrewd move as the privately-run enterprise, known as the ANZ Stadium, now hosts 50 different events a year, mostly field sports.\n\nWhile I was in Sydney, I saw the first international cricket match to be played at the ANZ Stadium, between Australia and India. It was a rainy night but the game still attracted 60,000 people.\n\nDaryl Kerry, the venue's chief executive, told me if there was one thing London should take from Sydney's experience it is that decisions cannot be taken to satisfy the needs of a two-week event. They have to be made for the long-term benefit of the city and country, something the Olympic Park Legacy Company will no doubt be reflecting again as they await another round of bids for the main stadium next week.\n\nElsewhere around the Sydney complex, the picture is more mixed.\n\nThe aquatics centre was always designed as a community facility. The main 50m pool was retained for schools, clubs and elite swimmers, but there is also a second leisure pool and water fun park. Since it opened in 1997, 17m people have used the facility, which covers its costs.\n\nHowever, the park, which also houses a national showground, an indoor sports and concert arena and a smaller athletics stadium with a capacity of 5,000, needs a public subsidy of more than \u00a335m a year.\n\nThe New South Wales government insists it is worth it. But it was not until 2006 that Sydney developed a proper legacy strategy for the park. It now has clear plans for 2030, with residential and business developments already under way. After a stuttering start, it appears the site is now moving in the right direction.\n\nBut in other areas the experience has not been so successful.\n\nOn tourism, for example, the Games were supposed to drive a boom in visitor numbers. Instead, they actually declined.\n\nIn fairness, the terrorist attacks on New York in 2001 and the SARS outbreak had a negative impact. But tourism officials I spoke to insist that Australia also failed to capitalise on the feelgood factor the Games delivered.\n\nSome, like Andrew McEvoy, the head of Tourism Australia, say that instead of investing in worldwide marketing campaigns to drive home the message, Sydney sat back and expected the world to come.\n\nOnly now are the figures increasing from 2000 levels, thanks mainly to an increase in visitors from China, a sign that Australia's economy is moving closer to Asia and away from Europe and America.\n\nJeremy Hunt, the culture secretary and cabinet minister responsible for the London Olympics, will this week launch a new domestic campaign to use the Games to encourage people to explore the United Kingdom as a holiday destination.\n\nAgencies Visit Britain and Visit England insist \u00a32.48bn will be generated for the tourism industry by the Olympics. Others are more sceptical, arguing the Games will actually deter people from visiting London.\n\nIn participation terms, too, the picture is bleak. Australia has an image as a sports-mad country. Yet academics say the idea that hosting the Olympics led to an increase in people getting fit or playing sport is a \"myth\". Surprisingly, Australia shares Britain's problems with obesity.\n\nLondon organisers and government ministers say they are aware of the problems experienced in Sydney, still the most memorable Olympics of the last two decades. They must be because they promised to deliver even more from the 2012 Games.\n\nDavid Bond's special three-part series on Olympic legacy will appear on BBC1's Six O Clock News, News at Ten and Radio 4's Today programme.", "images": ["https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/a8e42f8fe987b7cc9bf2d43b74b2c74b2448d2e3.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/bb6bdeccf20847e32d015a6659b010464a4bf035.jpg", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/2e00d1d53e9c3bd91993196aa19a1d88589969f0.png", "https://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/cd7d13097065ffbf5efa9b92e0f6258333771be7.gif"], "top_image": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico", "date": "06/03/2012"}, "rank_234": {"title": "London 2012: Olympic security cost raises concern among MPs", "text": "Image caption The Olympic Stadium \"must not become a white elephant\", say MPs\n\nMPs have raised concerns the London 2012 Olympics may go over budget and said it was \"staggering\" initial estimates about security costs were so wrong.\n\nThePublic Accounts Committee's reportalso warned the stadium must not become a white elephant.\n\nThe government insists it is confident the event will come in under budget.\n\nThe Games and legacy projects are expected to cost about \u00a311bn, the report said.\n\nMargaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: \"The venues and infrastructure of the London Olympic Games are on track to be delivered on time and within budget.\n\n\"The Olympic Delivery Authority's management of the building programme has been exemplary.\n\n\"However, the \u00a39.3bn public sector funding package is close to being used up and we are concerned about whether the running of the Games will be held within budget.\n\n\"Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around \u00a311bn.\"\n\n'Weak negotiating position'\n\nMrs Hodge said the committee was \"particularly concerned\" about the significant increases in the security bill.\n\n\"Locog (the London organising committee) now needs more than twice the number of security guards it originally estimated and the costs have roughly doubled.\n\n\"It is staggering that the original estimates were so wrong.\"\n\nThe report states Locog has been forced to renegotiate its contract with G4S for venue security from a \"weak negotiating position\".\n\nMrs Hodge added: \"There is a big question mark over whether it secured a good deal for the taxpayer.\"\n\nLocog's original estimate for the number of security guards in and around the venues was 10,000 - a \"finger in the air estimate\", according to the PAC report.\n\nThe government announced in December that figure had more than doubled to 23,700.\n\nSecurity costs from the Olympics budget have risen from \u00a3282m to \u00a3553m.\n\nThe report said: \"Locog itself now has almost no contingency left to meet further costs, even though it has done well in its revenue generation.\"\n\nOn legacy, the PAC report raises concerns over sports participation targets and the stadium after a deal for West Ham United Football Club to take it over was scrapped.\n\nMost people will look at all this and find it meaningless to quibble over which department is spending what on the Olympics David Bond, BBC Sports Editor What will be the true cost of London 2012?\n\nMrs Hodge added: \"We were promised a strong Olympic legacy but the government has chosen not to adopt the target of one million more people participating in sport by 2013 and plans for the stadium have fallen through.\n\n\"It must not become a white elephant.\n\nLegacy 'unclear'\n\n\"The government is dispersing responsibility for delivering the legacy and we need clarity about who is accountable.\"\n\nThe report states that with only 109,000 new people regularly participating in sport against the original one million target - which the new government chose not to adopt - the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) had got \"poor value for money\" for the \u00a3450m spent through national governing bodies.\n\n\"It is unclear what the sporting participation legacy of the Games is intended to be,\" says the report.\n\nThe DCMS rejected the figure of \u00a311bn of public money being spent on the Games and defended the legacy aims.\n\nA DCMS spokesman said: \"With 140 days to go until the Olympic Games, we are on time and under budget, with over \u00a3500m worth of uncommitted contingency remaining.\n\n\"We are in a strong position and, while we can't be complacent, are confident that we can deliver the Games under budget.\n\n\"As we told the PAC in December we do not recognise the figure of \u00a311bn. We have always been transparent about what is included in the \u00a39.3bn.\n\n\"The cost of purchasing the Olympic Park land will ultimately come back to the public purse through the resale of the land after the Games and was therefore not included.\n\n\"Funding for the legacy programmes, that the PAC refer to, comes from existing business-as-usual budgets and we have been clear about this. These are for projects designed to capitalise on hosting London 2012 but are not an additional Olympic cost.\"\n\nThe DCMS said the legacy included regenerating part of east London and tenants had been secured for six out of eight venues on the Olympic Park.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/58952000/jpg/_58952653_stadium.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=unknown&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:1e7bf348-7d60-c841-91d9-5d6de634a364]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/58952000/jpg/_58952653_stadium.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/58952000/jpg/_58952653_stadium.jpg", "date": "09/03/2012"}, "rank_257": {"title": "The legacy of the Olympics for NI", "text": "Image caption Bangor's new \u00a338m Olympic pool, the first 50m facility in Northern Ireland\n\nIt is half past five in the morning and about 30 teenagers are starting a two-hour training session at Bangor pool.\n\nIt takes a huge commitment from the youngsters, their coaches and parents, who watch intently from the pool side.\n\nElite swimmers in Great Britain and the Republic are training in top notch 50m pools, like Dublin's National Aquatic Centre.\n\nFourteen-year-old Shannon McKimm explains how the Bangor youngsters get a taste of the big time when they head south for competitions.\n\nOne of the demonstrated effects of the Olympic games is that it gets people to participate in sport. I think over the next few years we will see more people getting involved Philip McDonagh, Economist\n\n\"When you go down to the Irish events, they will have a 10-lane 50m pool which is the Olympic standard,\" she said.\n\n\"They have medical centres, they have drug testing rooms, they have basically what you would be looking for Team GB to have - and they get that 24 hours a day.\"\n\nWhen Shannon finishes her morning training, she heads off to school, at nearby Glenlola Collegiate.\n\nFrom her classroom windows, rising above the trees, she can see Bangor's new \u00a338m Olympic pool, the first 50m facility in Northern Ireland.\n\nIt is being developed by North Down Borough Council, with the help of about \u00a315m of funding from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL).\n\nIt was due to open two years ago, but because of difficulties in drawing down government funding, that had to be delayed until this summer.\n\nHowever, an avoidable problem in the building work, when the roof beams were damaged in transport from Austria, has pushed that date back even further and the pool will not open until next February.\n\nSports Minister Caral Ni Chuilin is due to visit the site this week to take part in a naming ceremony.\n\n'Holding to account'\n\nIt is being branded the \"Aurora\", the Latin word for \"dawn\".\n\n\"That pool has had to go through a lot of challenges both seen and unforeseen,\" said Ms Ni Chuilin.\n\n\"They're working flat out and I'm told they're on target. I am keeping a very close eye on it, and if I find out anything different, I'll be holding them to account.\"\n\nThe Aurora is the largest sports project currently under construction in Northern Ireland, employing 200 workers on site.\n\nAnd it is the only piece of infrastructure that can be described as an Olympic legacy.\n\nUntil last year, it was hoped that there would be at least five elite sports centres built around the time of the 2012 Games.\n\nPlans were at an advanced stage for the projects, including a sailing academy at Ballyholme in Bangor and a velodrome in Downpatrick.\n\nBut the executive decided to fund only the Bangor pool, leaving the other sporting organisations frustrated that their plans - which had involved considerable time and money - were being shelved.\n\nInstead, about \u00a3138m was allocated for the upgrade of stadia for the three major sports - football at Windsor Park, rugby at Ravenhill and GAA at Casement Park.\n\nEconomist Philip McDonagh said financial realities in these recessionary times put paid to more ambitious plans to boost the so-called \"minor\" sports.\n\n\"It is disappointing that there won't be more facilities, but the problem is that we would have had to build and pay for them ourselves out of a shrinking Northern Ireland budget. So it would have been nice, but it was going to be at a cost and I'm not sure the cost benefit really justified that investment,\" he said.\n\nSo, apart from the new 50 metre pool in Bangor, is Northern Ireland gaining anything from the Olympics?\n\nThere were hopes of an economic boost for local companies who have been tendering for work on the Olympic venues in London. But there has been limited success in this endeavour.\n\nStepping stone\n\nThe latest available figures from the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) show that by last July it had awarded 1,500 contracts, worth around \u00a35bn.\n\nMost of the successful firms were in the south-east of England.\n\nHere in Northern Ireland, just 43 companies have so far won contracts totalling \u00a340m. That is less than 1% of the total awarded.\n\nOne of the few local firms to secure work at the Olympic village is H & J Martin from Belfast.\n\nThe company has won about \u00a37m worth of business, including the fit out of the media centre.\n\nDivision director Geraldine Gordon said the company had many hurdles to jump in the tendering process.\n\nImage caption Sports Minister Caral Ni Chuilin said she was disappointed more local companies had not won contracts\n\n\"We wanted to grow the business in London generally,\" she said.\n\n\"For us it was seen as the key stepping stone in raising the profile of the company. It took about a year and a half before we had our first success.\"\n\nThe sports minister said she was disappointed that more local companies had not managed to secure contracts from the ODA.\n\n\"We didn't succeed as much as we would have liked to have done,\" said Ms Ni Chuilin.\n\n\"I was talking to people in Scotland and from the north of England and they are all saying the same thing.\n\n\"Why shouldn't we ask why what lessons do we need to learn? We need to know what to do to make the next time better.\"\n\nMr McDonagh supports the minister's view that Northern Ireland will benefit from a long-term Olympic legacy in terms of greater participation in sport - and that can only be good for us.\n\n\"One of the demonstrated effects of the Olympics games is that it gets people to participate in sport. I think over the next few years we will see more people getting involved, and already Sport NI is putting money into trying to encourage people to participate in sport,\" he said.\n\n\"And that's not just a social benefit, it's worthwhile financially and economically as it reduces the burden on our health and social services of looking after people.\"\n\nEnthusiasm for sport should also be boosted by the presence of at least eight Olympic and Paralympic teams who are coming here for pre-games training camps.\n\nThe athletics teams from Qatar, Egypt, Kuwait and Sudan and the Jordanian Paralympic team will train at Antrim Forum during July and August.\n\nThe Chinese gymnasts will be Lisburn and the Australian boxers will be based in Belfast. It is hoped that the Cuban boxers will also sign up for a training camp.\n\nYou can see more on this story on the Sunday Politics at 22.05 GMT on BBC One.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/59152000/jpg/_59152022_bangoraquaticcentre.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=unknown&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:3d3a202f-18fa-a04d-8766-25a356c6139a]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/59152000/jpg/_59152022_bangoraquaticcentre.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/59152000/jpg/_59152022_bangoraquaticcentre.jpg", "date": "18/03/2012"}, "rank_221": {"title": "London 2012: Olympic legacy fund for sports pitches", "text": "Image caption Thirteen projects in the West Midlands will share a \u00a3530,000 Olympic fund to develop sports pitches\n\nA Staffordshire junior football team without a home ground is one of 13 projects in the West Midlands to share a \u00a3530,000 Olympic legacy windfall.\n\nEccleshall Eagles, who currently play across eight rented sites, have been awarded \u00a350,000 from Sport England.\n\nThe Protecting Playing Fields fund aims to bring disused pitches back into use and create new sports fields.\n\nThe money will help the Eagles buy a permanent home, with enough land for three full-sized football pitches.\n\nJeremy Pert, from the club, said: \"We've only been going as a club since 2001.\n\n\"So I think what Sport England could see was that here was a club that was growing and had a desperate need for additional facilities.\"\n\nThe team's new home is expected to be ready for the 2013/14 football season.\n\n\"Not quite in time for Olympic year, but it will certainly be a legacy for the Olympics,\" added Mr Pert.\n\n'Transform pitches'\n\nSport England said it would help to protect all funded playing fields by placing a legal protection on the sites for a minimum of 25 years.\n\n\"These investments will transform the local pitches where many young people have their first experience of sport,\" said Richard Lewis, who chairs Sport England.\n\n\"With all of these playing fields safe from development for at least a generation, communities across the West Midlands can look forward to years of sporting enjoyment.\"\n\nMinister for Sport and the Olympics Hugh Robertson said: \"Protecting and improving playing fields, under Sport England's Protecting Playing Fields fund, is a key part of our 2012 legacy plans.\n\n\"This will enable more people to have more opportunity to play sport, leaving a genuine legacy from hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\"\n\nOther funding offers in the West Midlands region include:\n\n\u00a337,269 to Tamworth Rugby Union Football Club who will use the funding to develop a new training/junior pitch with floodlights.\n\n\u00a350,000 to John Kyrle High School in Herefordshire to level out their uneven rugby/football pitch.

Since 1988, host cities have adopted their own motto.\n\nSo how does London's slogan compare to those of previous Games?\n\n2008: Beijing, China\n\n\"One world, one dream\"\n\nOrganisers said the logo reflected the essence of the Olympic values - unity, friendship, progress, harmony, participation and dreams.\n\nSimple in expression, but profound in meaning, it was also said to reflect the core concepts of the Beijing Olympics - \"green Olympics, high-tech Olympics and people's Olympics\".\n\nIn Chinese, the word \"tongyi\" - or \"the same\" - is used for the English word \"one\". Organisers said this highlighted the idea that \"mankind lives in the same world and seeks for the same dream and ideal\".\n\n2004: Athens, Greece\n\n\"Welcome home\"\n\n2004 marked the first time since 1896 that the Olympics had been held in Greece - the site of their ancient incarnation, which the host country acknowledged with its simple slogan: \"Welcome home\".\n\nThe Games honoured the host nation's history and culture, its proud place in the traditions of the Olympic Movement, and its distinct connection to the Olympic ideals.\n\nFor nearly 12 centuries from 776BC, the ancient Olympic Games were staged on the plains of Olympia.\n\nGames organisers said the celebration came to occupy an important position in the Greek world, embodying a foundation of universal ideals - the values of noble competition and the effort to combine body, will and mind in a balanced whole.\n\n2000: Sydney, Australia\n\n\"Share the spirit\"\n\nAustralia's slogan in 2000 hoped to highlight the inclusive nature of the Games, turning Sydney into a multicultural utopia for the masses.\n\nBut the motto became a hostage to ambush marketing by national airliner Qantas, which started a marketing campaign using the image of Australia's favourite athlete Cathy Freeman with the slogan \"the Spirit of Australia\".\n\nThis prompted Ansett Air, the Games' official airline, to bring legal proceedings that were later settled.\n\n1996: Atlanta, USA\n\n\"The celebration of the century\"\n\nAt Atlanta 1996, home hero Michael Johnson achieved a 200m and 400m double, 35-year-old Carl Lewis picked up his ninth gold in four Games by winning the long jump and Kurt Angle won the wrestling with a broken neck.\n\nThe Olympic flame was movingly lit by Muhammad Ali, and two people died when a lone bomber set off a device in Centennial Olympic Park.\n\nBut these celebratory highlights for the last Games of the 20th Century were overshadowed by the transport debacle at the Games. Athletes got shouted at by officious security officials and were delayed getting to events because bus drivers got lost.\n\n1992: Barcelona, Spain\n\n\"Friends Forever\"\n\nImage caption The spectacular opening ceremony for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics\n\nThe motto of Spain's Olympics in 1992 was encapsulated by the dulcet tones of Sarah Brightman & Jose Carreras in their duet Amigos Para Siempre, sung at the Games' closing ceremony.\n\nAnother anthem used at the Games was Barcelona, composed five years earlier by Freddie Mercury and sung as a duet with Montserrat Caball\u00e9.\n\nIt had been hoped the pair would perform the song at the opening ceremony, but Mercury died before the start of the Games, so a recording of the song was played instead.\n\n1988: Seoul, South Korea\n\n\"Harmony and progress\"\n\nIn picking its slogan for the 1988 Games, South Korea said the creation of a peaceful world - a primary goal of the Olympic Movement - was also the unwavering and historic desire of the Korean people.\n\nOrganisers said they were committed to making the Games a joyful festival in which many cultures of the world could join in harmony with the country's own 5,000-year-old culture.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=unknown&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:a760061a-c8f6-ef43-a2ae-9d3d56c34da7]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/59702000/jpg/_59702932_stadium_overhead_getty.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/59702000/jpg/_59702932_stadium_overhead_getty.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/59702000/jpg/_59702932_stadium_overhead_getty.jpg", "date": "18/04/2012"}, "rank_138": {"title": "London 2012: Suffolk legacy project recruits volunteers", "text": "Image caption Volunteers from the county events team helped out at the Great East Swim at Alton Water, Suffolk\n\nA project inspired by the London Olympics has recruited nearly 250 people to become helpers at sporting and cultural events in Suffolk.\n\nThe Suffolk 2012 Volunteering Legacy Project's aim is to get people to sign up to its County Events Team.\n\nVolunteers are then available for events such as the Great East Swim.\n\nMark McCarthy, project officer, said: \"We're asking if we can get more people inspired and involved in sport and cultural-related volunteering.\"\n\nVolunteers work as stewards and in other behind-the-scenes roles.\n\nDerrick Thomas, 76, is a former cricket and hockey player from Ipswich who was the first to join the project and has volunteered at the swim and at open-air concerts.\n\n'Breaking down barriers'\n\n\"I was always involved in sport, so volunteering keeps me alert and I try to motivate youngsters to get involved in sport,\" he said.\n\n\"It's also a way of breaking down barriers between the different nationalities now living in Suffolk.\n\n\"I have lived in Ipswich for 44 years [he was born in Guyana], and I thought this was a way of giving something back.\n\nMr Thomas will also be taking part in the and will carry the flame between Wickham Market and Woodbridge on 6 July.\n\nMr McCarthy said: \"The 240,000 applications and 70,000 volunteers for the Games themselves has raised the profile of volunteering nationally and it's helped smaller county-based projects like us.\n\n\"One of the things which comes up, such as with our Great East Swim volunteers, is the enjoyment of being involved in such a positive event with such positive people in a pleasant environment.\"\n\nThe project started in 2010 and has funding from Suffolk County Council, Suffolk Sport and Young Suffolk until 2013.", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/59748000/jpg/_59748462_volunteersatgreateastswim.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=suffolk::news.england.suffolk.story.17771048.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:aae956ea-9e4b-3a4a-a542-e2453e47beb1]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/59748000/jpg/_59748462_volunteersatgreateastswim.jpg", "date": "21/04/2012"}, "rank_120": {"title": "Adrian Warner", "text": "Daniel Moylan is the new head of the London Legacy Development Corporation.\n\nBoris Johnson's rushed appointment of a new Olympic legacy chief has shattered the political consensus around the 2012 Games.\n\nBaroness Ford, the chair of the Legacy company which has already been successful in securing a future for most of the Olympic Park, is widely respected across all parties for the calm, but tough way, she has negotiated deals with private and public companies.\n\nFord, a Labour peer who was appointed in 2009 by the previous Labour Government, was expected to stay in control until after the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nBut, fresh from his Mayoral election victory last week, Johnson has appointed Conservative councillor Daniel Moylan as head of the London Legacy Development Corporation.\n\nI understand Ford is very disappointed by the decision which was made public before she or her chief executive Andrew Altman had a chance to inform staff.\n\nShe told me: \"I would loved to have finished the job I started and closed out the deals on the Broadcast Centre and the Stadium.

In a vastly changed global economic landscape, few future hosts will have the money or the will to stage a mega-event on that scale.\n\nEverything about it was supposed to leave you with a sense of awe. From the venues and the ceremonies to the home team's dominance of the medal table, the Games were designed to announce China's arrival as a global superpower.\n\nReturning to Beijing's Olympic Green for my third and final special report on Olympic legacy, it felt as though little had changed over the last four years.\n\nThe Bird's Nest and Water Cube are still decked out in 2008 branding and one can't help feeling that the venues are seen more as monuments to China's big moment in the spotlight than functioning sporting venues.\n\n\n\nBeijing's 'Bird's Nest' Olympic stadium is now only rarely used as a sports arena. Photo: Getty\n\nIn fact more Chinese tourists - five million to be precise - were drawn to the Olympic Stadium in 2011 than to the Forbidden City.\n\nThat's because, for the vast majority of Chinese people, staging the Olympics was a moment of immense national pride.\n\nThat is perhaps why there is little concern about the way the organisers planned for their legacy use once the Olympic flame had been passed to London.\n\nLi Ning, China's most famous Olympian and now a hugely successful businessman, was the man given the honour of lighting the flame on that steamy, extraordinary night back in 2008.\n\nIn an exclusive interview he told me that the Olympics opened China to the world and the world to China. That's why it was so special.\n\nBut he nevertheless conceded he had some concerns over the way the stadiums were now being used and the lack of funding for grassroots sport and coaching since the Olympic circus rolled on. To hear the six-time Olympic medallist - such a prominent figure in Chinese sport - making any criticism is deeply significant in a communist country where people are still not able to express their opinions freely.\n\nChina's markets and economy might have opened up but critics, such as the artist and Bird's Nest designer Ai Weiwei, believe that when it comes to human rights the country is going backwards.\n\nIn a BBC interview for the report, carried out before I arrived in Beijing, he added that he felt the Games had done nothing for the people of China.\n\n\"Beijing would become the most quickly forgotten Games,\" he added.\n\nOf course whenever the International Olympic Committee was accused of turning a blind eye to China's human rights record, it would argue that giving the Games to the most populated country on earth would accelerate change.\n\nThere is scant evidence of this. Ai Weiwei was arrested and detained by police last year and is under constant surveillance from the authorities. And the recent controversy over dissident Chen Guangcheng has served to heighten concerns.\n\nWhile in Beijing I also spoke to a leading editor on one of China's biggest websites. He told me it was a fact of life that censors from the government worked among his staff deleting articles and comments on forums which were considered out of line with state policy.\n\n\"It's a fact of life and we just have to get on with it,\" he says.\n\nFor what it's worth my personal impression was that the city felt slightly more relaxed four years on - but that was probably more to do with the absence of the unique pressures that come with hosting the Olympics. I was at least able to ask an official, Jiang Xiaoyu, the deputy chairman of the Beijing Olympic City Development Agency (BODA), a question on human rights.\n\nYou won't be surprised that he dismissed any concerns but he did acknowledge that progress on human rights was slow.\n\nOver the last few months I have been lucky to visit three of the last five summer Olympic cities - Beijing, Barcelona and Sydney - for a special series for the Six and Ten O'Clock News and the Today programme.\n\nInterestingly a few themes have emerged which serve as vital pointers for London who, from the start of their Olympic journey seven years ago, have placed legacy right at the heart of their vision for the Games.\n\n*In each of the three cities the national pride (often referred to as intangible benefits) can't be easily dismissed. To varying degrees all three cities had their own reasons for wanting to enhance their international reputations. But does London, already a renowned world-class city, need this and if it does what sort of message about modern Britain and its capital city does it really want to send this summer?\n\nA summer of flag waving might make us all feel better but it may come to feel a bit hollow unless we can do what they did in Barcelona and Sydney and use it to help foster a greater sense of national identity and community.\n\n*Olympic stadiums which retain a running track struggle to find a workable, financially viable legacy. In Sydney's case the stadium is only the success it is today because it decided to rip up the track after the Games and concentrate on field sports. Besides exhibition matches, concerts and a winter theme park, the Bird's Nest is barely used for anything other than tourism.\n\nIn Barcelona, the main anchor tenant, football club Espanyol, moved out, leaving the local council with a costly, if beautifully built, stadium which has no long-term future.\n\nLondon is hoping West Ham will finally do a deal to move in and rent the venue - running track included - but the process has been delayed again and is still not certain. Although it has given them welcome breathing space now, organisers and the government are sure to regret rushing the original designs which ruled out converting the stadium to a proper multi-use venue which catered for Premier League football first with an option to modify the layout for track and field in the summer.\n\n*The IOC makes demands which no city can reasonably be expected to cope with. Only Sydney, after a decade of late legacy planning, has managed to now find proper sustainable uses for the majority of its venues. Beijing and Barcelona have fared less well. London is hoping its use of temporary venues and advanced planning will buck the trend on legacy but the IOC must know that asking cities to build facilities for 26 simultaneous world championships in one place every four years is unsustainable at a time of such difficult economic circumstances.\n\nRome's withdrawal and the absence of an American contender in the race for the 2020 Olympics is a clear sign that the days of world-class cities bidding for the Games may be coming to an end.\n\n*In each of the cities I went to, it was extremely difficult to find any hard evidence that staging the Games led to a significant boost to sports participation. In fact most people I asked told me exactly the opposite. This was most surprising in Australia where they have an even greater obesity crisis than in the UK. This was the biggest problem for the Government last year, who relaunched the participation strategy having abandoned the Labour administration's promise to get an extra one million people active through sport by 2012.\n\nDespite hopes that lottery money will shore up public funding for elite and grassroots sport after the Games, the UK economy is showing such sluggish growth and there are no guarantees. Future ministers may find they are having to deliver decade old promises on legacy against a backdrop of further cuts - a position which may become difficult to justify.\n\n*Finally, to finish on a more positive note, there is no doubt the Games can provide a huge boost to a city's infrastructure. Beijing and Barcelona benefited from extra investment in roads, airports and in the Catalan capital's case - a new beach and port development which changed the city's image completely. Already the benefits are being felt in Stratford with the new Olympic park, housing, Westfield and improved train and tube stations.\n\nBut has London been ambitious enough? One of the architects involved in the Barcelona project told me the Olympic Park should have been enlarged and designed to stretch further southwards to meet the River Thames, thus creating a far bigger park and more homes. He argued that would have had a far more transformative effect on the capital's deprived East End.

The athletes put on a brave face, but it is hard to stand still, let alone sprint across hurdles.\n\nThere is no longer the money to fix the air-conditioning inside the main track-and-field training facility in Athens. So Greece's Olympic stars are left to swelter.\n\nThe crash mats are torn - the stuffing bursting out - and the cushions on the equipment are fraying. The facilities have crumbled - all in the space of eight years.\n\nFor in 2004, Greece gleamed on the international stage as host of the summer Olympics, its athletes soaring.\n\nBut today, the country is choked by the worst financial crisis in its modern history - and sport, too, has been hit hard.\n\nGreece is sending its smallest Olympic team to London for 20 years. State funding for the individual sports federations has been slashed and athletes lack the very basics.\n\nImage caption Vassiliki Miloussi goes through her paces as she trains for London\n\nIn the gymnastics hall next door, Vassiliki Miloussi is preparing for her second Olympics.\n\n\"We don't have the money to pay for medicines, doctors or physiotherapists\", she says.\n\n\"We can't invest in training facilities or afford to train abroad. The federation tries its hardest, but everything is difficult now.\"\n\nAlso practising is a group of young gymnasts - the next generation of Greece's Olympic hopefuls.\n\nAs the session ends, the coach, Anastasia Dondy, prepares to drive them home. \"Their parents can't afford the petrol to pick them up from here anymore\", she says.\n\nOutside lie many of the venues from the Athens games, others dotted around the city. Most are idle, locked up and empty, simply rusting under a baking summer sun.\n\nThey mirror the decay now felt across the country - but also stand as monuments to Greece's mistakes: the massive overspend of the past, without any plan for later use.\n\nImage caption Attempts to sell the former Olympic buildings have failed\n\nThey're seen as representative of the short-term vision that got Greece into its financial mess in the first place. The hoped-for privatisation of many of the sites has been thwarted by a mix of bureaucracy and mismanagement.\n\n\"We have these facilities. What do you suggest we do? We try to rent them and we cannot\", says Spiro Pollalis, who heads the company charged with selling the largest Olympic area - the Hellinikon complex south of Athens, containing the old city airport and many of the sports venues.\n\nHe insists they should have been torn down immediately after the Games, leaving the six million square metre site free for private investors - although none has so far signed a cheque.\n\n\"These venues served their purpose but they were temporary.\"\n\nThere were mistakes and overspending from our part, but Athens was transformed into a modern city Spyros Capralos, President, Hellenic Olympic Committee\n\nBut therein lies the problem, I suggest - that spending millions of euros for three weeks of sport before dismantling the buildings might not be the best use of money.\n\n\"I disagree\", he says. \"At the time we had to host the Olympics - and we did that very well. And before we blame Greece, we need to look at other Olympic facilities and how they deteriorated. In a few years, I would like to see what will happen in London.\"\n\nSome estimates put the overall cost of the Athens Olympics at 10 billion euros.\n\nThey came at the height of Greece's borrowing boom: three years after the country joined the Euro, Athens was investing in grand infrastructure projects that it simply couldn't afford: among them, the Olympics.\n\n\"Yes there were mistakes and overspending from our part, but Athens was transformed into a modern city\", says Spyros Capralos, the President of the Hellenic Olympic Committee.\n\n\"After the Games, we had a new airport, new roads, and public transport. Athens 2004 is an easy target of blame, but instead we should blame all the people who created the government deficit over the years.\"\n\nSo if he could turn back the clock, would he again have bid for the Olympics?\n\n\"Yes - the Olympic Games were something positive for Greece.\"\n\nThey may well have presented this country in a new and attractive light and provided an excuse for important upgrades to Athens.\n\nBut as the gloss of 2004 has worn off, reality has set in, the sporting legacy remains elusive and, for some, pride at hosting the Games has begun to fade.\n\n\"Maybe the reason why we don't have much money now is that we had the Olympic Games in 2004\", says Stella Ledaki, a pole-vaulter dreaming of Olympic success.\n\n\"So I'm not sure if we had the economic stability to have the Olympics here; maybe we shouldn't have had them at all.\n\nGreek athletes hope for great things in London - in spite of, rather than thanks to, conditions back home.

Flags fly proudly from every lamppost bearing the Olympic logos, the rings and the words \"London 2012\". But what legacy will be left behind after the mountain bikers have crossed the finish line and the flags have been taken down? It is a question that has provoked strong feelings. At the planning committee meeting at Castle Point Borough Council more than 250 people filled the public gallery and overspill room. At times things got rather heated: the cheers, booing and applause from residents earned them several stern rebukes from the committee chairman. \"Be quiet, or I will clear the public gallery,\" Councillor Bill Dick warned them. At least two people got up and walked out in anger. The Olympic Games may be bringing people together, but the matter of the Olympic legacy has divided the local community around Hadleigh.\n\nThe plans have been backed by cyclists but opponents claimed the development would spoil the countryside.\n\nConservative councillor for St Mary's, Alf Partridge, said he had received scores of emails, phone calls and letters from residents about the inclusion of Benfleet Downs in the county council's plans.\n\nMr Patridge said he was angry he was barred from speaking because the site location did not fall in his ward.\n\n\"Most of the downs are used by residents from St Mary's,\" he said. \"The general message has been a call to leave our downs alone.

Add in the impact of Olympic ticket sales, which will be recorded in the third quarter, and the overall boost to the economy from the Olympic games during the period will be 0.3%, he estimates.\n\nHowever, this boost could well be temporary and actually result in lower spending later in the year, Mr Tombs says.\n\nTall order\n\nBut what of the longer-term legacy, a key part of the bidding process that helped win the Games in the first place?\n\nPublic sector funding for the Games stands at \u00a39.3bn, with some reports suggesting the final total could be double that. In public at least, the government is satisfied this will prove money well spent.\n\n\"I'm confident that we can derive over \u00a313bn of benefit to the UK economy over the next four years as a result of hosting these Games,\" said Prime Minister David Cameron at the beginning of July.\n\nImage caption David Cameron wants the Games to boost jobs and growth in Britain\n\nThis includes \u00a36bn of investment from overseas, \u00a34bn of contracts for UK firms and \u00a32.3bn of revenue from an upsurge in tourism.\n\nThat is a tall order and one that, judging by previous games, will be hard to meet.\n\nAccording to research into the past 10 Olympics by Citibank, the major economic benefits of holding the Games are realised before they begin, largely due to the massive spending on infrastructure such as building sporting venues.\n\nAnd as Mr Tombs says, \"it is hard to reuse [sporting facilities] to add productive capacity to the economy.\n\n\"The money could have been spent elsewhere on road and rail networks that would have delivered a more sustained boost.\"\n\nAn influx of tourists may also fail to materialise - visitor numbers to Sydney fell in the years after the 2000 Games, while the Athens Olympics failed to boost tourism in Greece.\n\nMr Tombs also argues that the Olympics will play little part in long-term investment decisions made by overseas companies. \"I don't expect to see a sustained increase in business investment,\" he says.\n\n'Fabulous city'\n\nBut some argue that lessons have been learned from others' mistakes - that the need to follow through on Olympic commitments has been noted.\n\n\"There is a feeling in Sydney and Athens that they they failed to fully capitalise on the Games,\" says Heather Hancock, lead London 2012 partner at consultancy Deloitte, which is a sponsor of London 2012.\n\nFor example, the government is spending \u00a3125m on Britain's biggest tourist campaign to date - GREAT - targeting 14 of the world's great cities with the aim of bringing an additional 4.6 million visitors to the UK and creating 70,000 jobs.\n\nImage caption Some previous host cities have struggled to find uses for Olympic stadiums after the Games\n\nThe campaign is looking to capitalise on what has been a two-week long advertisement for London.\n\n\"Billions have watched [the city] looking fabulous and this can only be a positive thing that must translate into more visitors next summer,\" says Justin Zatouroff, head of leisure at consultancy KPMG.\n\nThe government is also determined to continue pushing for inward investment to build on the goodwill felt towards the UK generated by the Games.\n\nAs Ms Hancock says: \"The Games showcased the capabilities of the UK - how well they were organised and the quality and timeliness of the venues. They broadened the perception of what the UK can do.\"\n\nThe window of opportunity is short, however, and \u00a313bn is quite some target for an economic legacy that has failed to materialise in most other Olympic host nations.\n\nIt will be years before we know whether UK plc will get its money back, let alone make a profit on the Games, but most economists agree major sporting events rarely bring lasting financial reward.\n\nThe government will have its work cut out to buck the trend.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=business::news.business.story.19191758.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:0c3e95a0-56d4-9141-a30e-c45d282fe0ab]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/62179000/jpg/_62179857_015621630-1.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62179000/jpg/_62179857_015621630-1.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62179000/jpg/_62179857_015621630-1.jpg", "date": "13/08/2012"}, "rank_23": {"title": "True London Olympic Games legacy is in our attitude", "text": "We've all heard about the post-Olympic legacy promises: regeneration, affordable housing and sport engagement. But what about transport?\n\nThe good news is that there ARE transport legacies. Some we can already see, but others very much depend on a change of attitude.\n\nStratford is now one of the best-connected sporting venues on the planet with 10 lines in and out of its station.\n\nThis meant even when the Central Line went down during the Games, spectators were able to change routes fairly easily.\n\nWe can also see physical infrastructure legacies.\n\nOn the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) three-carriage trains were introduced in 2010 and, no matter what Transport for London (TfL) says, the Thames Cable Car was built with the Games in mind to ferry people from the O2 to the ExCel centre.\n\nWill the cable car, though, pay its way when the Olympic crowds subside?\n\nThe wi-fi internet programme on the Tube, again finished due to an Olympic deadline, has proved very popular. But it stops being free now the Games are over. Many think that is an opportunity missed.\n\nThere has, though, been impressive interworking between train companies and TfL. For example trains were held when events finished late. You would hope some of that could be continued.\n\nRecord Tube numbers\n\nIt would also seem to make sense to continue the relaxing of rules restricting night-time deliveries as long as there are strict noise controls. This would help reduce daytime traffic on the roads.\n\nThe main legacy the government and TfL want is to end the rush-hour culture of London where millions swarm into town between 8am and 9am.\n\nLondon's commuters were very flexible and receptive to listening to complex messages about certain busy hot spots during the Games.\n\nThey came into town earlier or later or worked from home and spread the load on the transport system.\n\nSome will say the doomsday warnings were over-egged but TfL says it could not have coped on the Tube if commuters had not stayed away or changed their working patterns.\n\nIf that trend continued, there would be much more free capacity, but it depends on whether companies will continue to allow more flexibility for their workers.\n\nTfL claims it carried a record 4.5m Tube passengers last Tuesday.\n\nThe success of transport during the Olympics raises the obvious question; if it can be run well over a two-week period while the capital holds the biggest show on Earth, why can't it happen all the time?\n\nWill the success change anything politically? It will be interesting to see how much prominence the mayor gives his \"driverless trains\" plan after such a result.\n\nThe system and TfL have always been very good at delivering big events, but that is mainly due to the good will of transport workers. In my experience, they were magnificent.\n\nCan they do it all again for the Paralympics which will have similar challenges?", "images": ["https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.311.03563/img/correspondents/circles/tomedwards.png", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62177000/jpg/_62177251_stratford.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=london::news.england.london.correspondent_story.19207708.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:f17a9e0b-79f2-1a4d-a59d-147f5afbde53]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62177000/jpg/_62177251_stratford.jpg", "date": "13/08/2012"}, "rank_7": {"title": "What will the Olympic legacy for Londoners be?", "text": "It was a great London Olympics and it could be an even better Games for Londoners.\n\nFrom Team GB's brilliant medal haul, the much-derided transport system coping admirably and the feel-good atmosphere replacing the shameful images of last year's riots, the capital has benefited hugely from hosting the world's greatest sporting event.\n\nBut can 16 days of euphoria translate into real, long-term improvements for the people of the capital?\n\nBBC News looks at some areas where Londoners could see their lives improve thanks to the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nTRANSPORT\n\nIf medals were given out for areas of London which performed best during the Games, the city's maligned transport network would surely win gold.\n\nCommuters used to delays on the crowded Tube and congestion on the roads must have wondered how they could cope with the huge numbers of sport fans flooding into the capital.\n\nBut cope it did.\n\nLong-term improvements commuters can look forward to exploiting thanks to the Games include Stratford - with 10 lines in and out it could well be the best connected sporting venue on the planet.\n\nThere is now wi-fi on the Underground, which was free during the Olympics but will now be paid for. The Thames Cable Car is proving popular - but will it still be a success after the tourists leave? And a number of stations, such as King's Cross, were upgraded or improved in time for the Olympics.\n\nThere was good co-ordination between train companies and TfL, so when events finished late trains were held, and Londoners would want that to continue.\n\nIt would also seem to make sense to continue the relaxing of the rules restricting night-time deliveries as long as there are strict noise controls.

One T-shirt seller in Covent Garden said turnover was down by 30%.\n\nAccording to Experian, only three days during the first 13 of the Games saw higher numbers of shoppers in the West End and East End of London than the previous year.\n\nThe New West End Company said: \"It was quieter than we forecast in the first week but it recovered with some retailers reporting very strong sales in the last week, particularly with the sale of merchandise.\"\n\nA survey of 100 London companies by Deloitte showed 42% reported an increase in demand from customers, compared with 27% reporting a decrease. When surveyed in January, 80% expected an increase and just 4% a decrease.\n\nBut it is how London has been perceived across the world which could eventually lead to a boost in the economy.\n\nImages of a confident, cosmopolitan city coping extremely well with the Olympics and enjoying the event have been beamed across the globe, replacing the shameful scenes of rioting last summer.\n\nMayor Boris Johnson said promoting London to industry leaders during the Games had resulted in \"25 serious business leads\".\n\nAn Oxford Economics study indicates tourism gain motivated by the Games between 2012-17 is expected at 1.1 million additional visitors worth \u00a3650m to London. Mr Johnson claimed London 2012 could generate about \u00a313bn in total.\n\nColin Stanbridge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: \"Long-term London has just experienced the biggest and most impressive marketing campaign we could've wished for.\n\n\"We should reap the benefits in terms of increased tourism and business for years to come as long as we take advantage now.\"\n\nHOUSING\n\nBoris Johnson has said the Athletes' Village will be converted into 2,818 new homes and renamed East Village. Half of them will be affordable with families moving in next year.\n\nEventually the Olympic Park will house five new neighbourhoods, with up to 8,000 new homes completed by 2015.\n\nEast London's Newham Council says it will place 300 families in the park. Its mayor Sir Robin Wales admits it is just a start, saying it is just a \"small number compared to the demand\".\n\nCarpenters Against Regeneration Plans, a local group which claims Newham Council plans to remove residents and demolish the Carpenter's Estate adjacent to the park, said: \"I think the housing legacy will be to get on a bus and get out of Newham.\n\n\"I think that is what the mayor is hoping to do with a lot of people here - the kind of people he does not want.\n\n\"Those that are lower income, those that are poorer.\"\n\nNewham Council said residents will not lose out in the major redevelopment of the estate.\n\nA spokesman for housing charity Shelter said: \"It's great that after the Olympic Games come to a close, almost half of the homes in the Athletes' Village will be affordable housing.\n\n\"With so many families in the capital facing a daily struggle to keep a roof over their heads due to the high cost of housing, these homes will be very welcome.\"\n\nVOLUNTEERING\n\nIOC president Jacques Rogge described them as \"heroes\" and they got the biggest cheer at the closing ceremony.\n\nImage caption The Games Makers were \"heroes\"\n\nThe 70,000 Games Makers, decked out in pink and purple, were pivotal to the smooth running the Olympics.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron highlighted the fact that half a million people applied to become Olympic volunteers.\n\nHe said: \"Bottling this volunteering spirit, I think, is really vital.\"\n\nVolunteering England said there was not a shortage of volunteers, but a lack of resources.\n\nThe government's most recent Citizenship Survey shows Londoners are slightly below the England average in terms of volunteering.\n\nAbout 40% of Games Makers said they had never volunteered before.\n\nSir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: \"The spirit of voluntarism is alive and well.\n\n\"The challenge now is to harness the energy of this new generation of volunteers.\"", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/62238000/jpg/_62238227__62218566_62218451.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62238000/jpg/_62238227__62218566_62218451.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=london::news.england.london.story.19214354.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:08b6c480-1aeb-b246-aa7e-fcc47588e48d]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62238000/jpg/_62238227__62218566_62218451.jpg", "date": "14/08/2012"}, "rank_166": {"title": "Olympics: Government puts clubs at heart of legacy plans", "text": "The government will seek to build a participation legacy from London 2012 by creating closer links between sports clubs and schools.\n\nThirty of the 46 sports currently funded by the government's agency for grassroots sport have applied for cash to set up new \"satellite clubs\".\n\nIf we don't get club sport right, we can forget about getting school sport and elite performance right Tim Lamb Chief executive, Sport Recreation Alliance\n\nThese are intended to bridge the gap between schools and community sport.\n\n\"We want more young people doing sport as a habit for life,\" said Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.\n\n\"That means better provision of sport in our schools, and more particularly making sure people don't drop sport when they leave school.\"\n\nAlmost \u00a350m has been set aside to fund the plan, from a total Sport England budget of \u00a31bn.\n\n\"What we've said is that all sports getting funding will have to set up satellite clubs in secondary schools,\" continued Hunt.\n\n\"Our objective is that every school will have two or three of these clubs, and the beauty of this is that you will continue to be a member when you leave school.\n\n\"That way more people will continue to play and they'll already be integrated with local leagues.

About 60% of the total WSP pot will be directed at the priority 14-25 age group.\n\nTackling the \"drop-off\" problem has been broadly welcomed by the British Olympic family, although some NGBs have voiced concerns that clubs need more help if they are to deliver the goal of a fitter, more cohesive and sportier nation.\n\nTop 10 once-a-week participation sports 1.

They enter into the world of club sport where they get the coaching, competition and the access to facilities that they need.\n\n\"But clubs are facing all kinds of challenges, from managing their finances through the recession, to dealing with punitive tax burdens.\"\n\nLamb's words echo comments made by a number of sports to the BBC about the difficulties their member clubs face, particularly access to and cost of facilities, rising tax bills and \"health and safety\" red tape.\n\nTwo tax-related measures the government could take are reducing the amount of VAT payable on the hire of facilities, and allowing clubs to claim Gift Aid on junior subscriptions, as is the case elsewhere in the leisure sector.\n\nThe European Union recently granted members the right to reduce the amount of tax they charge on these transactions and nine countries have done so.

The post-Wimbledon boom in tennis participation is an annual example of this, as it has usually gone bust by August.\n\nAvoiding this pattern is the challenge faced by the 36 sports that have just starred in the greatest advert for the benefits of physical activity Britain has ever seen.\n\nBut it is also a challenge for the country.\n\nWe paid for London 2012 and the quid pro quo was that the Games would \"inspire a generation\" to pick up a hockey stick, tennis racquet, or just the phone to find out when the pool opens or where the nearest running club is based.\n\nLondon 2012's physical \"legacy\" is apparent to anybody who has visited the Olympic Park, or one of the other new permanent venues.\n\nBut the rest of the country will have to make do with the much harder to define legacy of a happier, healthier nation. This will take time, money and leadership, but sport will never get a chance like this again.\n\nHaving seen what happened - or failed to happen - 24 years ago, hockey is determined not to let this opportunity slip away.\n\n\"We started by asking if we were providing the type of opportunities to play that people really want - we know traditional club hockey isn't for everybody,\" said Holly Woodford, England Hockey's development director.\n\nA \"Back to Hockey\" initiative was launched to tempt ex-players back into the game, a child-friendly format called \"Quicksticks\" was spun out to primary schools, and \"Rush Hockey\" was promoted as the sport's answer to five-a-side football.\n\nIn March, Team GB's players visited schools to meet youngsters, dish out freebies and sell the sport to parents and teachers. Next there was the \"Big Dribble\", a campaign that saw thousands take part in an attempt to dribble hockey balls 2,012km from Edinburgh to Trafalgar Square.\n\nA final push came at the Olympic tournament itself, where two mini pitches were set up next to the Riverbank Stadium for the sport's 630,000 ticket-holders to try rush hockey: over the fortnight, more than 30,000 of them did.\n\nTop 10 sports by Sport England funding 2009-13 1. Cricket, \u00a338,003,357 2. Rugby Union, \u00a331,219,004 3. Rugby League, \u00a329,408,341 4. Tennis, \u00a326, 800,000 5. Football, \u00a325,635,000 6. Cycling, \u00a324,288,000 7.

Past experience isn't encouraging,\" admitted Woodford.\n\n\"But we have added 27,000 players in the last six months so the steps we've taken are working.\n\n\"Can we cope with a potential influx? We think so. We've created 20,000 new playing opportunities at 600 locations over the next five weeks.\"\n\nHockey has been given \u00a311.5m by Sport England, the government agency in charge of \"sport for all\". That was decided in 2009, and all 46 national governing bodies (NGBs) funded by the agency are waiting for feedback on their 2013-17 applications.\n\nNervous times, then, particularly when the majority have seen almost no change in participation despite the unprecedented amounts of money directed at them since 2005.\n\nHockey, at least, is buoyed by its best set of results for 20 years: both teams reached their semi-finals, with the women taking bronze.\n\nThose teams received \u00a315m in funding from UK Sport, the body responsible for channelling money to elite sport, and England Hockey has attracted several sponsors.\n\nThe situation is less rosy for other sports, especially the new ones that needed \"host nation\" places to compete at London 2012.\n\nVolleyball was arguably the most successful of these, as both its women's indoor and beach volleyball pair claimed a victory, something the handball and water polo squads failed to achieve.\n\nVolleyball's London 2012 legacy in numbers - 8,492 people tried the \"Go Spike\" speed cage in Hyde Park during the Games - 3,834 took part in \"Come & Try\" sessions in Hyde Park and Victoria Park - Volleyball England had an 850% increase in website visits, with \"club finder\" the most popular page - 7,500 tonnes of sand were donated by Locog for 35 new beach courts - 160 athletes in \"talent pathways\" for beach and indoor volleyball are being supported - 50,000 youngsters have tried volleyball for first time since 2009\n\nAnd yet volleyball's governing body, which runs four Olympic and two Paralympic teams on a four-year UK Sport grant of \u00a34.3m, has been forced to wave goodbye to Harry Brokking, the Dutch coach of its men's team. It could not afford him.\n\nThe sport does not receive much more for its community work either, just \u00a35.6m coming from Sport England.\n\nSo it was overjoyed when London 2012's organisers decided to donate the 7,500 tonnes of sand used at the Games and test events to create, with Sport England help, 35 beach volleyball courts across the South East.\n\nThis news, coupled with anecdotal evidence the governing body is getting from its clubs, is providing grounds for optimism. But it will be a long haul.\n\n\"We have made unbelievable progress,\" said Lisa Wainwright, the chief executive of Volleyball England.\n\n\"But you can't measure us after four years - give us 12.\n\n\"If you haven't got role models like [cyclists] Vicky Pendleton or Sir Chris Hoy the media aren't interested. That is why London was so important. It gave us some profile.\"\n\nWainwright's call for patience was echoed by the boss of another British Olympic team sport who asked to remain anonymous such is the sensitivity over funding for sports without obvious \"medal potential\".\n\n\"You can't do anything in sports like ours overnight, and overnight in sport is five years,\" he said.\n\nOne critic of the current funding regime who did not mind going on the record was John Amaechi, the former NBA star.\n\n\"British basketball is a series of cottage industries - politically it is a mess,\" he said.\n\nFormer NBA star John Amaechi\n\n\"There is no leadership, and there are too many committees and agendas. But Sport England is culpable too - the goals it sets are absurd.\n\n\"The idea you can grow a sport by counting how many people do something for x minutes a week is ridiculous.\n\n\"You need to provide affordable places to play and coaching. Constant engagement is the key.\n\n\"I am angry about this because there is talent out there, we're wasting it and I don't see any evidence things will be different after the Olympics.\"\n\nAmaechi's frustration stems from the fact he has provided a model of how a sport like basketball can flourish in an area where football is king.\n\nThe Amaechi Basketball Centre near Stockport, where he grew up, is Britain's only purpose-built venue for the sport. After more than a decade fostering community links, the centre is used by 3,000 players a week.\n\nEngland Basketball, on the other hand, was one of the governing bodies that had its Sport England funding reduced for failing to hit participation targets.\n\nNobody is suggesting this is easy, or that a country of 60 million people can be good at everything.\n\nBut there will be a very short-lived legacy to London 2012 without a co-ordinated strategy for encouraging people to try a sport for the first time, or tempt them back, and then keeping them interested.\n\nEngland Hockey's Woodford described a \"virtuous cycle for grassroots participation\".\n\n\"Success at elite level leads to visibility, and that gives you a chance to boost participation, which should help you succeed in the future,\" she explained.\n\nSounds simple, doesn't it? And yet we are still waiting for our first winner in the men's singles at Wimbledon for 86 years.", "images": ["https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg",

Corporation (LLDC).\n\nThe site will reopen from July 2013.\n\nSport England figures show east London has a lower uptake in disabled sports than the rest of London.\n\nThe park - to be renamed the

including wheelchair rugby, boccia, wheelchair basketball and Goalball in the Copper Box.\n\nFigures from government agency Sport England show that of those living with a disability in central London 22.1% participate in sport once a week; in north London 18.4%; south London 24.4% and west London 21.2%.\n\nBut in east London, including Stratford and the Paralympic boroughs, the figure is the

last time the crowds will cheer, Union Jacks will wave, gold medals will be flourished. Today the country will take one last gulp of Olympic spirit.\n\nSo potent has it proved that the political games, which begin as London 2012 ends, will see endless attempts to prove that it all goes to show how right the speaker is about the need (delete where applicable) for public investment; to pick winners; to promote competition; to focus on what the disabled can do rather than what they can't; to oppose cuts; to rediscover our pride as a nation... etc.\n\nToday at their annual congress the TUC's general secretary took the first step on a path every political leader, except perhaps Alex Salmond, is sure to follow.\n\nThere will be endless promises to ensure that there is a positive legacy of London 2012, that we are more sporting as a nation, more inclusive and that the Olympic Park revives east London and does not become a white elephant.\n\nHowever, I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen, that we will see one part of the Olympic legacy made flesh on display today on London's streets.\n\nIt is none other than the man who once said that his chances of being prime minister were \"about as good as the chances of finding Elvis on Mars or being reincarnated as an olive\". He is the Tory politician who is cheered, not booed, by Olympic crowds*. He is the man who is laughed with and not at when he dangles helplessly from a zip wire.\n\nYes, Boris - who along with Seb has been the non-sporting face of the Games - has, thanks to the Olympics, become not just that cheeky chap who brings a smile to your face, but the Conservative who makes his party's activists' hearts race and pulses quicken, who says the things they want to hear and who is not sullied by coalition.\n\nSo it is that Tory backbenchers put two and two together and made five when they figured that if the government proceeded with a third runway before the election (they've said they won't) then Zac Goldsmith will hand his seat (which is far from a safe Tory constituency) to Boris (who'd be accused of breaking his promise to complete a full term as mayor) who could then challenge Cameron for the Tory leadership (which would destroy his brand as someone who is \"unlike all those other scheming, calculating, self-interested politicians\".)\n\nBoris and Zac did, we now know, talk about the idea but only, it's claimed, to laugh about it. I wonder.\n\nThe history of Boris is that he has been underestimated, not least by me. I knew him at Oxford where I never thought for a minute that he'd be a politician.\n\nI broke the story that he was running to be mayor but didn't take it at all seriously, so only mentioned it in passing on my blog. I sat with one very senior Tory who discussed whether \"to let Boris run\" (little did they know). I dismissed the talk of him one day leading his party as fanciful.\n\nWell, not any more. Boris now takes on the role once played by Michael Heseltine to Margaret Thatcher, Michael Portillo to John Major or Gordon Brown to Tony Blair.\n\nHe is now the prince over the water whether he, and whether his old school friend Dave, likes it or not. Everything he says and does from his power base (which is appropriately down river from Westminster and on the other bank of the Thames) will be seen through the prism of his scarcely-concealed political ambition.\n\nHis decision to condemn the prime minister's reshuffle and promise to fight plans for the expansion of Heathrow have guaranteed that.\n\nThe story of the next couple of years in Tory politics will be defined, in part, by how he and the prime minister - who may appear together today to celebrate the Games - learn to live together.\n\n* Jeremy Hunt joined Theresa May and George

healthy.\n\nThe WSFF also believes women do not get the same media coverage as men.\n\nBritish women's London 2012 medals GOLD (11) Nicola Adams (boxing), Charlotte Dujardin (equestrian), Jessica

group: \"The achievements of Jessica Ennis, Sarah Storey, Kath Grainger and so many others have taken support for women's sport to new heights and made 2012 the best year ever for women's sport.\n\n\"But we cannot rely on goodwill alone to overcome the obstacles to women's sport taking its proper place in public life.\n\n\"This has to change or the Olympic legacy will have failed for women.\"\n\nWSFF is proposing a strategy that would see greater media coverage of women in sport, a rethink of school sport to encourage more female participation, more female leadership at the highest levels of sport and more opportunities for participation.\n\nAccording to WSFF, only 5% of sports media coverage is devoted to women and 0.5% of commercial investment.\n\n\"We need to make sure that young girls and women are given more opportunities to see their female sports heroes in action to inspire them to get active,\" said Tibballs.\n\nMeanwhile, at the age of 14, only 12% of girls are doing what is considered enough physical activity, half the figure for boys of the same age.\n\n\"The issues are endemic and chronic,\" Tibballs added. \"We can't solve all this overnight but we need to capitalise on the level of interest [generated by the Olympics].\"\n\nWSFF wants the government to scrutinise how public money is spent on sport to find out if the funding is reaching women.\n\nBut it also says that there are problems deeply ingrained in society that need to be addressed.\n\nTibballs added: \"For young women to do a sport when their mates are not, the chances are they will be viewed with suspicion because they are not paying enough attention to their appearance.\"", "images": ["https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg",

month before the World Athletics Championships.\n\nIf the bid is succesful, it will be the first time a city has hosted the two championships in the same year.\n\nThe bid came as UK Sport announced a campaign to create an Olympic legacy by bringing 36 World and European championships to the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Gold Event Series will use \u00a327m of lottery money over the next six years and aims to bring a total of more than 70 sporting events to the UK.\n\nWhat is the Gold Event Series? The series is a National Lottery-funded campaign that aims to bring more than 70 of the world's top sporting events to the UK\n\nCampaign organisers hope those events will attract 2.5 million spectators in the UK to watch world-class sport\n\nEvents will be held at eight London 2012 venues, plus other locations across the country\n\nThose other locations include five venues being used for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow\n\nThe first event in the Series will be the UCI Track Cycling World Cup at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome in Glasgow, which runs over three days and starts this Friday\n\nAmong the events being targeted are the semi-finals and final of football's European Championships in 2020 and the Hockey World Cup.\n\nJohnson, who is also chairman of the London Legacy Development Corporation, said: \"The huge appetite for tickets to the 2012 Games this summer shows the level of excitement Paralympic sport can generate, and forever changed the way we think about disabled sport.\n\n\"The 2017 IPC World Championships present a fantastic opportunity for us to build on that phenomenal surge of enthusiasm and welcome back some of the world's greatest sportsmen and women to the Olympic Stadium.\n\n\"Securing the championships would not only reinforce London's reputation as the world's leading sporting city, it would bring a vital multi-million pound boost to the capital's economy, creating jobs and driving growth in east London.\"\n\nBids are also in place for the 2016 Track Cycling World Championships and European Swimming Championships.\n\nThe Diving World Series, the World Triathlon Series, the World Figure Skating Championships and the Track Cycling World Cup are also being targeted as part of the campaign, which has been launched as a partnership between UK Sport and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nUK Sport said that 15 of the 70 events being lined up have already been confirmed.\n\nSports Minister Hugh Robertson did, however, rule out any thoughts of bidding again for the football World Cup after the failure of England's 2018 bid.\n\nHe said: \"All those of us who went through that experience are scarred as a result of it.\n\n\"I still don't understand how you can put together a technical bid that was judged so far in front of anyone else's and still only get one vote apart from your own.\"\n\nSimon Morton, UK Sport's director of major events and international relations, said \"several British cities\" could bid for the Commonwealth Games in the 2020s.\n\nHe also revealed that the \u00a3269m Olympics Aquatics centre would not be able to host the world swimming championships because 15,000 of the 17,500 seats are to be removed to make a much smaller venue.\n\nMorton said that as a result, the European Championships was the largest swimming event that the aquatics centre could bid for.\n\nLiz Nicholl, UK Sport chief executive, said: \"In developing the Gold Event Series, UK Sport is building on the success of London 2012 and supporting the UK's ongoing legacy goals.\n\n\"The continued hosting of world-class events supports our athletes' performance ambitions, provides a unique

The Chance to Shine survey found 54% of pupils had been inspired to take up a new sport as a result of the Olympics.\n\nHowever, eight out of parents said their children were playing the same amount of sport or less during school hours following the Games and its results suggested many pupils do less than the recommended two hours of sport a week.\n\n'Aspiration'\n\nIt also found that 54% of the parents five to 16-year-olds polled said their children played less than two hours of games or PE in school a week.\n\nIn Sheffield, the home of gold medal-winning heptathlete Jessica Ennis, 60% of parents say their children do less than the stipulated two hours a week.\n\nRules requiring schools to report on whether they had met that target were scrapped by Education Secretary Michael Gove in 2010.\n\nThe Department for Education said at the time it was an unenforceable aspiration.\n\nHowever, Mr Gove told schools at the time he expected them to maintain their current levels of PE and sport.\n\nWhen parents in the survey were asked what the biggest challenges facing schools trying to increase the amount of sport their pupils play, 42% of parents blamed time pressures of the curriculum.\n\nA third of parents blamed a lack of facilities and 29% blamed a lack of funding for school sports.\n\n'Inspired'\n\nWasim Khan, chief executive of Chance to Shine, which runs cricketing schemes in 6,500 schools in the UK, said: \"The fact that parents are saying that their children are doing less than two hours of school sport a week is a concern.\n\n\"We want young people to do as much physical activity as possible in and out of school - whether it's cricket, athletics or another sport - to help them lead active, healthy lives.\n\n\"Parents are saying that many of their children were inspired by the Olympic Games to play more or to try a new sport.\n\n\"We owe it to those children to ensure we have the right infrastructure to make it a reality.\"\n\nOlympic legacy?\n\nA message on the youth legacy section of the London 2012 website says: \"Since it won the bid to host the Games, London 2012 has worked closely with partners and stakeholders on activation programmes to promote sports participation in the run-up to, during and after the Games.\n\n\"For example, 14,000 schools and more than five million young people took part in the 2012 National School Sports Week sponsored by Lloyds TSB.\"\n\nGeneral secretary of the National Union of Teachers, Christine Blower, said the Olympic Legacy was alive and well and being nurtured by our PE teachers.\n\n\"Many NUT members are involved in sports clubs of all kinds both during and outside of school.\n\n\"Think how much more, though, could be done if the government hadn't all but scrapped the Schools Sports Partnership and presided over the sell-off of playing fields.\n\n\"Teachers want to see an Olympic legacy. The question is does the government?\"\n\nThe panel of parents were surveyed online by Opinion Matters in early November.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"We want more young people to take part in competitive sport - not only so they lead healthy and active lifestyles but also so they develop new skills and learn how to work as a team.\n\n\"This is why we are putting competitive sport at the heart of the new primary school curriculum and extending the School Games competition.

"text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Cycling feels benefits of London 2012\n\nSix months on from the London Games, the grand promise to inspire us to becoming a fitter, sportier nation seems to be on track.\n\nAccording to Sport England's latest edition of the Active People survey, published just before Christmas, there's been a 750,000 increase in the number of people playing sport once a week in the last year.\n\nTake it all the way back to 2006 - a year after London won the right to stage the Games - and you can see a very steady increase - 1.6m extra people.\n\nThis is not to be dismissed lightly but given the huge sums of public money invested over the last seven years one might argue that the dial should have moved more dramatically.\n\nThe risk for the Government is that by only backing winners they cut adrift other sports - especially cheap and accessible team sports like basketball - and remove that inspirational factor which was at the heart of the London philosophy\n\nDrill into the data in a little more detail and the picture is not quite so healthy. Much of the increase in the last year came in a small number of sports - led by cycling, athletics and swimming.\n\nOthers such as rowing, gymnastics and basketball have barely registered an increase. After a year like 2012 that has to be deeply worrying for those politicians and administrators who vowed to inspire a generation.\n\nA survey by the Sport and Recreation Alliance of all sports clubs found that while the Olympics did lead to a surge in interest in sports like gymnastics, a lack of facilities and coaching meant that interest couldn't be absorbed.\n\nThe challenge now will be to ensure facilities and coaching can be upgraded quickly enough to ensure any momentum is not lost.\n\nThe debate which has polarised sport in recent weeks has not focused on the grassroots but the elite level. While the Government has rewarded those sports like cycling which delivered medals in abundance in London, it has punished those who failed like basketball and volleyball by removing funding for the top athletes.\n\nThe legacy of London 2012 appears healthy - at first glance\n\nPeople like Sir Clive Woodward, the BOA's former director of elite performance, argue the Government and UK Sport have got it wrong and that by cutting off the supply of cash for those at the top they risk removing the role models needed to inspire people to get off their sofas and play sport.\n\nNonsense, says the Sports Minister Hugh Robertson, who told me this week: \"Those sports that have failed should stop whingeing about it and take a long hard look at themselves, work out why they failed and put it right.\"\n\nIt's harsh but it's also the post London reality. Only those who succeed will be rewarded.\n\nThe risk for the Government is that by only backing winners they cut adrift other sports - especially cheap and accessible team sports like basketball - and remove that inspirational factor which was at the heart of the London philosophy.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=other::sport.front_page.correspondent_story.21206868.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:ee69ef7e-8224-5344-bf1a-712d788ee248]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_PS]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/65521000/jpg/_65521721_143035846.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/activity-guide.jpg", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/64016000/jpg/_64016140_david-bond_144x81.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired-logo.svg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/65521000/jpg/_65521721_143035846.jpg", "date": "25/01/2013"}, "rank_83": {"title": "Olympic legacy in east London six months on", "text": "It's six months since the amazing summer of sports with the Olympics and Paralympics kicked off.

We need to capitalise on that success but there is a danger of the volunteering legacy fizzling out.\n\n\"The Cabinet Office must demonstrate that it is not missing the boat, so that there is a lasting volunteering legacy both within sport and beyond.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Margaret Hodge: The committee \"are worried about the speed and... worried about the total\"\n\nThey said they had been told there would be programmes to build on the volunteering spirit, but found there was \"no clear plan for capitalising on the contribution Games Makers can make to other volunteering initiatives\".\n\nThe committee also criticised the ticketing system used for the London Olympics, which saw the public unable to buy a large proportion of tickets for major events.\n\nOnly 51% of tickets for the men's 100m final were available to the British public and only 47% of tickets for the track cycling, the MPs said.\n\n\"International sports bodies and media organisations wield a lot of power and it cannot be easy for individual event organisers to push back at their demands,\" the report says.\n\n\"But, learning from the experience of the London Games, the government, possibly alongside other governments and event organisers, should challenge demands for large numbers of accredited seats.\"\n\nAnd the committee raised concerns that the National Lottery would not see the \u00a32bn it put towards the cost of the Olympic Park repaid.\n\nIt was agreed that the lottery would be repaid from future returns from developments at the Olympic Park, but the committee said current projections suggest the first payment will not be until the mid-2020s.\n\nMrs Hodge added: \"Lottery good causes lost money during the period running up to the Games.\n\n'Rapacious developer'\n\n\"They need to be assured that they will get some of this back from the financial returns secured from the development of the Olympic Park.\"\n\nOverall, the MPs found the success of London 2012 demonstrated it was possible for government departments to work together and with other bodies effectively to deliver complex programmes.\n\nBut they stressed the government must build on this success in delivering other major projects.\n\nA Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"The government is committed to delivering a tangible, lasting legacy from the Games and work is well under way on this.\n\n\"We have been crystal clear that the lottery has an entitlement to receive \u00a3675m from land sales from the Olympic Park, that is bound by a legal agreement between the government and Mayor of London.\"\n\nLondon Legacy Development Corporation chief executive Dennis Hone said: \"We are looking at what would be the best solution, not just for the area of the Olympic Park, but also for the wider regeneration of the East End.\n\n\"While there is a drive to maximise receipts and get the taxpayers' money back, no-one would want us to act as some kind of rapacious developer at the risk of jeopardising the long-term legacy of the Park.\n\n\"It is a balance and we have to work that through over the coming months.\"\n\nFor Labour, shadow sports minister Clive Efford warned the government against \"throwing away\" the \"the extraordinary contribution of the volunteer Games Makers\".\n\n\"Building on their energy and enthusiasm we could create the capacity in our communities and schools to get sport and other activities going at the grass roots,\" he added.", "images":

It found: A third of teachers believed participation has decreased since government cuts to School Sports Partnerships\n\nThe same level said that standards of sports provision had got worse at their schools under the new system\n\n69% of primary teachers and 58% at secondaries said only part - or none - of the government money provided for the PE teacher release scheme was being used to organise school games in their areas Full survey results (external site)\n\nThe think-tank refers to a \"sharp decline\" in school sports since that ring-fenced investment (enabling secondary schools to co-ordinate tuition, and lend PE teachers to smaller primaries that needed them) was cut, blaming a lack of funding.\n\nSome \u00a363m was reinstated in a new teacher-release programme and a boosted \"School Games\". However, according to the Smith Institute, 88% of School Games organisers and school sport co-ordinators said 'the old system was better', and that participation had declined.\n\nClive Efford, Labour's Shadow Minister for Sport, says the research proves the government's policy was \"a disaster for the Olympic legacy... They failed to seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"\n\nHowever, a Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said the research was \"self-selecting, including SSP staff themselves, so cannot be taken seriously.\n\n\"After seven years of SSPs at a cost of \u00a32.4bn, only around two in five pupils played competitive sport regularly at school.\"\n\nWhen we are given a large pot of money, different sport organisations often fight for their slice of the cake Andy Reed Chairman of the Sport and Recreation Alliance\n\nIn March, after months of talks in Whitehall, the government and a new national strategy aimed at improving the quality of sport and PE, especially in primary schools.\n\nUnder what some have called the \"privatisation of PE\", schools will hire coaches from specialist providers, governing bodies, or even professional football clubs.\n\nThat investment is rolled out from the start of the academic year in September, and there is inevitably now huge interest in whether it can provide a real boost to school sport. But it is still unclear how exactly this spending will be monitored, and what guidance schools will get to make the right choices.\n\nThis issue matters greatly. The extent to which our children play sport has an impact far beyond Team GB's long-term medal hopes. At a time of worrying levels of childhood obesity, an active youth can relieve pressure on the National Health Service and even cut crime.\n\nNo surprise then, that school sport has been back on the agenda in Westminster this week with the Education Select Committee hearing evidence on school sport policy for the first time since the Olympics.\n\nSurvey verdict \"The main reasons mentioned for those who indicated decreased levels of participation were a lack of funding and as a consequence pressure on time. This was impacting the ability of schools to run sports clubs, competitions and events and therefore resulted in fewer opportunities for participation. Those who were able to maintain or increase levels of participation cited longer working days, their school's commitment to sport and continued collaboration. There were concerns from some, however, about how sustainable this will be.\" Read more from the Smith Institute's survey (external site)\n\nOlympic triple jump legend Jonathan Edwards did not hold back, arguing the government's new policy would result in \"patchy provision\" and said the demise of SSPs was \"a very bad move\".\n\nAndy Reed, chairman of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, told the committee: \"When we are given a large pot of money, different sport organisations often fight for their slice of the cake.\n\n\"We need to see a genuine cross-departmental approach to sport and really strong strategic direction from a central body would assist the sector as a whole.\"\n\nOn the loss of SSPs, Reed added: \"We were very disappointed. They made enormous progress in school sports. But that's gone now and so we need to bang heads together to get sport to work together.\"\n\nFew areas of policy it seem, provoke as much debate or disagreement as school sport. As we approach the first anniversary of the London Games, a consensus seems as far away as ever, but an approach that works is essential, not just for the government, but the country too.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/mcs/media/images/64821000/jpg/_64821029_139764292.jpg", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/65643000/jpg/_65643743_65643516.jpg", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/60780000/jpg/_60780024_danroan.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/activity-guide.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=other::sport.front_page.correspondent_story.22565153.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:ef0b4941-1257-f445-82de-467e2f444e8b]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_PS]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired-logo.svg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/65643000/jpg/_65643743_65643516.jpg", "date": "17/05/2013"}, "rank_145": {"title": "BBC launches Blue Peter sport badge and Olympic TV series", "text": "Blue Peter will launch a new sport badge to help increase sport participation across the country.\n\nIt hopes to inspire children to act out the legacy of London 2012 and marks the programme badge's 50th anniversary.\n\nGolden Hoy - the gold medals Olympic Games 2012: Team sprint & keirin\n\n2008: Team sprint, keirin & sprint\n\n2004: 1km track time trial\n\nBBC One will also air a new Olympic magazine series called Inspire: The Olympic Journey to also continue the legacy of the Games.\n\nThe monthly series will begin on 27 July - exactly one year on from the London 2012 opening ceremony.\n\nThe show will celebrate the biggest names, the rising stars and the unsung heroes of Olympic sport and will be presented by Gabby Logan, airing on Saturday afternoons.\n\nThe series will be accompanied by Get Inspired, a BBC-wide initiative to promote participation and help individuals get more involved in grass-root sporting activities.\n\nBBC Sport director Barbara Slater said: \"The Get Inspired initiative will take advantage of the BBC's role as the nation's leading sports broadcaster, encouraging sports participation across the UK and providing viewers with tools to help get involved.\"\n\nThe first episode will air from the Commonwealth Games site in Glasgow with six-time gold medallist Sir Chris Hoy joining Gabby on a tour of the Velodrome named in his honour and to discuss his illustrious career.\n\nFour-time rowing Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent will also explore the true meaning of the Olympic legacy.\n\nThe special Blue Peter badge will be awarded to children who can prove they have been instrumental in creating their very own sporting legacy and will be handed out from July until September this year.\n\nEwan Vinnicombe, editor of Blue Peter, said: \"It's the 50th anniversary year for the original Blue Peter badge so I'm delighted that we are launching a new badge to inspire our audience to enjoy sport with their friends.\n\n\"A brilliant legacy after an amazing year of sport in the UK.\"", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/68108000/jpg/_68108615_blue_peter_badge.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/mcs/media/images/68108000/jpg/_68108682_blue_peter_badge.jpg", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/activity-guide.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=olympics::sport.olympics.story.22855758.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:046ed5c0-bec7-4045-a134-f333ea4a931f]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_PS]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired-logo.svg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/68108000/jpg/_68108615_blue_peter_badge.jpg", "date": "11/06/2013"}, "rank_134": {"title": "Olympic legacy 'undermined by budget cuts'", "text": "We apologise for the lack of pictures at the start of this video.

the claims were met with scepticism by some economists and the Federation of Small Businesses.\n\nGovernment estimates put the cost of hosting the Games at \u00a38.9bn.\n\n'Creative accounting'\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron said \"a lot of deals were done\" around the time of the Olympics.\n\nAnalysis It would be rude to call the benefit numbers flakey. But most economists would say they were deeply speculative, at best. The point is not that the Games didn't bring economic benefits - it would be hard for something that cost roughly \u00a39bn not to have any economic benefits. And of course they brought lots of more intangible benefits, for all of us. But the \u00a39.9bn figure we got today is supposed to be the extra business for UK firms from 2012, in addition to the jobs and income that were directly generated by building the stadium and other investments to prepare for the Games. To make even a rough guess of the extra business generated, you need to have a sense of what would have happened anyway; what academics would call \"the counterfactual\". They never really provide that in today's glossy report. The implicit assumption seems to be that - had it not been for the Olympics - that \u00a39bn would simply not have been spent.\n\nThe report, for the UK Trade and Investment department (UKTI), said the Olympics resulted in:\n\n\u00a32.5bn \"additional inward investment\", 58% of which was outside London\n\n\u00a35.9bn additional sales following Olympic-related promotions by the Foreign Office and UKTI\n\n\u00a31.5bn high value overseas contracts - such as helping to design venues in other host-nations\n\nMuch of the Olympic park and stadium for the Winter Olympics in Russia was \"designed and built by British businesses\", Mr Cameron told BBC Radio's Test Match Special.\n\n\"So there's real jobs, real money in the Olympics if we get it right.\"\n\nBut sports economist Stefan Szymanski said it was impossible to tell how much of the economic activity could be put down to the Games.\n\n\"It's almost like a bit of creative accounting. There's no way of testing whether what they're saying is really true.\"\n\nJonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former chief economist at the Cabinet Office, said attributing the economic benefits to the Olympics was \"a little far-fetched to say the least\".\n\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable defended the figures in the report.\n\n\"A lot of people were very cynical about this... but as a result of all the work that was done we have this very considerable amount,\" he said.\n\nHe added there was an \"upward estimate\" that, by 2020, the Games could have benefited the UK by as much as \u00a340bn.\n\n'Thrilling chapter'\n\nOne engineering firm which was behind the Olympic park on the 2012 site said the Games had boosted its standing with other host countries and governments delivering large-scale transport and urban regeneration projects.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Vince Cable: \"A very considerable net benefit is going to come to the UK from the Games\"\n\nMike McNicholas from the Atkins consultancy said: \"What we saw in the run-up to the games was a huge interest from overseas governments and industry to look at how the Games was delivered.\"\n\nBut for businesses outside London, The Federation of Small Businesses said the impact of the Games had been a disappointment.\n\n\"The contracts we were expecting really didn't materialise,\" said national policy chairman Mike Cherry.\n\nAs well as the financial impact of the Games, the report - Inspired by 2012: The legacy from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games - highlights its influence on sport and regeneration.\n\nIt also says the Games volunteers inspired more people to take up similar roles in their communities.\n\nThe National Council for Voluntary Organisations said there had been an \"encouraging\" boost to volunteering. But funding cuts to the voluntary sector left a \"question mark\" over the Games' legacy, executive director Justin Davis-Smith warned.\n\nThe prime minister said: \"If you go back to when we first won the Olympics in 2005, we've got 1.4 million more people taking part in sport every week.\"\n\nImage caption The purchase of Battersea Power Station was among the post-Games deals cited in the report\n\nBut BBC sports editor David Bond said in the last year participation had actually dropped by 200,000.\n\nLabour's Olympics spokeswoman Tessa Jowell called on the government to reverse the \"damage inflicted\" to school sport funding.\n\nThe report also found that employment programmes by Boris Johnson the Mayor of London had failed to deliver long-term Olympic jobs for the capital with only a fraction of people going into the jobs predicted.\n\nIn a message in the report, Olympics legacy ambassador Lord Coe, who chaired Games organiser Locog, said: \"Progress reflected in this report against each of the legacy commitments is a promising start.\n\n\"There can, however, be no room for complacency. Just as the Games took 10 years to win, plan and deliver, so legacy must be seen as a 10-year project to realise lasting change.\"\n\nInternational Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said: \"The London 2012 Games have definitively served as a catalyst for development and improvements, both tangible and intangible, which would otherwise have taken decades to achieve.\"", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=uk::news.uk.story.23370270.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:2cec8566-c562-a04f-9ba7-00915328039e]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS]", "http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/53409000/jpg/_53409474_flanders-112x81.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68831000/jpg/_68831808_stadium_pa.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/68831000/jpg/_68831808_stadium_pa.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68831000/jpg/_68831808_stadium_pa.jpg", "date": "19/07/2013"}, "rank_14": {"title": "London 2012: Olympic legacy not felt by all", "text": "Video\n\nA report has claimed London 2012 added \u00a310bn to the UK economy, however some shop owners say the Games were bad for business.\n\nAlthough designer Tej Chuggar says the Games gave his business a cash boost, Eric Kitts from Greenwich Grocers says London 2012 has left no legacy in his area, while florist Dave Manchester says the event actually drove business away.\n\nMayor Boris Johnson said the Games had a definite \"forward momentum economically\".", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68852000/jpg/_68852476_68852149.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/media/images/68852000/jpg/_68852150_68852149.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=london::news.england.london.media_asset.23386563.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:258a22d1-3325-854a-93d1-3c2bc91cac5b]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-media-asset]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68852000/jpg/_68852476_68852149.jpg", "date": "19/07/2013"}, "rank_41": {"title": "Mayor missed long-term London Olympic jobs targets, says report", "text": "Image caption Authors said 20,000 Londoners previously without work found employment directly related to or created by the Olympics\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson has failed to deliver long-term Olympic jobs for the capital, a new report suggests.\n\nA year on, the government and the mayor say London 2012 has generated nearly \u00a310bn for the economy and led to 70,000 jobs for Londoners.\n\nBut the study, by consultants SQW, reveals failings in flagship projects set up to generate long-term jobs.

Just 12 of them were in work six months later, and none were in post after a year.\n\nThe report says one of the key aims of the project, run by private company Seetec, was meant to help people from disadvantaged groups access jobs.\n\n'Intensive support'\n\nBut not one black or ethnic minority, disabled or female employee held on to their job for more than six months.\n\nThe report said: \"Despite the scale and experience of Seetec, it did not have the in-depth knowledge of working with the economically inactive, the key target group for the project.\"\n\nThe report criticises the payment by results approach, arguing it could prevent the kind of intensive support needed for people who have not worked for long periods.\n\nIt questions whether the mayor's approach offers \"the right financial motivation to risk-averse providers to deliver both the volume and quality of post-employment support, when there is no guarantee that this will be recouped in the current economic climate.\"\n\nImage caption Plenty of jobs were created during the games\n\nA large percentage of the contractual payment is only forthcoming if people remain in their jobs for six or 12 months.\n\nNeale Coleman, the mayor's Olympic adviser, said: \"These are very difficult programmes to carry out.\n\n\"Clearly, some element of payment by results is a good discipline, but one of the things we have learned is that we shouldn't have brought this model in, nor brought it in so sharply.\n\n\"We can do this better in future. But in terms of the employment and skills generated during the games themselves, we deserve credit.\"\n\nA second mayoral jobs initiative - the Host Borough project - was set up to target long-term unemployed in the six Olympic boroughs.\n\nIt has fared better than the London-wide project, but the report says it has also under-performed.\n\nMr Johnson promised it would get 5,000 people into work.\n\n'Need to improve'\n\nSo far 2,026 have been helped, with a little over half of those still in their jobs six months later and 735 in employment after a year.\n\nThe report says the projects \"need to improve their performance, especially in terms of translating job entry starts into sustained employment outcomes\".\n\nIt found the commitment of the government and mayor to get 70,000 jobless people into work as a result of the Olympics had been met.\n\nIt says 20,000 Londoners - previously without work - found employment directly related to or created by the Olympics.\n\nBut the analysis accepted job creation figures included jobs only indirectly related to the Olympics - such as those created at Stratford's Westfield centre - with some likely to have existed irrespective of the games.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=london::news.england.london.story.23371731.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:084811e6-63f6-0844-9d0d-3b3159a0360a]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/68833000/jpg/_68833399_stadium_pa.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68833000/jpg/_68833399_stadium_pa.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68833000/jpg/_68833399_stadium_pa.jpg", "date": "19/07/2013"}, "rank_13": {"title": "Olympic legacy on school sport 'on life support'", "text": "Image caption Mo Farah's Olympic performance was voted the most inspiring of the London Games\n\nThe Olympic legacy on school sport is \"on life support\" and more needs to be done to ensure it lasts beyond two years, MPs say.\n\nThe Commons Education Committee says many schools lacked facilities and that this limited opportunities for youngsters to get involved in sport.\n\nWithout wide experience of sport in school many elite athletes would not have discovered their talent, they add.\n\nThe government said schools would have \u00a3300m to spend on PE over two years.\n\nMPs on the committee say funding systems should be changed to enable long-term investment.\n\nThe committee highlighted the fact that the London Games was the first \"where the notion of legacy was built into the initial bid\".\n\nLack of facilities\n\nBut some said the \"opportunity to inspire a generation and build on the success\" of the Olympics had been \"missed\", while another described it as \"on life support\".\n\nIf the government want to capitalise on the legacy of London 2012 it must commit to funding for the long-term Graham Stuart, Committee chairman\n\nAlthough there was a surge in interest in sports, the committee heard, it did not translate into \"people turning up at clubs\".\n\nThe School Games, in which schools compete against each other from local to national level, was pointed to by some witnesses as a good example of the Olympic Legacy.\n\nBut there were concerns that it only appealed to talented athletes and that not all children would be able to take part.\n\nAnd it was pointed out that the School Games needed much more guaranteed funding for it to last as a legacy.\n\nThe committee also heard concerns about the lack of sporting facilities in schools, with swimming pools highlighted as a particular problem.\n\nOne east London school, Plashet School, stressed how important it was that local people got to use the facilities of the Olympic Park, such as the aquatics centre.\n\n'Short-term fixes'\n\nThe head teacher of a school in Cornwall talked about the difficulties of rural schools like hers getting access to facilities at all.\n\nHowever, ministers insisted that more than 1,000 facilities had already been upgraded, but admitted more needed to be done.\n\nThe committee also heard from elite athletes how important it was for young people to access a broad range of sports so that they could see whether they were good at an activity or not.\n\nThe committee concluded that the chance to realise a legacy of the Games had not yet been lost, further action needed to ensure it lasted into the future.\n\nCommittee chairman Graham Stuart said: \"High quality school sport is vitally important.

'Inspire a generation' is any generation.\n\n\"From the Paralympic point of view, they were talking about the awareness of disability and how that it could have an impact in a positive way.\n\n\"There were a lot of things that we hoped the Paralympics would do. There was a huge amount of pressure on the Games to have this change of people's attitudes towards disability and women's sport.\n\n\"We've seen a huge amount of women's sport gaining coverage.

What we need to do is make sure all the funding that's available goes into the right areas.\n\n\"It's not very easy [financially] at the moment and that's why, for example, volunteers are crucial. We saw that during the Olympic Games and we need to continue that theme so that sport is delivered at every level in Trafford.\n\n\"If we deliver sport, it has that knock-on effect and it has many benefits. We, as a council, have to make sure we have all the right people in the right places to deliver it.\"", "images":

Team sports only have one medal available but for individual sports there are a lot more - how can that be fair?\"\n\nVolleyball has been included in the Olympic programme for men and women since debuting at Tokyo in 1964. Over thirty years later, at the Atlanta Olympics of 1996, two-person beach volleyball was also introduced.\n\nBut last summer's Games was the first time Great Britain had entered a team in either format of the sport.\n\n\"I've been so disappointed with the whole legacy aspect because that was meant to be one of the biggest things to come from the Olympics,\" Wicks, from Dorset, continued.\n\n\"Volleyball is still so new in Britain, it's a development sport. Yet worldwide it is the sport with the highest participation levels amongst women, whilst also being widely played by men - we are still playing catch-up.\"\n\nAt London 2012, all four Team GB teams were eliminated in the group stages - Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin did also play in the 'lucky loser' round for a place in the knockout stage of the beach volleyball but lost to the Austrian pair.\n\nBefore the Olympics, each Great Britain team was set a target by UK Sport for having its funding renewed. The volleyball team's target was for one of the indoor teams to win one match, something achieved by the women's side in beating Algeria 3-2.\n\nHowever, that target came with the caveat \"maximum expectation\", stipulating one beach volleyball pair must finish in the top 10 and one indoor team in the top eight - both goals they failed to achieve.\n\n\"The problem with UK Sport is that they have a no-compromise approach to funding,\" remarked Wicks.\n\n\"They say you need to achieve 'x, y and z'. What I find baffling is that, as a team, we achieved 'x, y and z' and got nothing for it.\n\n\"People are becoming really excited about volleyball but now there is not going to be a system in place for people to go out and play at the highest level.\"\n\nIn a change in priorities, UK Sport slashed its funding of volleyball post-2012 and instead Sport England - whose remit is to develop grassroots sport - pledged \u00a35.1m towards creating a new generation of players over the next four-year Olympic cycle. external-link\n\nBut the lack of opportunities for elite players in Britain has led to the likes of Wicks, Team GB's vice-captain at the London Olympics, playing professionally in Central and Eastern Europe, with the 31-year-old based in Germany at Alemannia Aachen.\n\nThe Poole-born player only started playing volleyball in 1998 at the age of 16, and less than a year later she was representing England at youth level.\n\n\"Grassroots-wise it's fantastic that people can go out and try volleyball,\" she added.\n\n\"Developing team sports for children especially is really important because the skills you learn are different to just playing individual sport.\n\n\"But you can't put all the money in one end of the sport. It shouldn't all go to performance either, but there has to be some put into the elite.\n\n\"At the moment there is no England senior team.

TfL was very successful in doing that (some argue too successful), but is there a legacy?\n\nImage caption Social media has become a greater tool to give warnings and advice on alternative routes\n\nTfL's bill to London 2012 of \u00a3410m included staff bonuses.\n\nBut in real terms \u00a3228m was invested in new Olympic infrastructure like the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) to Stratford and the new DLR stations like Stratford High Street.\n\nHome working\n\nWe now have accessibility ramps at a lot more stations due to the Paralympics.\n\nThe latest TfL figures also show there has been a slight change in commuter habits.\n\nBefore the Games 13% of commuters worked from home at least one day a week, during the Games that increased to 26%. Now 20% of commuters are working from home at least once a week.\n\nWhether that was solely down to the Olympics it is very difficult to say.\n\nWhat has also changed is how TfL now communicates with travellers. It calls it TDM - Travel Demand Management.\n\nSo, if London Bridge is being closed it will use social media, the web and adverts to try to get commuters to use other routes.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if travellers become less receptive and get message fatigue.\n\nThe Olympics was huge - lots and lots of Wembleys all on the same day for two weeks Michelle Dix, Transport for London\n\nAlso, when it comes to big events TfL and the train operators are far more co-ordinated than they used to be.\n\n'Behavioural change'\n\nThere is an event management desk in Palestra (a building in Southwark) to co-ordinate transport.\n\nThe next time it will be used will be for Ride London 100 on 3 and 4 August when all the bridges will be shut in Central London.\n\nMichelle Dix from TfL said: \"That's the biggest legacy in terms of behavioural change.\n\n\"We proved that through messaging and communications and telling people what's going on, telling them about alternatives so they can make informed choices, we proved that you can manage these big events.\n\n\"The Olympics was huge - lots and lots of Wembleys all on the same day for two weeks - a huge process of managing people and what we've learnt is you can do that for other sustained events such as London Bridge.\n\n\"London Bridge is going to be completely refigured over the next eight years. There's going to be disruption at the station and what we're doing is applying those lessons of communication.\"\n\nBut one of the real legacies is for transport organisations.\n\nThey have successfully put on the biggest event in the world.\n\nYes of course there will be problems in the future - but Londoners now expect high standards from their transport system all the year round.\n\nIf transport operators can do it for the Games - why not?", "images": ["https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.311.03563/img/correspondents/circles/tomedwards.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/62398000/jpg/_62398924_games_lane.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=london::news.england.london.correspondent_story.23435006.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:2d626cd5-6f79-8b46-a2b2-6aecbf5b70d6]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62398000/jpg/_62398924_games_lane.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/62398000/jpg/_62398924_games_lane.jpg", "date": "26/07/2013"}, "rank_5": {"title": "London 2012: Has Britain made the most of its Olympic legacy?", "text": "Sebastian Coe told the BBC's Today programme on Friday that the legacy from last year's Olympics is already \"profound\".\n\nForty-six weeks on from the Games he said school sport, the economy, volunteering and the main Olympic venues had all made a good start.\n\nBut he acknowledged, rightly, that there is still a long way to go.\n\nAs London's Olympic Stadium prepares to welcome back big crowds for the Anniversary Games this weekend, it is inevitable that people will ask questions about whether London 2012 is on track to deliver on its legacy promises.\n\nIt is worth remembering that no Olympic host city has ever tried to do what London is doing.\n\nAt a time when they are being squeezed, the government needs to think about whether it is doing enough to ensure there are courts and pitches to play on\n\nSydney wasted the best part of a decade working out what to do with the Olympic Park at Homebush while Barcelona's use of the iconic diving pool and aquatics centre for this week's World Championships is a notable one off. Beijing's Olympic Stadium is essentially a tourist attraction.\n\nSo, to sell out the Olympic Stadium for three days exactly one year on from the London Games is a real achievement.\n\nAs I took the all too familiar walk from Westfield to the stadium earlier this week it was impossible to miss the amount of work already completed or under way.\n\nThe temporary stands bolted on to architect Zaha Hadid's aquatics centre have been removed revealing the venue in all its curvaceous beauty. One side is partially glazed and when finished it's sure to become the iconic building on the Olympic Park (yes, even better than the velodrome).\n\nAs you approach the stadium you have to walk through a building site. There can't be a clearer message of how London has not wasted any time in transforming the park.\n\nOnce inside the stadium it feels like the last 12 months never happened. The Olympic cauldron and the flags have gone, of course, but it is still an inspiring place and packed with 80,000 people it is sure to revive memories of those thrilling days and nights last summer.\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Olympic sports' sponsorship struggle\n\nThis will be the last time the stadium looks like this. After the summer work will begin on turning it into West Ham's new home. And with the other seven venues on the park now moving into legacy mode, there is little room for nostalgia.\n\nBut while the venues and the park might be making good progress, concerns over the 'soft' legacy - the task of transforming our sporting habits - remain.\n\nTellingly Coe did not mention participation on the Today programme. That could have simply been a factor of live radio but it may also have reflected the fact that despite the 1.4m increase in adults regularly playing sport since 2005 (when London won the bid to stage the Games) the picture since last summer is mixed.\n\nOn Friday the BBC published the results of a poll conducted by ComRes. It found 11% of adults said they were playing sport more regularly because of the Games.\n\nHow is one to view that? Is 11% a sign of things going in the right direction? Or is it a bit underwhelming considering the biggest leap in interest and commitment would come in the immediate aftermath of the Games.\n\nThe most recent findings from Sport England's Active People survey suggests it may be the latter. The report said there had been a 200,000 drop in the number of adults playing sport since the Games.\n\nThe fall was blamed on the harsh winter, but whatever the excuses the idea there should be a decrease in people playing sport after such a successful home Olympics can't be good.\n\n27% of people in Scotland believe the Olympics have had a positive effect on sports facilities in their area. That compares to 39% in Northern Ireland and 36% in Wales.\n\nOne in four (24%) of those aged 18-24 say they are more active as a result of the Games. Read the full BBC survey on Olympic legacy\n\nSo what's the answer? At the moment the government is empowering sports governing bodies to drive up grassroots participation and withholding lottery money from those who don't deliver. Tennis, for example, has been told it won't get all its funding unless they show they are making progress in this area.\n\nThis is the same hard-headed approach that worked so well for our elite sportsmen and women. If sports don't produce medals, they get less funding. Simple as that. This has to be the right approach.\n\nBut it's also a question of facilities and in most cases that comes down to local authority budgets. At a time when they are being squeezed, the government needs to think about whether it is doing enough to ensure there are courts and pitches to play on.\n\nA number of people have written to me flagging up cuts and closures which contradict the overarching commitment to increasing grassroots participation.\n\nCould more money be found or another way of releasing good facilities for wider community use? A lot of good work is already happening in this area, but, as ever, more could be done.\n\nWorryingly, it seemed to me that after the Games there was a lack of real drive around this issue. The moment the Olympics and Paralympics ended there was no nationwide campaign telling people how they could take up sports they had just watched or urging them to get more active.\n\nThat was a missed opportunity but given the recent run of sporting success, perhaps it's not too late.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=olympics::sport.olympics.correspondent_story.23467773.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:f26504c0-6a3a-ac44-a9ce-26d68b4f710b]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_PS]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/68969000/gif/_68969308_stadium.gif", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/mcs/media/images/68970000/gif/_68970474_stadium.gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/activity-guide.jpg", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/64016000/jpg/_64016140_david-bond_144x81.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired-logo.svg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/68969000/gif/_68969308_stadium.gif", "date": "26/07/2013"}, "rank_106": {"title": "Pentathlon 'proved point at London'", "text": "Team GB's modern pentathlon director Jan Bartu tells BBC Points West the sport earned the right to remain in the Olympics with its success at London 2012.\n\nThe event, first held at the 1912 Games, was one of several at risk of being excluded from future Olympics.\n\nAfter the performance of all 26 sports at London 2012 was assessed by the International Olympic Committee, it was decided wrestling would be dropped from 2020.\n\nAnd Bartu believes Samantha Murray's silver medal for Team GB, plus the reaction of the sell-out crowds that watched the event in London, proved it deserved to keep its status.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/320/cpsprodpb/1572E/production/_111345878_gettyimages-629524380.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/320/cpsprodpb/1125A/production/_111343207_gettyimages-1211900827.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/320/cpsprodpb/14BDA/production/_111345948_gettyimages-960476772.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/320/cpsprodpb/9F4F/production/_111338704_kjtgetty.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/mcs/media/images/68945000/jpg/_68945505_bartu_getty.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/320/cpsprodpb/3C68/production/_111346451_gettyimages-955258330.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/320/mcs/media/images/68952000/jpg/_68952043_bartu_sg.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=modern_pentathlon::sport.modern_pentathlon.media_asset.23455675.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:a5fc5b31-ec33-ef41-90b8-cf6936fc8832]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-media-asset]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_GNL]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/320/cpsprodpb/48DE/production/_111345681_19612058.jpg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/mcs/media/images/68945000/jpg/_68945505_bartu_getty.jpg", "date": "26/07/2013"}, "rank_58": {"title": "London 2012: Has Leicestershire Olympic legacy 'gone'?", "text": "Image caption England cricketers James Taylor and Stuart Broad and Rugby World Cup winner Neil Back all hail from Melton Mowbray\n\nThe town of Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire is probably better known for its pies than its athletes.\n\nBut dig a little deeper and you'll find a number of inspirational sporting figures hail from the area: England cricketers Stuart Broad and James Taylor, Rugby World Cup winner Neil Back and British Olympics equestrian hopeful Lauren Shannon among them.\n\nIf people from Melton want to play a game of squash, they have to travel to Grantham, Nottingham or Oakham Alan Webster, Ex-professional footballer and coach\n\nThe one thing you won't find in the town, however, is a leisure centre.\n\nUntil a few years ago, the town was dependant on facilities provided by two of its schools.\n\nBut when one school closed and the other college started redeveloping its sports complex, the shortage of alternatives seemed stark.\n\nA recent refurbishment of Melton's Waterfield Leisure Pool has been viewed with mixed feelings by residents.\n\nAlison Bowland, chair of the town's swimming club said: \"One of the pools was filled in and made into a fitness studio.

It helped bring focus to this project.\"\n\nMr Pearson said plans were under way which would mean Melton would get its leisure centre.\n\nIt would include five-aside football and indoor cricket facilities, a climbing wall, fitness studios, outdoor pitches plus a netball and basketball hall with space for 1,000 spectators, he said.\n\nThere would also be space allocated for a possible swimming pool, should it be required in the future.\n\nMr Pearson said a number of sites were currently being considered in the town but he hoped the facility would be up and running in two or three years.\n\nAnd time is of the essence, if the town is to capitalise on the Olympic legacy.\n\n\"There needs to be massive focus from the government,\" he said.\n\n\"We need children playing sport in primary schools three or four times a week. We've got to do it quickly, or the next 20 years, we're in real trouble.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the borough council confirmed funding options were being considered.\n\nImage caption Loughborough University plans to open an \u00a38m campus on the Olympic park site\n\nIn many towns, however, the grand ambitions inspired by the Olympics do not seem to have been realised.\n\nAccording to a BBC survey, four out of five people think the games have neither boosted the local economy or public services.\n\nAnd only about one in 10 thought the 2012 Olympics inspired people to become more physically active.\n\nIn which case, does an Olympic legacy actually exist?\n\n\"It's hard to say what the legacy is,\" said Paul Jacobs, head of physical education at Melton's John Ferneley College.\n\n\"There have been a lot of schemes floating around but I don't see there's been a lot of difference.\n\n\"At school level, I wouldn't say I have had more students involved in sport this year than there were last year.\"\n\nLoughborough uplift\n\nGaynor Nash is an Olympic legacy officer and goes into schools around the county to speak about how to develop an activity programme.\n\n\"Some schools have done nothing,\" she said. \"I feel like I am totally reminding them about the Olympics - it's gone. Some schools have been terrific but others have dragged their feet.\"\n\nPerhaps where the Olympics have made a difference has been at encouraging those already sports-focused to aim high.\n\nLoughborough University, which is building an \u00a38m campus for postgraduates at the Olympic Park in London, has seen an uplift in student applications for its sports degrees.\n\nDirector of sport Peter Keen said: \"For me, the Olympics was a lesson in self-belief,\" he said. \"If we put our mind to something we can do extraordinary things. That's the legacy from London.\"\n\nCulture secretary Maria Miller, who visited the university this week added: \"The new facilities really put this university in Loughborough as central to Britain's success in the future too.\"\n\nBut if the benefits of sport are to extend beyond the sporting elite to the population at large, parish councillor Mr Webster believes top-class facilities are key.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is, there is a lot of work to be done,\" he said. \"And that starts with giving people the right facilities. People will demand those - at the very least.\"", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/68987000/jpg/_68987916_melton.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68987000/jpg/_68987916_melton.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=leicester::news.england.leicester.story.23451501.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:b8ac4540-8230-4c41-bd86-3dd53e313b9d]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/68987000/jpg/_68987916_melton.jpg", "date": "29/07/2013"}, "rank_48": {"title": "Inaugural London cycle race 'does not fulfil Olympic legacy'", "text": "Ride London\n\nVenue: London, England Date: 3-4 August Coverage: Sunday, 4 August live on BBC One (16:30), BBC Sport website, mobiles, tablets and Connected TVs.\n\nSome of the world's best cyclists will take to the roads of London this weekend for the inaugural RideLondon.\n\nBut a leading female cyclist has been critical of the organisers' decision to host an elite men's road race but not an equivalent for women.\n\nRideLondon cycling festival Saturday, 3 August, 09:00-16:00 BST: Eight-mile ride through central London, where the roads will be closed for up to 50,000 people to take part. 18:30: Women's criterium - a city centre loop for professional women cyclists.

150 minutes a week.\n\nComparisons with previous years are complicated because the way exercise levels are measured has changed, but everything points to a gradual increase in the past few years.\n\nReal risk\n\nBut dig a little deeper and the figures are not so rosy.\n\nThe data, drawn from Sport England's Active People Survey, shows that there are also significant numbers of people doing very little exercise.\n\nIn total, almost a third are failing to do 30 minutes a week.\n\nThere is a real risk that any progress we make in terms of persuading more people to be more active will be strangled at birth James Stibbs, Sport and Recreation Alliance\n\nQuestions are also raised by other data compiled by the organisation, which suggests participation in organised sport fell by 200,000 to 15.3m in the past year.\n\nParticipation in football, cricket, rugby and cycling all decreased, with only tennis and swimming among the nation's most popular pursuits recording a rise.\n\nSome of that can be blamed on the poor weather over the winter, but nonetheless there is a real risk that the health legacy will not materialise without a change in fortunes.\n\nMinisters have attempted to intervene by announcing an extra \u00a35m of funding this week.\n\nSqueezed budgets\n\nThe pot is to be split between walking initiatives, Change 4 Life, the government's healthy lifestyles programme, and Street Play, which encourages children and families to reclaim the streets by playing old favourites such as hide-and-seek and hopscotch.\n\nThis comes on top of a host of initiatives already announced, including the Schools Games scheme, in which schools compete against each other from local to national level, and a \u00a3135m Sport England programme, which is investing in sports facilities and co-ordinators up and down the country.\n\nBut this has to be seen against the backdrop of an unprecedented squeeze on the budgets of one of the key providers of leisure facilities - local government.\n\nThere are about 150,000 amateur sports clubs in the country - two-thirds of which do not own their own facilities and rely largely on the availability of council-funded services.\n\nJames Stibbs, of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, says he is concerned.\n\n'On life support'\n\n\"Councils are being asked to make big cuts and there's concern that the worst of these are yet to kick in.\n\n\"There is a real risk that any progress we make in terms of persuading more people to be more active will be strangled at birth.\"\n\nSchools are also struggling, its seems.\n\nLast month the House of Commons Education Select Committee warned that the Olympic legacy on school sport was \"on life support\".\n\nThe MPs said many schools lacked facilities, which limited opportunities for youngsters to get involved.\n\nIt may be early days -

and how about just trying to be a normal young person? How do you balance training, school work and your social life?\n\nI've been able to look into these issues for a special BBC Radio 1 documentary as part of the Radio 1 Stories documentary strand.\n\nMaking the documentary was a great learning experience as I heard from Usain Bolt, Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Greg Rutherford, Gemma Gibbons, the Brownlee brothers, Karina Bryant and quite a few more about what it takes to make it to the top of the podium.\n\nBut I also discovered how hard it is to grow up attempting to become an elite athlete, thanks to the touching stories of four people who are smashing down barriers to follow their Olympic dream.\n\nThere's Aaron Turner, a 21-year-old judoka who struggles to make ends meet with the cost of training.\n\nInspiration Generation 27% of people in Scotland believe the Olympics have had a positive effect on sports facilities in their area.

My only training had been momentary jogging spurts, (endorphin chasing, I call it), a 'one lap' jog around my local patch of grass.\n\nTo give myself the tiniest bit of credit, I do sometimes go to the gym - my trainer their calls me 'Bambi' as my balancing ability is abysmal.\n\nSome people at the gym think I'm unhinged because I'll often be vocally repeating the mantra of finding life's 'balance'.

It lifted me and forced me not to stop.\n\nThe velocity of sport in numbers I find giddy. There is a new high to be found in looking after yourself and engaging in sport and fitness.\n\nIn the UK 1.4 million more people are playing sport regularly since the bid to host the Olympics was won in 2005. If there was a 'well-being revolution' gently rumbling along over the past five years, then last year's Olympics jolted us all into action.\n\nSport became the new rock 'n' roll, with its stars our new idols.

Hopes were high for a positive legacy but a charity today says that disabled people are still waiting.\n\nLord Coe's closing speech at London 2012 drew attention to the Paralympic legacy. \"I really genuinely think we have had a seismic effect in shifting public attitudes,\" he said. \"I don't think people will ever see sport the same way again, I don't think they will ever see disability in the same way again.\"\n\nThe charity Scope today suggests a less than seismic shift. In a poll of 1000 disabled people, 81% say that public attitudes haven't improved in the last 12 months - in fact, 22% say they've got worse. The overwhelming majority of this latter group blame \"benefit scrounger\" rhetoric from politicians and the media.\n\nDisability poll The recent poll of disabled people commissioned by charity Scope found: Nearly one in five (17%) of disabled people report they have either experienced hostile or threatening behaviour or even been attacked\n\n81% of disabled people say that attitudes towards them haven't improved in the last twelve months\n\n22% say that things have actually got worse\n\n84% say the 'benefit scrounger' rhetoric from politicians and the media has had a negative effect on views of disabled people\n\nAnother new survey by Leonard Cheshire Disability claims that more than one in five disabled people say that intimidation and abuse prevent them from going out.\n\nThis time last year we were watching giant apples, disabled dancers suspended in mid-air doing an umbrella routine and scientist Stephen Hawking, all live from the stadium in an opening ceremony that made people sit up and pay attention. Lest we forget, it felt like disabled people were taking over the UK, with their sports taken seriously, huge crowds in the park and something new and positive in the air.\n\nThe Paralympics coverage by Channel 4 went on to win the TV Bafta for best sport and live event, despite strong competition from the BBC.\n\nBut the games took place against a backdrop of cuts to disability benefits, and a feeling of underlying dissent was apparent from the very start. The opening ceremony featured a choreographed protest symbolising the struggle towards disability rights.\n\nThere were protests during the games against the involvement of Atos, the company which at the time ran the government's work capability assessment (WCA) process. This controversial programme determines whether people are fit for work or eligible for disability allowance. The government says it allows those who need help to be better targeted. But disabled campaigners said that WCA was \"damaging and distressing\". Some athletes reportedly hid lanyards printed with the Atos logo in protest.\n\nDisabled People Against Cuts (DPAC) are holding a week's worth of protests on the anniversary. DPAC's Linda Burnip says the legacy is going to become meaningless as benefit cuts begin to kick in and materially affect the lives of disabled people. She hopes that a visit this week to the UK by the United Nations special rapporteur (special representative) on housing, may bring about change. \"In October a second rapporteur is meeting with us around the subject of care support funding, WCA and closure of the independent living fund,\" says Burnip.\n\nThe jury's also out on another legacy goal - public transport accessibility. The campaign group Transport For All (TFA) is unhappy that seven stations on the new Crossrail route through London will not be step-free. It's holding a legacy torch relay today along the route of the line, which is still under construction.\n\nThe sheen may be wearing off our memory of the Games, but there is a consensus that from a sporting point of view, the event was a runaway success. Elite disability sport is now taken seriously in a way few commentators had expected, and Johnnie Peacock, Ellie Simmonds and David Weir - to name a few - have become household names.\n\nThe team behind London 2012 hoped that the Olympic and Paralympic Games would \"inspire a generation\".\n\nIn July, Sebastian Coe called for a 10-year legacy plan and then resigned as the government's Olympic legacy ambassador. He felt that a positive legacy was more likely to happen without him as people assumed he held all responsibility.\n\nPreviously from Ouch! \"The tone was set for a showcase of inclusion and diversity, which appeared to strike the difficult balance between inspiring the masses and eliciting pride and solidarity amongst even the most critical disabled commentators,\" writes Emma Tracey on the Paralympics opening ceremony .\n\nAt the end of the Games last year, veteran Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson urged everyone to keep the momentum up, saying: \"You can't wait for someone else to do legacy, you've got to take a bit of responsibility for yourself.\"\n\nDisabled people are still celebrating the spirit of the Paralympics, Martyn Sibley who co-edits the online magazine Disability Horizons, will soon be travelling in his powered wheelchair from John O'Groats to Land's End for the Britain's Personal Best project. He says he's making the journey because he doesn't want the light to go out.\n\nAnd Alexa Wilson from Wiltshire has seen this kind of do-it-yourself legacy in action. She is mum to 12-year-old Ellie who has autism. She says that in her experience, the Paralympics have given a new and helpful focus to people who want to do something positive for her daughter's school and that Ellie is already benefiting.\n\n\"Often in the past people didn't know what to do to help,\" she says. \"They knew they wanted to do something for the local special school and we've had fantastic help before, but now they're coming forward with opportunities for the children to go sailing, for instance.\n\n\"Rather than donating some shrubs to the sensory garden which they did the year before last, they're now suggesting doing something sporty - thanks to the Paralympics. That's inclusive and healthy too. It's not like the children only want to wander round the sensory garden all day.\"\n\nYou can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook, and listen to our monthly talk show", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/69522000/jpg/_69522365_151663289.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/69522000/jpg/_69522365_151663289.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=blogs::ouch::news.blogs.ouch.story.23861941.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:0cd0af4d-3038-924b-84d9-290e3daf5f86]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/69522000/jpg/_69522365_151663289.jpg", "date": "29/08/2013"}, "rank_140": {"title": "Christine Ohuruogu out to inspire 'Olympic legacy defenders'", "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device Behind-the-scenes as Denise Lewis up with world athletics champion Christine Ohuruogu\n\nInspire: The Olympic Journey - BBC One, Saturday 19 October, 13:15 BST.

I didn't even watch track and field on TV - I just knew people like Linford Christie and Colin Jackson did stuff and won golds.\n\n\"If the kids can just remember one thing I say and tell that to somebody else, that's how things work - little things lead to big things.\"\n\nOhuruogu said being a celebrity is \"just not her\" and prefers to try to inspire youngsters in other ways.\n\n\"There's no point in being blessed if you're not passing it on, not showing other people how to be better or how to do better,\" she said.\n\n\"I like to get my hands dirty, to see what's happening - that's how I enjoy myself.\n\n\"Nothing is more fulfilling than when you tell a kid something and you can see them thinking: 'That's what I'm gonna do.'

I am going to spend the next few months applying for funding and contacting possible sponsors, and see how much I can raise.\"\n\n'New city'\n\nThe LLDC said the project was a test case to see how it could develop facilities within the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park when its residential areas open.\n\nEleanor Fawcett, the LLDC's head of design and physical regeneration, said: \"The reason why this kind of a project is important to us is because the challenge we have been set is to really build a new piece of city, a new piece of east London, and that's something that's going to take time.\n\n\"And I think it's these sorts of projects which are actually going to start to help people to understand that legacy isn't some distant concept, but is about creating spaces for

all athletes must be no more than an hour from the host city.\n\n\"With regards to the economics, it's not just a question of the direct business that came out, it's a question of tourism where over

"text": "A major parliamentary report into the London 2012 Olympics warns that the prospect of an \"effective and robust\" legacy from the Games is in jeopardy unless there is a change in government approach.\n\nThe House of Lords Select Committee on Olympic and Paralympic Legacy says the Games were an \"outstanding success\", but urges the government to appoint a minister with overall responsibility for producing legacy benefits which, it warns, \"are in danger of faltering\".\n\nThe report finds \"little evidence\" of increased participation in sport, highlights the uneven distribution of economic benefits of the Games across the UK, and also criticises funding body UK Sport for its 'no compromise' policy on sports without short-term medal prospects.\n\n[UK Sport's funding] approach has an inherent bias against team sports, and fails to help emerging sport Lord Harris of Haringey\n\n\"It is clear to everyone that the Olympic and Paralympic Games were an outstanding success,\" said the committee chairman, Lord Harris of Haringey.\n\n\"However, since the Games, the same political impetus and agreed deadlines no longer exist and many aspects of legacy are in danger of faltering, whilst some have fallen by the wayside.\n\n\"There is confusion on the timeframes and targets involved in delivery and a lack of clear ownership of legacy as a whole.\"\n\nThe committee, which took evidence from Mayor of London Boris Johnson, former Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell, and former Games organising committee chairman Lord Coe among others, recommended that a minister be given responsibility for the Olympic legacy, enabling greater co-ordination across Whitehall departments.\n\nIt also believes the Mayor of London should be given control over further development of east London and the Olympic Park in Stratford.\n\nAnd there is a stark warning over the geographic disparity across the UK in the economic benefits stemming from the Games.\n\nGovernment figures state that \u00a32.5bn of additional foreign direct investment had been secured since the Games, resulting in 31,000 new jobs.\n\nBut while London and the south-east of England benefited with nearly 15,000 additional jobs, just seven were created in the North East.\n\nLondon 2012 may have promised to \"inspire a generation\" but the committee of cross-party peers says it found \"little evidence [of a] step change\" in sports participation levels across the UK.\n\n\"Whilst some sports have performed well, many others were unprepared for capturing the enthusiasm of the Games,\" added Lord Harris.\n\n\"We call on the government urgently to develop action plans to ensure the forthcoming decade of major sports events can be leveraged to create the step change.\"\n\nThe committee also called on the Department for Education to give greater emphasis to PE in schools and to ensure teachers had the necessary training.\n\nUK Sport, the body that invests approximately \u00a3100m in high-performance athletes and teams each year and decides funding levels for Olympic and Paralympic sports, is also criticised in the report.\n\nFollowing London 2012, 18 sports were given increases in funding.\n\nFive, including swimming, had their budgets cut - with volleyball suffering an 88% reduction in its allocation after all four Team GB teams were eliminated in the Olympic group stages last year.\n\nBut the committee believes not enough is being done by UK Sport to help both team and emerging sports.\n\n\"The 'no compromise' approach of UK Sport has delivered medals for Team GB and has clearly improved top-end importance,\" said Lord Harris.\n\n\"This approach, however, has an inherent bias against team sports, and fails to help emerging sports, some of which, such as handball and volleyball, generated real enthusiasm at London 2012.\n\n\"It is not a one-size-fits-all approach for all sports, and we make the case for a different approach to be applied to developing sports that have less prospect of short-term medal success.\"\n\nUK Sport said it would be working on a full response to the report with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.\n\n\"UK Sport's 'No Compromise' approach is about getting the right support to the right athletes for the right reasons over an eight-year investment cycle,\" a statement from the funding body

used to the full' - Lords report", "text": "Image caption West Ham games are due to be held at the Olympic Stadium from August 2016\n\nThe Olympic Stadium is not being used as well as it should be, according to a group of Lords who also questioned the legacy of London 2012.\n\nThe House of Lords Committee on Games Legacy said the \u00a3429m stadium was a \"national asset that should be used to the full\".\n\nBut it remained \"unconvinced\" that present arrangements would deliver an \"effective and robust\" legacy.\n\nThe government said it remained committed to building on the Games.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the Olympics and Paralympics were an \"outstanding success\" the report also calls on the government to appoint a minister to take overall responsibility for delivering legacy benefits.\n\nThe major examination of London's legacy efforts by a cross-party committee of peers claims political impetus has been lost and there is a \"lack of ownership\" from the government over building on the opportunities the Games provided.\n\n'A farce'\n\nThe report's authors say there are no white elephants among 2012 facilities but there is \"little evidence\" that a step-change in sport participation levels has materialised - a key pledge from London's bid for the Games.\n\nThere is also criticism over the geographical spread of the economic benefits - with foreign investment as a result of London 2012 resulting in 15,000 jobs for the south-east, but just seven in the north-east.\n\nAnd it said there may have been too many \"closed minds\" about potential options for how the Olympic Stadium could be used.\n\nPlanned or possible future events West Ham United home games from 2016\n\nMatches in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, being staged in England\n\n2017 World Athletics Championships\n\nLondon Diamond League athletics meetings\n\nTwenty20 cricket matches\n\n2022 Commonwealth Games\n\nRock concerts\n\nWest Ham United was chosen to be the anchor tenant of the 80,000 capacity venue, which is set to be turned into a 54,000-seater stadium in time for the 2016-17 season.\n\nThe east London club has been awarded a 99-year lease on the stadium in Stratford.\n\nThis summer, the venue staged a sell-out athletics meeting on the weekend of the first anniversary of the start the 2012 Olympics.\n\nPop concerts, 2015 Rugby World Cup matches, the 2017 World Athletics Championships, and future London Diamond League athletics meetings are all set to take place there after the reconstruction work.\n\nEssex County Cricket Club has suggested it could play Twenty20 games at the stadium and earlier this year a bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games was mooted.\n\nBut last November the chairman of UK Athletics, Ed Warner, said he had expected the stadium to reopen in 2014 and branded the delay to 2015 or 2016 \"a farce\".\n\nLeyton Orient wanted to share the use of the stadium and the League One club had applied at the High Court to have a judicial review of the decision to award it to the Hammers but this was refused.\n\n'Squabble not helpful'\n\nLord Harris, chairman of the Lords committee, said the clubs were acting \"like children squabbling over who goes down the slide first as far as the stadium is concerned\".\n\n\"We urge those concerned to think further on how the two most local football clubs might work together, including whether any difficulties can be ameliorated through wider community use of the stadium, which may include its occasional use by Leyton Orient FC if appropriate financial arrangement can be agreed,\" he said.\n\nImage caption The park around the stadium is to be called the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\nIn its report, titled Keeping The Flame Alive, the committee said: \"Our feeling is that the stadium is a national asset.\n\n\"There has been very substantial investment in the facilities. Given that this is a national asset and the focus should be on making the best use of it for the community, this squabble is not helpful.\n\n\"At the moment our concern is that there are too many closed minds about this.\"\n\nLord Harris added: \"At the moment I think all we have heard is people's negotiating position rather than a serious attempt to reach a compromise.\"\n\nLeyton Orient welcomed the report. Chairman Barry Hearn said: \"I agree with the House of Lords recommendation - ourselves, West Ham and the LLDC should sit down and work this out together once and for all.\"\n\nThe club said it would seek a meeting with the LLDC to discuss \"what part we can play in the future use of the Olympic Stadium\".\n\nA spokesman for West Ham said the club was focused on \"creating a stunning new home for the club and its supporters in 2016, alongside a long-term legacy for the community of east London\".\n\n\"What goes on with other interested parties is very much a matter for (Leyton Orient) and the LLDC, and not West Ham United,\" he said.\n\n'Blueprint' for future Games\n\nThe committee also said time frames and targets were confused and the political drive which helped to make the Games a success had now fallen by the wayside.\n\nAs well as suggesting the appointment of a legacy benefits minister, the peers also called for the Department for Transport to try to secure international train services at Stratford International station, in order to generate a return on the substantial investment made there.\n\nA Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"The government remains committed to building on the legacy created from hosting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to benefit the entire country for generations to come.\n\n\"Our legacy has been hailed by the International Olympic Committee as a 'blueprint' for future Games and over the next 10 years we aim to use the inspiration of 2012 to deliver lasting change in sport, communities, the economy, east London and awareness and perceptions around disability.\"", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=",

Apr2012-Apr2013 Oct2012-Oct2013 Change Source: Sport England's Active People Survey Swimming 2.88m 2.93m Increase Athletics 1.95m 2.02m Increase Cycling 1.86m 2m Increase Football 1.94m 1.84m Decrease Golf 771,000 751,000 Decrease Tennis 423,400 400,600 Decrease Squash 257,100 240,700 Decrease Rugbyunion 166,000 159,600 Decrease Boxing 149,7000 154,800 Increase Cricket 189,000 148,300 Decrease\n\nParticipation among some social groups, such as black and ethnic minorities, those with disabilities and the less financially well off, is increasing.\n\nAnd if you take the slightly longer view - not necessarily all the way back to when the Games were won in 2005 but maybe to October 2011 - then there has clearly been a reasonable jump in participation connected to London 2012.\n\nBut what cannot be avoided by policy makers is this simple statistic:\n\nAlmost 18 months on from the London Olympics and the number of people playing sport once a week has increased by only 200,000.\n\nThis is a disappointingly small return for the billions of pounds of investment pumped into the staging of the Games and the funding of grassroots legacy schemes thereafter.\n\nThat failure to really move the needle in the months since the Olympics will worry ministers and sports administrators, who know the glow of that unforgettable summer is already fading.\n\nWhat will really trouble them is the continuing slump in the number of young people - aged 16-25 - playing sport. The latest figures show another decline - of 51,000, down to 3.74m - and it is clear that policy makers now need to take a much more interventionist approach to try to reverse what is looking like a long-term trend.\n\nOne of the big factors in that fall among the young has been football's alarming decline in popularity. Remarkably the national game is now only the fourth biggest participation sport behind swimming, athletics and cycling.\n\nWhat this tells you (again) is that there is no direct link between the profile and popularity of a sport at the elite level and participation at the grassroots.\n\nThis point is most neatly made by tennis which again saw a decline in the 12 months from October 2012. Having already had some of its Sport England funding withheld in April following woeful results, it now faces further cuts after another drop of 39,000.\n\nAnalysis In the year that Andy Murray won Wimbledon, there has been a fall in the number of people who play tennis at least once a week. Sport England's Active People Survey found that 406,000 people played in the year to October - a fall of 39,000 on the previous 12-month period. The LTA was tasked with increasing that number to 450,000, and Sport England will now decide in January whether they feel the LTA's long term plans for increasing participation entitle them to receive \u00a310.3m in withheld funding.\n\nAnd this in the year Andy Murray became the first British man in 77 years to win the Wimbledon singles title.\n\nBut cycling, the poster boy of British sport, has managed to turn elite success and high profile into grassroots success. Its figures are up again in the last year and it is now the third most popular sport in the country. Why do some sports seem to be able to leverage success and big name stars into bigger participation numbers, while others can't?\n\nJennie Price, chief executive of Sport England, does not have all the answers but she says, \"having a Wimbledon champion of itself is not enough. You have to have the programmes in place to capitalise on that success.\"\n\nWhile Price is far from downbeat with the overall picture, she admits she will be disappointed if she does not now see a significant increase every six months.\n\nThis is ambitious but at least there now seems to be a shift in the rhetoric from those in charge.\n\nBoth Sport England and the new Sports Minister Helen Grant are talking much tougher with the sports bodies who are being paid half of the Government's \u00a31bn participation legacy funding between now and 2017.\n\nWe should note Grant's threat on Thursday to take away funding from the sports if they don't \"step up\".\n\nFrom January all sports will be subject to a more rigorous assessment system. Sport England says if governing bodies continue to fail then they will strip them of up to 20% of their funding and start spending it on their behalf.\n\nAs we get further away from the golden summer of 2012 then delivering legacy becomes less about the inspirational moments of the Games and more about the structures and funding put in place in the months immediately after the flame was extinguished.\n\nThe next year or two will be crucial in assessing whether David Cameron's coalition got it right or whether a huge opportunity has been squandered.", "images": ["https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/mcs/media/images/71708000/jpg/_71708894_snowfooty.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/activity-guide.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=olympics::sport.olympics.correspondent_story.25356001.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:685e8b02-b288-8945-bb38-9565d0a03508]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_PS]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/64016000/jpg/_64016140_david-bond_144x81.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired-logo.svg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/71708000/jpg/_71708887_legacy.jpg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/mcs/media/images/71708000/jpg/_71708887_legacy.jpg", "date": "12/12/2013"}, "rank_38": {"title": "London 2012 regeneration has '\u00a39m funding gap'", "text": "Image caption The London Legacy Development Corporation has said it would have to increase its income or cut spending to reach its objectives\n\nA report has warned that more money is needed to achieve the legacy objectives of the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nThe London Assembly said a funding gap of around \u00a39m in 2015-16 could limit regeneration plans at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, in east London.\n\nThe London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) said it would have to increase its income or cut spending to reach its objectives.\n\nAssembly member Gareth Bacon said the legacy was \"crucial\".\n\nThe report from the London Assembly's Regeneration Committee found that reducing expenditure on security and some community events was \"not ideal\" when the park wanted to attract people to the area.\n\n'Self sustaining'\n\nThe committee has recommended the mayor of London confirms the LLDC will receive at least \u00a312m in additional funding between 2015 and 2017.\n\nAssembly member Gareth Bacon said: \"Regenerating east London and the Lower Lea Valley is important not just to meet the London 2012 legacy objectives, but for the benefit of the people of east London who will be a crucial part of building the community for years to come.\n\n\"We believe in the short term the mayor should continue to invest and support the LLDC.\n\nHowever, to ensure the LLDC's objectives are not dependant on mayoral funding indefinitely, the Corporation should commit to becoming self-sustaining as soon as possible and certainly by 2020 at the latest.\"\n\nThe report also recommended LLDC work towards its 35% affordable housing targets for the East Wick and Sweetwater residential neighbourhoods.\n\nAn agreement with Transport of London for new links between the Park and surrounding areas should be secured within 12 months, the report also said.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=london::news.england.london.story.25427019.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:9065e41a-f3fd-cb4c-b8ec-070c26c39b5f]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/71811000/jpg/_71811528_71811522.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/71811000/jpg/_71811528_71811522.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/media/images/71811000/jpg/_71811528_71811522.jpg", "date": "18/12/2013"}, "rank_114": {"title": "British volleyball's Olympic legacy: No team, no money, no future?", "text": "When you dedicate your life to a sport and make history at your home Olympics, you do not expect your national team to disappear.\n\nYet within months of London 2012, The British indoor senior teams folded, as did their English equivalents.

What has happened since to everyone who played for Team GB at their home Games?\n\nAll but a handful have moved on to other things, stepping back from a sport which stepped back from them.\n\nIn Italy, though, the flame still burns. One of the few remaining British pro volleyball players, Ciara Michel, has just completed her debut season in the sport's Champions League - the first British woman to reach that level.\n\n\"Coming to Italy was a dream of mine,\" says the 6ft 5in 28-year-old, who plays as a middle blocker for Yamamay Busto Arsizio, based just outside Milan.\n\n\"When I signed my contract, I had this overwhelming feeling of excitement.

I had goosebumps like a nervous little fan.\n\n\"Now they are my friends, and I'm getting used to the level and the attention. But I still have moments of pinching myself that I'm really here.\"\n\nLiving abroad is a fact of life for many British volleyball players, offering the chance to play in professional leagues of a much higher standard than that available in the UK.\n\nBut Michel left her home county of Somerset behind aged just 10, making a new life in the United States with her parents. She honed her volleyball at university in Miami before playing in Australia and Germany. As a result, her accent wanders through a peculiar blend of British, American and Australian pronunciation.\n\nIn her fourth-floor apartment provided by the team, Michel picks up a card sitting on a shelf. It is from Lucy Wicks, her friend and Olympic team-mate, wishing her well for her Italian adventure.\n\nThe card reads: \"Dear Ci, I am unbelievably proud of what you've already achieved and so excited about your volleyball future. Good luck in your first season in Italy - you totally belong there, among the best players in the world. Soak it all up like a sponge.\"\n\nMichel puts the card back. \"I remember reading a quote before London 2012,\" she says. \"I tried to read it every day. It said, 'Every member of Team GB has the responsibility to inspire a nation.'\n\n\"I'd really like to think I can inspire kids by being here.\"\n\nThere is not much else to inspire British children to take up volleyball. Officials pleaded with funding body UK Sport in January but only limited funding for a women's beach volleyball team was released - the women's indoor squad has had no cash since 2010.\n\n\"I don't think we as players and staff could have done any more,\" wrote Michel's GB team-mate, Maria Bertelli, external-link when the team disbanded after finishing ninth out of 12 teams at the Olympics.\n\n\"We delivered our best performances on the court when it mattered. To be in the situation now whereby there will be no competing GB teams, as dramatic as this may sound, with 100% honesty, is soul-destroying.\"\n\nMichel knows her own power to inspire is tempered by the dismantling of these national teams.\n\n\"There are still people working behind the scenes to try to make something happen,\" she insists.\n\n\"I would only have a few more years, maybe, to play. But it's even sadder to think that the kids have nothing to look up to.\n\n\"Maybe there are young girls in England that could have looked up to something to go forward with. Now, there's nothing to speak of.\"\n\nWhile Michel blazes a lonely trail at the heights of European volleyball, all hope is not quite extinguished back home in the UK.\n\nAn English men's under-20 team made it through to the second round of their European Championships for the first time external-link earlier this month, and a junior team based in London is now raising funds external-link to represent England at the World Schools Championships in April.\n\nThe boys of Chadwell Heath, hoping to represent England at the World Schools Championships\n\n\"It is very sad to think that we may not have a senior team to progress into,\" says David Amah, captain of that junior team. The teenagers have raised more than \u00a32,000 but need almost \u00a310,000 to go to the tournament.\n\n\"We need to fight to re-establish England and GB senior teams so this tragedy is not a prolonged reality,\" he added. \"We need to have an Olympic legacy. Surely a big part of the legacy is that the youth have high heights to aim for.\"\n\nYamamay Busto routinely pack out their own dedicated stadium, decked in the team's bright pink. When the crowd roars, Michel is reminded of the atmosphere at London 2012, when Britain beat Algeria for their first-ever - perhaps their last - Olympic victory.\n\n\"We were such underdogs, completely out of our depth in volleyball, but going out there and gunning for it,\" she remembers.\n\n\"We walked out of the tunnel and you could just see a sea, an ocean of British flags and red and blue and white, and people screaming.\n\n\"It was unreal to win. That was a historic moment, something that has never been done before.\n\n\"The way the funding has gone, perhaps it never will again.\"", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/mcs/media/images/72138000/jpg/_72138481_72138480.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/240/cpsprodpb/14BDA/production/_111345948_gettyimages-960476772.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=volleyball::sport.volleyball.story.25646427.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:6ff3521e-2ba0-7c42-a333-2880d79d1f39]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_GNL]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/mcs/media/images/72138000/jpg/_72138728_c6e66d50-093c-40df-a565-53c10ad44e0d.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/240/cpsprodpb/3C68/production/_111346451_gettyimages-955258330.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/240/cpsprodpb/9F4F/production/_111338704_kjtgetty.jpg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/624/mcs/media/images/72138000/jpg/_72138481_72138480.jpg", "date": "08/01/2014"}, "rank_25": {"title": "Olympic Park affordable housing 'trade off'", "text": "Image copyright W Communications Image caption Residents have already moved into new homes in the former athletes village used during the 2012 Games\n\nLess \"affordable housing\" is to be built on the 2012 Olympic Games site in a \"trade off\" for more economic activity, London's mayor has said.\n\nFewer homes will be built overall, and a smaller than promised percentage of those would be affordable, Boris Johnson said.\n\nOne reason for the shift is due to the plan for a new cultural centre at the site in Stratford, east London.\n\nIf the hub is built there would be a loss of around 1,000 new homes.\n\nBut Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green Party London Assembly members accused him of endangering the Olympic housing legacy.\n\n'Olympicopolis hub'\n\nA total of 7,000 homes had originally been planned for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nSpeaking at a London Assembly meeting, Mr Johnson said fewer homes in the park was a \"price well worth paying\" if other forms of regeneration led to more jobs and economic activity.\n\n\"To an extent, this is a trade off,\" he said.\n\nHe believes the cultural \"hub\" - known as Olympicopolis - would lead to more homes being built in east London in the long-run.\n\nThe cultural centre is backed by University College London and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nIt's also emerged that the next housing development to be constructed in the park will fall short of the mayor's affordable housing target.\n\n'Windy aspirations'\n\nThe original promise was for 40% of 1,500 homes in the neighbourhoods to be known as East Wick and Sweetwater to be be affordable.\n\nThe dream of affordable housing is fading.

no matter who they are and what their ability - the chance to take part.\n\n\"However, public funding is a privilege not a right and has to go to the organisations that can make a real difference.\"\n\nThe BBC understands sports charities such as Sported, StreetGames, Parkrun, Access Sport, Street League and Greenhouse could now receive more of the \u00a31bn that Sport England spends every five years to fund community sport and encourage participation.\n\nIn a sign that the government is running out of patience with some NGBs, a more 'mixed economy' approach will be considered, with other providers trusted to deliver results.\n\nAround 10,000 participants were involved in June's Great North Swim at Lake Windermere\n\nLast month, Crouch criticised the UK's \"severely outdated\" sports strategy after an alarming decline in the numbers of people taking part in swimming, the country's most popular sport in terms of participation, with 144,200 fewer people visiting their local pool in the last six months.\n\nShe pledged to \"rip up that strategy and start again\", and a nine-week consultation will begin on Tuesday in what could be a major shake-up of sports policy.\n\nHowever, Clive Efford MP, Labour's Shadow Sports Minister, said: \"The government's consultation is five years too late and can't hide the fact that with a year to Rio, the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic legacy is crumbling because the government's sports strategy under David Cameron has been an abject failure; he's wasted a once in a generation opportunity to inspire people to get active and play sport.\"\n\nAccording to Sport England, the percentage of those on the lowest incomes participating in sport has hit the lowest level since records began in 2005/06.\n\nAnd at a time of rising childhood obesity, less school sport and cuts to local authority leisure budgets, official figures show that most five to 10-year-olds (59.6%) and 11 to 15-year-olds (42.5%) say the 2012 Games had \"not at all\" encouraged them to take part in sport.\n\nThe previous coalition government was criticised for abolishing \u00a3162m of ring-fenced funding for national School Sport Partnerships, although \u00a3150m a year was subsequently reinstated in the form of a school sport premium.\n\nMany blame what they see as the lack of a coherent, joined up, cross-departmental national sports policy, and Emma Boggis, CEO of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: \"A new strategy has to aim to integrate physical activity policy everywhere - from schools to local authorities, from transport to health services.\n\n\"Anything less will be a lost opportunity. It's been 13 years since the last sports strategy. A lot has changed since then and we need to work together to make sure that the UK is fit for the future. It needs to be a root and branch review of the government's objectives.\"\n\nThe government has become increasingly ruthless with NGBs, cutting their public funding if they fail to deliver participation targets.\n\nIn 2014, Sport England reduced its investment into England Basketball and began funding community organisations with strong track records such as the British Basketball League Foundation and Reach & Teach.\n\nNational sports charity StreetGames was given \u00a36m for its Doorstep Sport Clubs programme, a reward for it reaching its target of setting up 307 clubs and getting more young people from disadvantaged communities into sport.\n\nWho's taking part in what Oct 2012-Oct 2013 Oct 2013-Oct 2014 Change Source: Sport England's Active People Survey Swimming 2.93m 2.69m Decrease Athletics 2.02m 2.16m Increase Cycling 2.00m 2.07m Increase Football 1.84m 1.90m Increase Golf 751,900 730,300 Decrease Badminton 500,500 490,200 Decrease Tennis 406,000 384,200 Decrease Equestrian 312,700 304,400 Decrease Bowls 264,300 243,400 Decrease Squash/racketball 240,700 196,500 Decrease Rugby union 159,900 178,800 Increase Cricket 148,300 167,200 Increase Netball 122,200 148,700 Increase Boxing 154,800 145,100 Decrease Basketball 154,700 131,100 Decrease\n\nChair of the Sports Think Tank, Andy Reed, said: \"There is a strong appetite for change. It's time to embrace new technology, new players and new approaches if we are going to maximise the potential of sport to improve sports participation and the nation's health, fitness and well-being.\n\n\"It is time the sector came together to create and deliver a truly inspirational long-term, cross departmental sport and physical activity strategy.\"\n\nSome NGBs will no doubt feel Crouch is over-reacting. After all, there are doubts over the reliability of the data that Sport England bases its annual Active People Survey on and the extent to which it determines funding decisions. In addition, some sports - cycling and athletics for example - are increasing in popularity.\n\nFacilities, changing lifestyles, school sport and the drift of sports towards satellite television and less exposure all play a role.\n\nSome suspect this consultation will pave the way for an impending cut to sports funding in the autumn spending review, and question the government's commitment when sport is still not represented by a Secretary of State.\n\nAlthough 1.4m more people are participating now than when the bid to host the Games was won in 2005, the struggle to make the nation more active since 2012 is in stark contrast to the success Britain has enjoyed in elite sport.\n\nAlthough controversial for discriminating against less established sports, the 'no compromise' approach of UK Sport has delivered impressive results with a record medal haul at the London Games. Crouch will now want more of the same, but with cuts to the current record levels of elite sport funding expected in the future, that could also prove a challenge.\n\nFor now however, the priority appears to be participation rather than high-level performance.\n\nThe 2012 Olympics were won on a promise of a glorious sporting legacy, but exactly three years on, the consultation represents an admission that the country is failing to capitalise on that memorable summer of sport, and the \u00a39.3bn it cost to stage.", "images": ["https://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/66074000/jpg/_66074732_dan-roan_144x81.jpg", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/activity-guide.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=other::sport.correspondent_story.33767555.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:a8a54a49-e9a1-6144-918c-11021c2399f5]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_PS]&x12=[SPORT]", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired-logo.svg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/1207F/production/_84655837_london_marathon_getty.jpg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/1207F/production/_84655837_london_marathon_getty.jpg", "date": "04/08/2015"}, "rank_149": {"title": "West Ham: Taxpayers to meet Olympic Stadium running costs", "text": "West Ham United will become 'anchor tenants' of the Olympic Stadium from next year\n\nWest Ham United will have many of the running costs met by the taxpayer when they move to the \u00a3700m Olympic Stadium next year, the BBC has learnt.\n\nCritics say it means the Premier League club will get their new home virtually rent free.\n\nWest Ham won the bid to occupy the stadium, which was built for the London 2012 Olympics, and are expected to move from their Upton Park ground in August 2016.\n\nThe public authority that owns the stadium, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), has revealed some details of its rental agreement with the club in response to a Freedom of Information request.\n\nMuch of the contract between LLDC and West Ham, which has been seen by the BBC, is redacted.\n\nBut it does show that a large number of \"facilities and services\" will be paid for by the grantor - ie the taxpayer - and not the club.\n\nThese include the cost of stadium utilities, security, maintaining the pitch, and even the goalposts and corner flags.\n\nThe BBC understands other overheads that could also be paid by the LLDC include the cost of stewarding and policing on match days, which amounts to many hundreds of thousands of pounds for other Premier League clubs.\n\nTwo separate football business experts told the BBC the value of the services amounts to between \u00a31.4m and \u00a32.5m a year.\n\nWest Ham, who received more than \u00a376m in prize money for finishing 12th in the Premier League last season, are understood to be paying approximately \u00a32m to \u00a32.5m a year in rent.\n\nManchester City pay all their overheads on top of \u00a34m rent a year at their former Commonwealth Games venue\n\nChris Bryant, Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, called on the government to publish all the details of the deal or he will join calls for a full public inquiry.\n\n\"To all intents and purposes, this is a contract which gives West Ham the stadium at a peppercorn rent at most or, to be honest, for no rent whatsoever,\" Bryant told the BBC.\n\n\"The question is, if we were able to see the fuller facts and figures, which I think we should, would we be even more angry?\"\n\nWest Ham said: \"Without us the stadium would lose money. The suggestion we are getting the stadium rent free is categorically wrong - we are more than paying our way.\n\n\"Our agreement with the LLDC will see West Ham make a substantial capital contribution towards the conversion works of a stadium on top of a multi-million pound annual usage fee, a share of food and catering sales, plus provide extra value to the naming rights agreement.\n\n\"Our presence underwrites the multi-use legacy of the stadium and our contribution alone will pay back more than the cost of building and converting the stadium over the course of our tenancy.\"\n\nThe LLDC has not disclosed all the details of its agreement with West Ham.\n\nIt says it is restricted by financial confidentiality because of commercially sensitive figures, much to the frustration of those who feel the full terms should be revealed in the public interest.\n\nBryant said: \"We're talking about such enormous sums of money that I think most British taxpayers would want to know what the deal was that was signed on their behalf, and that's the first hurdle that the government has got to cross.\n\n\"If it doesn't come through then I think the demands for a full public inquiry will grow and that's the point at which I'll start to want to join in those.\"\n\nWest Ham statement \"Without us the stadium would lose money. The suggestion we are getting the stadium rent free is wrong - we are more than paying our way. \"There is absolutely no chance tickets will be dumped on the market. We need to move as we have simply outgrown the Boleyn Ground. \"It defies logic that David Gold and David Sullivan will sell the club. They have made it clear they would like to pass their shares on to their children. \"They were also happy to include a clause that would return a substantial sum of money to the taxpayer should they sell the club following our move to Stratford.\"\n\nWhen the final bill for the reconstruction of the stadium was revealed in June, West Ham's contribution of \u00a315m towards the \u00a3272m conversion costs already looked like a bargain for the club - especially at a time when Premier League clubs are about to benefit from a record \u00a35.1bn TV rights contract.\n\nBut they now appear to be getting an even better deal, raising serious questions over the way the stadium was used after London 2012, and whether there should be more transparency over the arrangement.\n\nBarry Hearn, chairman of Leyton Orient when they dropped a three-year long legal challenge in 2014 against West Ham's move to the Olympic Stadium, said: \"This is about the Olympic Stadium which has now been effectively transferred to a commercial enterprise for virtually nothing. Something doesn't smell right.\n\n\"It doesn't take a genius to work out, in today's world of Premiership football, that [the running costs] actually come to more than \u00a32.5m a year.\"\n\nThat West Ham will not be paying those costs themselves is in contrast to the situation at Manchester City, who pay all their overheads - on top of rent of about \u00a34m a year agreed with Manchester City Council - for the Etihad Stadium, which was also initially funded by taxpayers for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\n\nIt has been reported that Chelsea and Tottenham may have to pay between \u00a311m and \u00a315m a year to play at Wembley if they temporarily use the national stadium while they redevelop their grounds.\n\nThe City of Manchester Stadium was always designed with football in mind as the sole post-Commonwealth Games use for the venue. That meant it cost \u00a342m to convert, compared to the \u00a3272m bill that the Olympic Stadium's conversion has required - \u00a335m over budget.\n\n\"They built the wrong stadium,\" Hearn said.\n\nAsked why a multi-use stadium was not designed and built in the beginning, LLDC chief executive David Goldstone said: \"I think that wasn't possible at the time.\n\n\"There wasn't an offer of a football tenant and, without football, it wouldn't have worked.\n\nDavid Gold (left) and David Sullivan have owned West Ham since 2010\n\n\"It would have been a real leap to make that sort of decision, so I'm very happy those decisions that were made were the right ones.\n\n\"We can look forward now and say how can we best secure the long-term future so that it can be multi-use, it can pay its own way, and I think that's what we've done with this stadium.\"\n\nThe stadium was designed to be converted into a 25,000-seat athletics facility after the Olympics. However, it later became apparent that having a Premier League football club would be far more financially viable, with Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham left to fight it out as the two main bidders.\n\nSpurs wanted to remove the running track, but that was seen as politically unacceptable when London's 2012 bid team had promised the International Olympic Committee that an athletics legacy would be maintained at the stadium.\n\nWest Ham were, therefore, seen as the only option, leaving them in a very strong bargaining position. The stadium then had to be converted for both football and athletics.\n\nBryant said: \"It looks to me as if, because there was only ever one player that anybody was really interested in, that Boris Johnson (former chair of the LLDC) bent over backwards to accommodate them and West Ham ended up with a deal which is astoundingly good for them.\"\n\nExactly how good this \"astounding\" deal is remains unclear while so many pages of the published contract have been blacked out.\n\nOne of the key unknowns is how much money the taxpayer would receive as a 'claw-back' if West Ham were sold, at a profit, in the future.\n\nEuropean Commission investigations relating to 'State Aid' The European Commission is currently investigating four complaints of alleged 'State Aid' contributions involving 12 professional football clubs in the Netherlands and Spain. Seven Spanish clubs are involved: Barcelona, Real Madrid, Valencia, Athletic Bilbao, Hercules, Elche and Osasuna Five Dutch clubs are involved: PSV Eindhoven, Willem II, NEC, FC Den Bosch and MVV The complaints range from possible tax privileges, loans given by the state-owned banks to a club, and the use of public resources to benefit certain teams\n\nWhile owners David Gold and David Sullivan insist West Ham is not for sale, they have expressed a desire to sell some shares and valued the club at \u00a3400m in December, four times its value when they arrived in 2010.\n\n\"It's highly likely that it will be sold to foreign investors,\" says Prof Simon Chadwick from Coventry University Business School. \"If it's still in English ownership by 2020, I'll be very surprised.\"\n\nWest Ham's deal with the LLDC could come under scrutiny should a relevant party make a complaint to the European Commission, under EU competition law relating to 'state aid' contributions.\n\n\"State aid rules in Europe are there for a good reason, which is that no government should be giving financial advantage of whatever kind to one commercial player over another commercial player,\" Bryant explained.\n\n\"These are very real issues that are already affecting other football clubs in Europe.\n\n\"If it were subsequently proven that there had been illegal state aid provided to West Ham through this deal, then West Ham would end up having to pay back any potential financial advantage that might have accrued to them, which could run to the best part of half a billion.\"\n\nHowever, Goldstone said: \"I'm not losing sleep about whether somebody else is going to make a challenge into something that's already been looked at and considered and isn't being enquired into by the appropriate body any further.\n\nBoris Johnson is accused of 'bending over backwards' to accommodate West Ham's move to the Olympic Stadium\n\n\"West Ham, I believe, have got a good deal, but we have got a really good solution to make sure that we bring billions of pounds of economic benefit into the area.\n\n\"We have an arrangement with West Ham where they pay a fee for using the stadium, effectively serviced, and that's the basic structure of the agreement.\"\n\nThe LLDC also points to the security gained by having an anchor tenant on a 99-year lease, and insists this will avoid the kind of 'white elephants' that blight Olympic parks in former host cities such as Barcelona, Athens and Beijing.\n\nThe stadium will only be given over to athletics for one month each year, but it will also host 10 annual community sports events, a new floodlit community running track and a training and education centre.\n\nBoris Johnson declined a request to be interviewed by the BBC. However, a spokesperson for the London Major said: \"The Olympic Stadium remains in public ownership and will be capable of hosting a variety of other events and sports.\n\n\"The mayor has secured long-term sustainable investment in order to protect an iconic stadium that Londoners took to their hearts, and which is now set to be home to almost every conceivable sport, concert or community event for decades to come.\n\n\"That has resulted in the creation of a venue that will drive and sustain thousands of jobs, contribute to over \u00a33bn of wider economic benefit, where a share of the profits will be paid back into the taxpayers coffers and which provides a genuine Olympic legacy for London.\"\n\nThe Olympic Stadium: How the Hammers Struck Gold will be shown on BBC One London at 19:00 BST on Thursday, 6 August and available nationally on the BBC iPlayer shortly afterwards.", "images": ["https://c.files.bbci.co.uk/529C/production/_90984112_roanthm.jpg", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=football::premier_league::west_ham::sport.football.premier_league.west_ham.correspondent_story.33780720.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:9c1a9acf-1699-df45-9df3-238ea08f6d11]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-correspondent]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[SPORT_PS]&x12=[SPORT]", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/F6A3/production/_84693136_gettyimages-481881998.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/D7BC/production/_84682255_gettyimages-481881998.jpg", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/activity-guide.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.bbc.co.uk/onesport/2.11.755/images/get-inspired/get-inspired-logo.svg"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/D7BC/production/_84682255_gettyimages-481881998.jpg", "date": "06/08/2015"}, "rank_79": {"title": "Andrew Baggaley: Table tennis player questions Olympic legacy", "text": "Last updated on .From the section Table tennis\n\nAndrew Baggaley has won six Commonwealth Games medals\n\nLondon 2012 Olympic table tennis player Andrew Baggaley says it is \"strange\" that minority sports have not capitalised on the Games.\n\nThe Milton Keynes-based 32-year-old was a 2012 bid ambassador and Games participant, but questioned its legacy.\n\n\"The country was so united in 2012 and everyone was going sport crazy, but it seems strange that no one's really capitalised on it,\" he told BBC Sport.\n\n\"Not only table tennis, but I'd like to see the other sports you don't see.\"\n\nFigures released by Sport England show that while football, cycling, cricket and athletics have seen increased participation, badminton, bowls and basketball have experienced declining numbers.\n\nBaggaley is England's most successful male table tennis player of all time at the Commonwealth Games, and believes the legacy of London 2012 has resulted in mixed fortunes for his sport.\n\n\"I think recreationally the 2012 legacy has been successful,\" he said. \"My brother is a table tennis coach and he has masses of people coming to his sessions now.\n\n\"It's been incredible, but at the top level table tennis isn't seen.

any more people doing sport?", "text": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mo Farah wins gold in Men's 5000m, London 2012\n\nFive years ago this month, the London Olympic Games - seen as a great success for Britain - came to a close.\n\nAt the time, the country was promised that the end of the Games would not mean the end of the success story, that there would be a lasting legacy for sport participation.\n\nBut, in England at least, that promise was broken.\n\nThe government gave Sport England \u00a31bn to invest in grassroots sports, and Jeremy Hunt, then Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, said the Games provided an \"extraordinary chance\" to \"reinvigorate this country's sporting habits for both the young and the old\".\n\nHe described it as a \"once-in-a-generation opportunity, a real golden moment for the UK\".\n\nBut there has been virtually no increase in participation in sport.\n\nSince 2005, when London won the bid to host the Olympics, Sport England has surveyed people about their physical activity.\n\nIn 2005-06 the proportion of over-16s in England who played sport for at least 30 minutes each week was 34.6%. By 2015-16, it was 36.1%.\n\nAmong 16- to 25-year-olds, there has been no change at all in participation rates since 2005-06.\n\nWhat about younger children?\n\nFrom 2012, Sport England has included 14- and 15-year-olds in the survey.\n\nSchool sport is included, so a higher percentage of this age group report playing sport once a week - about 70%.\n\nAnd while it looks like there may have been a post-Olympic boost, the proportion then dropped back to just under 70%.\n\nTo look at participation rates for children younger than 14, we can look at Taking Part, an England-wide survey from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.\n\nSince 2011-12, this survey has asked a number of questions about the impact of the London Games, including whether hosting the Olympics encouraged respondents to take part in sport.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn 2015-16, nearly 70% of the five- to 10-year-olds answered: \"Not at all.\"\n\nOf the 11- to 15-year-olds, 57% said the Games had encouraged them to take part in sport.\n\nBut the Taking Part survey has a similar measure to Sport England of playing sport for 30 minutes a week.\n\nAnd, although it shows higher participation rates in younger children, overall, for both age groups, there has been no change.\n\nBut the sports legacy was part of a wider set of ambitions that included:\n\neconomic regeneration\n\nimproving transport links\n\nproviding world class sporting facilities in London and across the UK\n\nthe creation of a new green space, the Olympic Park\n\nAnd the London Games legacy is evident when it comes to elite sport and medals.\n\nAlthough British Athletics came sixth in the medal table at the World Championships last week, they hit their target.\n\nAnd in Olympic and Paralympic sports as a whole, Team GB retain their strong position.\n\nIn the 2012 London Games, Team GB athletes came third in the overall medal tables for both the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nAnd in Rio, four years later, they came second in both - the first nation in the history of the Olympics to improve their medal tally following a home games.\n\nRead more from Reality Check\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "images": ["https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=news.england.story.40817063.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:25d7713a-c199-ad44-b371-cc6cd871407d]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.3.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_PS]&x12=[NEWS_ENGLISH_REGIONS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/121D7/production/_97199147_mofarahwinsgoldinmen's5000mreutershi015689541.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/121D7/production/_97199147_mofarahwinsgoldinmen's5000mreutershi015689541.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/121D7/production/_97199147_mofarahwinsgoldinmen's5000mreutershi015689541.jpg", "date": "17/08/2017"}, "rank_30": {"title": "London Olympic Stadium taken over by mayor Sadiq Khan", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An independent review says the cost of converting the Olympic Stadium was \u00a3323million\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan has agreed to take over the former Olympic Stadium amid \"financial challenges\".\n\nMr Khan says a \"catalogue of errors\" by his predecessor Boris Johnson led to the costs of transforming it into West Ham United's new ground soaring.\n\nAn independent review says the conversion cost \u00a3323m -

all seven venues on the park are in private hands, with millions of visitors a year, and a positive economic legacy for east London.\n\n\"The stadium has a secure future with athletics and football.\n\n\"The mistakes belonged to Khan's Labour predecessor Ken Livingstone and the Blair government.
