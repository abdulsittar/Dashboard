The Olympic Delivery Authority has held discussions with both clubs but is maintaining its original plan to build the Olympic and Paralympic Games' central venue with 80,000 mostly temporary seats and then scale it down to a 25,000-capacity stadium still containing an athletics track.\n\nThe ODA and Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, are responsible for securing a sustainable \"legacy\" for the massive public money - upwards of \u00a32bn - which will be spent on hosting the Olympics, and there is no appetite for millions of it to subsidise a Premier League football club which wants a bigger home on the cheap. The London organisers are determined not to repeat what was done in Manchester where \u00a3120m of public money was spent building a permanent stadium for the 2002 Commonwealth Games - and then the track was removed so the stadium could be handed to Manchester City on terms regarded as startlingly generous.\n\nThat deal - under which City pay no rent up to an attendance of 32,500 then share revenue above that gate with the local council - is thought to have encouraged the London clubs to hope a similar gift horse was riding into Greenwich. However the ODA has made it clear that if the stadium is to host football after the Games with, say, a 60,000 permanent capacity - at an extra cost which some informed sources put at about \u00a3200m - this will not come out of public money. The clubs would have to pay for it themselves and that has sent them away disappointed.\n\n\"The option is still outstanding,\" David Higgins, the ODA chief executive said, \"but we are moving ahead to procure the stadium with a 25,000-seat legacy.\"\n\nWest Ham, the subject of takeover speculation and carrying \u00a340m of debts, are not considered a realistic prospect to take on the stadium, and Tottenham are a long way from having the required amount of money - although both want to expand their grounds.\n\nThe London Development Agency, which is contributing \u00a3260m to the Olympics and is responsible for securing a broader economic and social legacy, is understood to be wary of a football club moving into the new stadium as it would require a current ground to be demolished. Manchester City's Maine Road ground in the deprived area of Moss Side has been knocked down; housing is planned for the site.\n\nThe determination not to spend extra money creating an unnecessarily lavish stadium which ultimately boosts the life-chances of a privately owned Premier League club is part of the wider commitment to secure a sustainable legacy.\n\nOf the new venues due to be built, only the 10,000-seat handball arena will remain as a permanent facility after the Games. The aquatic centre, the first to go out to tender, will remain for the local community in the Lea Valley but its seating will be reduced from 20,000 to a more realistic capacity of 3,500; the velodrome, hockey stadium and paralympic tennis centre will either be reduced in size or reconfigured after the Games; three venues are to be dismantled and relocated elsewhere in the country, while two more, the 8,000-capacity fencing arena and 5,000-seat water polo pool, will be temporary structures.\n\n\"We are building facilities to match future use and a viable business case,\" Higgins said. \"Some major events leave a fabulous stadium but with huge ongoing operating costs. We've said all along: no white elephants.\"\n\nThe cost, however, is still enormous. The total funding for the Olympics made available from the national lottery, London council tax payers and the LDA is \u00a32.375bn - but the final building costs are likely to require substantial additional taxpayers' money, following discussions Higgins has held recently with the Treasury. In addition, the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Locog) needs to raise \u00a32bn from the private sector to pay for the running of the Games.\n\nConstruction of the venues has not yet gone out to tender so there are no detailed designs but I understand that a working estimate for building the main Olympic stadium, even with temporary seating and reduction post-Games to 25,000 seats, is put at about \u00a3350m. The ODA will look to appoint a contractor to design and build a stadium of the quality needed for such a prestigious event, and also an adviser to plan the 25,000-seat version's long-term viability afterwards - which should include use by the community and possibly a new school, as well as sporting events.\n\nWith 40,000 homes due to be built and 60,000 jobs promised, including for the sizeable deprived population in the Lea Valley, the Olympics forms part of wider east London regeneration plans for which Mayor Livingstone is responsible. There have been worries within his office recently that in the drive towards hosting a successful Olympics in 2012, these more solid social benefits could be lost.\n\n\"There was some concern,\" according to Neale Coleman, the mayor's Olympics adviser, \"that the regeneration, social and economic legacies could fall between the ODA and Locog, and dribble away. We have made a concerted effort to ensure that does not happen. We have produced a series of documents so that all the authorities, including the government, are signed up in concrete terms to what needs to be done. The same is happening nationally and the process is almost complete.\"\n\nOne example on which the LDA is particularly keen is for local people to be given training, skills and employment on constructing the venues, and for this to be included as a formal commitment by whichever contractors are taken on.\n\nThere is one central part of the Olympic promise which still risks being neglected: the pledge by the prime minister, Tony Blair, that the Olympics will inspire a new generation of young people to play more sport. The risk is the opposite - that money will be diverted from investment in community facilities as \u00a3750m of lottery money is earmarked for the Olympics, including about \u00a3290m from Sport England so far, with another hefty amount due to be pledged.\n\nOfficial plans are being produced to develop sport nationally - backed by major public money - but Sport England is concerned whether the government will provide enough cash to match its rhetoric, and truly boost participation.\n\nWho pays for 2012?\n\nTotal estimated cost of Games \u00a34.375bn\n\n\u00a32bn from private sector\n\n\u00a3750m From National Lottery (new games)\n\n\u00a3750m National Lottery (general funds)\n\n\u00a3625m London council-tax payers\n\n\u00a3250m London Development Agency\n\ndavid.conn@theguardian.com", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Sport%2CPolitics%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "11/10/2006"}, "rank_84": {"title": "Jonathan Glancey: Ill-defined plans could leave a disastrous legacy for 2012 Olympics", "text": "No one really knows how much the London Olympics will cost - not Sir Roy McNulty, head of the grimly named Olympic Delivery Authority, nor Tessa Jowell, secretary of state for culture, media and sport, nor even the mayor of London. Common sense tells us to assume several billion more than the current figure. Onwards and domewards.\n\nTo a national chorus of low-level grumbling, this lumbering, bullying, ill-tempered and overpoliticised roadshow will gasp towards completion, with a final hugely expensive sprint, run by relays of cheap imported labour. The games themselves will be short-lived, of course, but an event many, if not all, of us will whoop at in front of giant TV screens in smokeless pubs or, with take-aways on our laps, in the privacy of homes taxed to the rafters for the big event.\n\nSir Roy says the original Olympics budget was put together without a full analysis of the site or fully costed designs for new venues. For today's top business folk operating in the cloud-cuckoo world of PPP and PFI finances, this sort of oversight is purely a matter of course. Give the man a bonus. But there is a fundamental, and costly, problem with the way Britain has been bludgeoning its way towards 2012. This is the conflation of the Olympics and urban \"regeneration\". While the first may be costed with some degree of accuracy, the price of the latter may as well be infinite.\n\nWhile the games themselves will occupy a specific site, the associated \"regeneration\" area has no ultimate boundaries and thus no final cost. \"Regeneration\" is a word, and creed, bandied about by politicians inspired, like prophets, by what they like to call \"vision\". The vision they share with fast-breeding quangos and saintly property developers is one of \"vibrant\" and \"sustainable\" communities stretching out towards the chalcedony-lined streets of some future New Jerusalem. But where and how far will this brave and costly Olympian world of Shanghai-style offices blocks and US-style shopping malls reach? Dagenham? Up the M11 to Cambridge? No one knows.\n\nWhat we do know is that the stretch of the river Lea winding through the Olympic Park has been at the heart of the 2012 regeneration \"vision\". According to the mayor of London's Lower Lea Valley Opportunity Area Planning Framework document, \"the overall vision is to transform the lower Lea valley to become a vibrant, high-quality and sustainable mixed-use city district that is fully integrated into the urban fabric of London and is set within an unrivalled landscape that contains new high-quality parkland and water features\".\n\nThis is regeneration yak on an Olympian scale. This particular report does not spell out, beyond \"water features\" and acres of office space, shops for rent and \"affordable\" homes, what specific industries and jobs might be coming this way from 2012. And yet, to capitalise on a presumed Olympic legacy, and to keep costs finite and justifiable, all those working on the Olympic \"vision\" need to tell us just what is planned for these promised lands.\n\nIt would be far better to invest in one shining regeneration project, even if modest, than to attempt to cure all London's ills by chucking money about like some wildly generous drunk. Imagine, for example, if the Olympic team were able to build just one happily confined new London district. Handsome, compact, flood-proof homes, sheltered from the bitter winds scything through the Lea valley, connected to arcades of shops and useful services, served by public transport and within walking distance of schools and worthwhile jobs.\n\nThe Olympic Park stands on the old Great Eastern Railway locomotive works; the banks of the Lea were once lined with what was, in its day, hi-tech industry. The spirit of this place should encourage the construction not of millions of square feet of offices and chain stores - nor simplistic talk of \"parkland and water features\", nor even of how many millions of pounds the games might generate for the economy - but of well-serviced accommodation for future industry.\n\nImagine London designing and building its own low-energy bus fleet here. Imagine the latest biotech and nano-tech laboratories on the banks of the Lea. Imagine real jobs for local people. Such innovation might well encourage the best and most exciting new European industry, and be worth at least some of the political aggression driving the nastiest Olympics yet held.\n\n\u00b7 Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic\n\n\n\njonathan.glancey@theguardian.com", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=London+politics%2CSociety%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CCommunities%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CSport%2CLondon%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "13/12/2006"}, "rank_230": {"title": "Debate: Will the legacy of 2012 be worth all the extra cost?", "text": "Yes: David Higgins - Olympic Delivery Authority chief executive\n\nOne thing we haven't been short of since London was awarded the 2012 Games is talk about costs - a raft of different and speculative figures have been mentioned in the last few weeks alone. What has been missing from the cost debate is any real focus on value and what we call the other side of the balance sheet - the regeneration opportunity that hosting the Games provides. London 2012 can be remembered as the Games for the next generation.\n\nOne of the questions currently being addressed is how best to harness the power of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to change one of the poorest parts of the country for good. A quick look at the Olympic Park size makes it clear why leaving a lasting legacy is at the heart of the vision for 2012. The Lower Lea Valley is scarred by derelict land. Decades of under-investment have left the area a virtual industrial wasteland, home to some of the most deprived communities in the country.\n\nOur regeneration ambition is to build a new town the size of Exeter in the Lower Lea Valley, all on recycled brown-field land that in legacy will provide thousands of new homes; new transport links and infrastructure; alongside world-class sports facilities in one of the largest new urban parks in Europe for 150 years. This transformation will be matched by opportunities for significant social and economic change.\n\nAnd while this investment is about far more than just a month of sport, let us not also underestimate the priceless value that hosting the world's biggest sporting event will bring. This is a once in-a-lifetime opportunity value that hosting the world's biggest sporting event will bring. The transformative power of the Olympic Games will help inspire a new generation of young people to participate in sport up and down the country.\n\nPlans to develop the Lower Lea Valley have been around for many years - the pot marked regeneration is money that would always eventually have had to be spent on this neglected part of East London. But none of this would be possible in such a short time frame were it not for London winning the Games. The Games are the catalyst for accelerating change and we are locking in legacy right at the start of the planning process.\n\nThe Games can be viewed not so much as a cost but as an investment. Let us not forget why so many cities compete for the privilege for the Games - they recognise the benefits and the opportunities they will bring. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and we will have failed if we look back post 2012 and regret that we didn't have the vision to make the most of the prize.\n\nIt is right when we are talking about taxpayers' money that there is real scrutiny about costs. The debate will continue for a while longer yet. But one thing I am certain of - the legacy will last infinitely longer and will continue to shine long after the Olympic and Paralympic flames leave London in 2012.\n\nNo: Tim Lamb - Central Council for Physical Recreation chief executive\n\nIn all the hot air which has risen from the debate about London's Olympics and Paralympics in recent weeks, there is one word which has been conspicuously absent - sport. But this should not come as a surprise. Ministers know that nothing heats the air of an Olympic story more than a rising budget - and some reports now estimate that the budget has doubled since the bid.\n\nHosting a Games was always going to be a hugely expensive undertaking. But can taxpayers be assured that the Games and the legacy they leave will represent good value for money?\n\nGoverning bodies of sport and recreation would argue that while they want these Olympics they should not come at any price. Make no mistake, there can be no group more excited about the possibilities the Games bring. The defining feature of the London bid, that \"grassroots participation would be boosted and an already sports-mad nation would get fitter and healthier\" told them all they wanted to hear. The government was committed to creating a legacy of participation from the Games which would last a lifetime.\n\nToday, however, that legacy recedes with each budget increase. For every extra pound spent on security or project management a pound must be found from somewhere else. Depending on where those extra pounds are raised, a rising budget could be catastrophic for the participation legacy, pushing the Games past the price of acceptability. Ministers would be well advised to do two things to keep that price within bounds which would retain the support of sport and the wider public. The first is to rule out raiding the lottery. Olympic lottery games are already drawing funds away from other distributors as part of the original funding plan. Sport England is also contributing \u00a3290m, the equivalent of hundreds of new community clubhouses and all-weather pitches. But as the budget balloons, top-slicing the funds raised by the generic lottery games becomes more attractive to ministers.\n\nThe effect of this would be to decimate funding for grassroots sport (and countless other good causes) through the lottery. This would not only damage the ability of community clubs to step up and meet the Olympic legacy challenge, it could threaten sports' ability just to stand still.\n\nThe second is for ministers to take a step back and think about what they set out to achieve. As 2012 approaches, there will be a tendency to concentrate on the smooth-running of the event itself. But ministers must also try to remember the wider objectives they had in mind when they decided toback a bid; not least promoting sport and activity. If the Games' potential is to be truly fulfilled, then ministers must look again at what the price, and cost in terms of opportunity, of an unfettered Olympic bill could be.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Sport%2CPolitics%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "07/03/2007"}, "rank_260": {"title": "George Monbiot: London is getting into the Olympic spirit - by kicking out the Gypsies", "text": "Everything we have been told about the Olympic legacy turns out to be bunkum. The games are supposed to encourage us to play sport; they are meant to produce resounding economic benefits and help the poor. It's all untrue. As the evictions in London begin, a new report shows that the only certain Olympic legacy is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich.\n\nBoth Lord Coe and Tessa Jowell, the sports secretary, like the boosters for every city to have bid for the Olympics, have claimed that the games will lever us off our sofas and turn us into a nation of athletes. But Jowell knows this is nonsense. In 2002 her department published a report which found that \"hosting events is not an effective, value-for-money method of achieving ... a sustained increase in mass participation\". One study suggests that the Olympics might even reduce our physical activity: we stay indoors watching them on TV, rather than kicking a ball around outside. And this is before we consider the effects of draining the national lottery: Sport England will lose \u00a3100m.\n\nThe government's favourite thinktanks, Demos and the Institute for Public Policy Research, examined the claim that the Olympics produce a lasting economic boom. They found that \"there is no guaranteed beneficial legacy from hosting an Olympic games ... and there is little evidence that past games have delivered benefits to those people and places most in need\". Tessa Jowell must be aware of this as well - she wrote the forward to the report. A paper published by the London assembly last month found that \"long-term unemployed and workless communities were largely unaffected [by better job prospects] by the staging of the games in each of the four previous host cities\".\n\nFar more damning is a study released last week by the Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions. In every city it examined, the Olympic games - accidentally or deliberately - have become a catalyst for mass evictions and impoverishment. Since the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, more than 2 million people have been driven from their homes to make way for the Olympics. The games have become a licence for land grabs.\n\nThe 1988 games are widely seen as a great success. But they were used by the military dictatorship (which had ceded power in 1987) as an opportunity to turn Seoul from a vernacular city owned by many people into a corporate city owned by the elite - 720,000 people were thrown out of their homes; people who tried to resist were beaten by thugs and imprisoned; tenants were evicted without notice and left to freeze (some survived by digging caves into a motorway embankment); street vendors were banned; homeless people, those with mental health problems, alcoholics and beggars were rounded up and put into a prison camp. The world saw nothing of this: just a glossy new city full of glossy new people.\n\nBarcelona's Olympics, in 1992, are cited as a model to which all succeeding Olympic cities should aspire. But, though much less destructive than Seoul's, they were also used to cleanse the city. Roma communities were evicted and dispersed. The council produced a plan to \"clean the streets of beggars, prostitutes, street sellers and swindlers\" and \"annoying passers-by\". Some 400 poor and homeless people were subjected to \"control and supervision\". Between 1986 and 1992 house prices rose by 240% as the Olympic districts were gentrified, while the public housing stock fell by 76%. There was no consultation before the building began - the games were too urgent and important. Around 59,000 people were driven out of the city by rising prices.\n\nEven before the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta was one of the most segregated cities in the US. But the games gave the clique of white developers who ran them the excuse to engineer a new ethnic cleansing programme. Without any democratic process they demolished large housing projects (whose inhabitants were mostly African-American) and replaced them with shiny middle-class homes; about 30,000 families were evicted. They issued \"quality of life ordinances\", which criminalised people who begged or slept rough. The police were given pre-printed arrest citations bearing the words \"African-American, Male, Homeless\": they just had to fill in the name, charge and date. In the year before the games they arrested 9,000 homeless people. Many were locked up without trial until the games were over; others were harassed until they left the city. By the time the athletes arrived, downtown Atlanta had been cleared for the white middle classes.\n\nIn 2002, there was much less persecution of the poor, but the economic legacy was still regressive: house prices in Sydney doubled between 1996 and 2003. No provision was made for social housing in the Olympic village, and there were mass evictions from boarding houses and rented homes, which the authorities did nothing to stop. The old pattern resumed in Athens, where the Olympics were used as an excuse to evict 2,700 Roma, even from places where no developments were planned.\n\nIn Beijing 1.25 million people have already been displaced to make way for the games, and another quarter of a million are due to be evicted. Like the people of Seoul, they have been threatened and beaten if they resist. Housing activists have been imprisoned. One man, Ye Guozhu, is currently serving four years for \"disturbing social order\", and has reportedly been suspended by his arms from the ceiling of his cell and tortured with electric batons. Beggars, vagrants and hawkers have been rounded up and sentenced to \"re-education through labour\". The authorities are planning to hospitalise mentally ill people so that visitors won't have to see them.\n\nLondon is about to establish its credentials as a true Olympic city by evicting Gypsies and Travellers from Clays Lane in Newham and Waterden Crescent in Hackney: 430 people will be thrown out of the Clays Lane housing co-op and a 100-year-old allotment will be destroyed to make way for a concrete path that will be used for four weeks. Nine thousand new homes will be built for the games, but far more will be lost to the poor through booming prices, which are rising much faster around the Olympic site than elsewhere in London. The buy-to-let vultures have already landed.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee raises no objection to any of this. It lays down rigid criteria for cities hosting the games, but these do not include housing rights. How could they? City authorities want to run the games for two reasons: to enhance their prestige and to permit them to carry out schemes that would never otherwise be approved. Democratic processes can be truncated, compulsory purchase orders slapped down, homes and amenities cleared. The Olympic bulldozer clears all objections out of the way. There can be no debate, no exceptions, no modifications. Everything must go.\n\nNone of this is an argument against the Olympic games. It is an argument against moving them every four years. Let them stay in a city where the damage has already been done. And let it be anywhere but here.\n\n\u00b7 George Monbiot's book Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning is now out in paperback\n\nwww.monbiot.com", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/George-Monbiot,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=990d2a7f6735413fbba7def7c0853ad2", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Politics%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CCommunities%2CUK+news%2CSport%2CSociety%2CImmigration+and+asylum%2CRoma%2C+Gypsies+and+Travellers%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "11/06/2007"}, "rank_95": {"title": "Long on legacy, short on wow", "text": "This is a very simple building\", said Rod Sheard, architect in charge of the design of the London 2012 Olympic stadium. And, I must say, it's hard to disagree. If you like your Olympic stadiums like Beijing's next year, in the guise of a giant and strangely thrilling metal bird's nest, or like Athens's in 2004, in the form of a bucking bronco engineering rollercoaster ride, then the London stadium is unlikely to be your cup of green tea, much less your shot of ouzo.\n\nWhen Lord Coe unveiled the design yesterday, there was a breathless hush in the close-packed ranks of journalists assembled at the stadium site. You could have heard a hurdle drop. There was, though, no sudden burst of applause, not one \"wow!\"\n\nLondon, it seems, is taking no chances. Although described yesterday at the official unveiling, in a cruelly wind-scythed Stratford, as \"cutting edge\" by the mayor of London, \"a new blueprint for building Olympic stadia\" by Lord Coe and \"stunning\" by Tessa Jowell, the Olympics minister, the \u00a3496m design looked rather tame and not a little like a conservative version of the sort of thing pop-era architects of the 60s used to dream up in swinging London but never quite got to build.\n\nFearful of building a Dome mark two, the Olympic committee and its designers, architects HOK Sport and engineers Buro Happold, have come up with an 80,000-seat stadium that - hey presto! - will be cut down to size, to just 25,000 seats, with precious little fuss when the Olympic Games have come and gone. So, the stadium is basically a concrete bowl - the permanent bit - with tiers of temporary seats stacked above it, with the whole caboodle wrapped in plastic sheets shot through with the kind of whizzy digital electronic technology that will allow these short-lived walls to display any images, still or moving, the Olympic committee deems fit for global public consumption in summer 2012. Given over to clever video designers and artists, this could be immense fun, and even illuminating.\n\nAbove all, though, this safe, sensible and pragmatic design has clearly been driven by the dreaded \"L\" word. All six speakers at the press conference used it, with Ms Jowell very probably breaking the world record with three mentions in less than 30 seconds. Not even the dashing Seb Coe could have beaten her. The word is \"legacy\", all the vogue in the very political circles that shaped the dread Millennium Experience a decade ago.\n\nSadly, no one holding an official torch for the London Olympics was willing or able to describe this \"legacy\". Expect, though, a huddled mass of low-cost homes, thrusting, two-fingers-up office blocks, gaudy shopping malls, a splash of artistic \"water features\" and a quirky new park along the banks of the river Lea in the soft shadow of a small and sensible, all-purpose post-Olympic stadium. The stadium may well go on to host a circus or two, but, matter-of-fact and just a little mousey, this will certainly be no white elephant.\n\n\u00b7 Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=UK+news%2CArchitecture%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CCommunities%2CLondon%2CArt+and+design%2CCulture%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2007/11/07/pic2.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e2fdba4a6e109a56ea2586b6f9cb26c1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2007/11/07/pic2.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eca281faf724a1b90c46cf9ec947307c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2007/11/07/pic2.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eca281faf724a1b90c46cf9ec947307c", "date": "08/11/2007"}, "rank_71": {"title": "I can work with Coe and deliver London legacy, says Hoey", "text": "Labour MP Kate Hoey said last night that her appointment as Boris Johnson's Commissioner for Sport would bring a new focus on the sporting legacy of the London Olympics and insisted it would not prevent her working harmoniously with other stakeholders in the project.\n\nJohnson's election and Hoey's appointment mark a sea-change in the attitude of the mayor's office to the Olympics. Ken Livingstone saw the Olympic dividend for London in terms of the regeneration of east London but Johnson is likely to focus on the sporting legacy and on driving down costs.\n\nTo this end he will appoint a financial expert to work alongside Hoey as part of his Olympic monitoring team. The former sports minister's appointment is a controversial one, not least because during the bidding process she said Paris deserved the games more than London. Her frequent criticism of government sports policy also antagonised many in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport now involved in the Olympic project and her decision to accept a job from the Conservative mayor has angered some in the Labour party.\n\nHoey said her role would be to ensure the Olympics left a sporting legacy for London, a clear departure from the regeneration-focused tenure of the previous mayor. She will not officially represent the mayor on the London organising committee board but said she would attend meetings where the sporting legacy is discussed.\n\nAsked if she could foresee tension arising as a result of her appointment Hoey said: \"I can't foresee any problems. I think sport is one of those areas where there is the possibility of cross-party involvement. I am in politics to get things done and if that means working with people who have a different party label than me than so be it.\n\n\"I can work with Seb [Coe] without any problem. He has a very clearly defined role in that he has to deliver the games for the International Olympic Committee. I am not going to be involved in the financial elements of the Olympics or sidetracked by them. My involvement is really about the sporting legacy and ensuring that when the Olympics have departed that the people of London, be they in Barnet, Croydon or east London have something to show for it.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about the sporting legacy of the games but there is very little detail and no legacy plan yet. Sport has clearly not been a priority in the project but the new mayor believes that boosting sports participation is as important, if not more important, than regeneration.\"\n\nJohnson attended his first Olympic board meeting yesterday and he will meet the IOC for the first time next week when they visit London on an annual inspection of progress. His elevation is certain to change the political dynamics of the project. Previously the Olympic board was politically split between Tessa Jowell and Livingstone and the Conservative peers Lord Coe, chairman of the organising committee, and Lord Moynihan, chair of the British Olympic Association.\n\nCoe has resigned the Tory whip and is officially neutral, though in practice he is said to have often endorsed the government position to emphasise his neutrality. Moynihan, meanwhile, has battled for greater financial transparency over the budget and a greater focus on the sporting dividend of the games, often in vain.\n\nWith Johnson on the board he will have an ally, and he is close to Hoey having collaborated with her on an independent critique of government sports policy in 2005.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/04/29/katehoey1.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5aeb5c3b821223faa69aa100dbb7d2e6", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/04/29/katehoey1.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3376556e7f739e92180030503670434", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CSport%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2008/04/29/katehoey1.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3376556e7f739e92180030503670434", "date": "16/05/2008"}, "rank_221": {"title": "London 2012 Olympic stadium may not have an athletics legacy after all", "text": "Boris Johnson's plans for the legacy use of the Olympic stadium in Stratford look like undermining Britain's standing in international sport once again.\n\nTalks over what configuration the main 2012 stadium will have after the Olympics are increasingly distant from a pledge made to the Olympic and athletics governing bodies in 2005. The bid book delivered to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore in 2005 promised it, and the International Association of Athletics Federations, that London would maintain a fit-for-purpose athletics stadium in its East End.\n\nBut Johnson, the mayor of London whose London Development Agency has final say over post-Games use of facilities, admitted today that the athletics usage might not transpire.\n\n\"I will not dilate for a long time on the legacy prospects of the stadium,\" said Johnson. \"But this is still a story that is not closed; we should look at it and continue to explore all options. There has been considerable private-sector investment into the Bird's Nest [Olympic stadium in Beijing] and the investors hold a 30-year lease over the structure. This is something interesting. There are issues to do with their managing to attract football to the stadium but so far we have failed to do that in London.\"\n\nThe IOC and IAAF trust Stratford's stadium will become a compact, 25,000-seat facility that can hold athletics meets at full capacity. But Britain could become an international pariah again if renewed plans gather pace to bolt an athletics track on to what would be a larger football stadium. Athletics could only ever fill a 40,000-plus-seat venue to capacity during an Olympics; otherwise it would stand half empty.\n\nLondon's Singapore promise was in itself an attempt to assuage opposition from within the powerful IAAF after London had to withdraw from its hosting of the 2005 world athletics championship over the collapse of the Pickett's Lock stadium project. But since taking over as London's mayor from Ken Livingstone, Johnson has repeatedly insisted cost-savings must be made around the Olympics. And the insertion of a football tenant would certainly be the most viable option.\n\n\"It is very, very important to remember that we won the Games at a time of economic plenty and that we must deliver it against a background of a credit crunch, a downturn and a possible recession,\" said Johnson. \"We are seeking economies where we can but that does not mean this will be a penny-pinching, austerity Games.

Boris Johnson had previously said it would be too expensive to retain the stadium's maximum capacity of 80,000 and had backed plans for the venue to be reduced to 25,000.\n\n\"I'd be very foolish to rule it out now,\" said Johnson today. With Olympic organisers unable to find a football club to take residence in the stadium after 2012 it is estimated that the \u00a3547m development could cost \u00a310m annually to maintain. But with England bidding for the World Cup in 2018, Johnson hopes the Stratford site could become one of the 12 designated venues.\n\nSimilarly the Olympic Stadium could also stage matches if the International Rugby Board selects England as the host of the 2015 Rugby World Cup on 28 July.\n\n\"It's a very difficult technical subject, but anyone with any common sense looking at this wonderful venue we are constructing in Stratford will say, 'Why not?'\" said Johnson.\n\n\"It adds hugely to the attractions of London. London already boasts fantastic, incomparable sporting facilities. We are already a leading contender to have the 2018 World Cup and I think the stadium in the Olympic Park is well worth considering as an additional venue.\"\n\nArsenal's Emirates Stadium and Tottenham's planned new venue alongside White Hart Lane are also in contention to stage World Cup matches in London.\n\nRetaining the Stratford site as an 80,000-seat venue received key backing last week from Margaret Ford, who has become the head of the Olympic legacy board. Members of the London Assembly plan to press the mayor on how much it would cost to keep the stadium at 50,000 capacity, if not 80,000.\n\n\"We have a very interesting passage of argument ahead of us and Margaret Ford, who has just taken over as the chairman of the Olympic Park legacy company, has been absolutely right to raise this issue up the agenda \u2013 to look at the possibility of keeping the stadium going beyond 2012, 2013,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"I'm not going to say that's been decided because that would be wrong.

The Olympics minister ruled out the prospect of a Premier League club using the stadium but remains hopeful that a commercial tenant will be found.\n\n\"We don't need another football stadium, we have got Wembley,\" said Jowell, speaking at the Beyond Sport summit in Central London. \"Funding the maintenance of a stadium between 2012 and 2018 is quite a stretch, so I think we will continue to develop the plan that we have for the Olympic Stadium.\"\n\nJohnson said last week that it would be \"very foolish to rule out\" retaining at least a 50,000 capacity as England bids to host the 2018 World Cup but Jowell said organisers were committed to honouring their pledge to provide Britain with a 25,000-seat athletics venue. Sir Keith Mills, vice-chairman of 2012 and non-executive director of the 2018 bid, concurred that it \"would not be economically viable\" to retain the 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium.\n\nThe Olympic Legacy Committee, headed by Lady Margaret Ford and set up to oversee the Olympic project, was said to be examining the prospect of retaining a 50,000-capacity for the Stratford venue but Jowell reaffirmed continuity with the original plan that gained London the right to host the Games, in 2005.\n\n\"We made a very clear commitment in the bid book that the Olympic Stadium in legacy will be a 20- to 25,000-seater athletics stadium with the provision for a warm-up track so that London and indeed the UK will have a grand prix athletics stadium,\" she added. \"There is no Premier League football club with which we are in discussion about their long-term use of the Olympic Stadium.\n\nThe only confirmed tenants of the stadium are the English Institute of Sport and the National Skills Academy for Sport and Leisure, a \"concentration of sporting organisations promoting excellence\" that Jowell said will provide a \"fantastic legacy\" for the stadium.\n\nHowever, the minister is still hopeful that further commercial parties can be attracted in the wake of the Olympics: \"We are] probably four years away from the point when a new tenant will move into the stadium, probably more,\" she said. \"In the current commercial environment it is quite a big ask to say, 'Will you sign a contract for five years hence?'\"\n\nAlso attending the summit was the former prime minister Tony Blair, who said that, despite the economic downturn, he had absolutely no regrets that the London bid was successful. He does not see the stadium as the Games' greatest legacy but rather the impetus they can give to sport at a lower level.\n\n\"The stadium is something you have and the facilities. That's great but, let's be clear, it's still a relatively small number of people that will have access to that,\" he said. \"I think the important thing is to use it as a galvaniser for grass-roots sport.

Still, my failure to make the excursion until yesterday did mean it coincided with this year's 2012 Open Weekend and the special event on the Greenway. See what I saw, taking particular note of the Lyle's Golden Syrup artwork.\n\nThe yellow structure is temporary, though it was explained that the big bit will be a semi-permanent facility catering to site visitors (I think). The part of the Greenway beyond it, connecting up to Stratford High Street is closed off (pdf) until next spring while a stretch of road that runs beneath it is lowered. The big news since last time, though, is that the stadium's outer shell has been officially deemed complete. Meanwhile, the curvaceous skeleton of the aquatic centre - which ODA chairman John Armitt is particularly excited about - looks fully formed. For a good if fleeting view of it, take a North London Line train into Stratford station.\n\nWith three years to go, the permanent buildings seem to be rising from the dust on time. It's still not clear, however, what will happen to the stadium once August 2012 has been and gone. The original plan to reduce capacity from 80,000 to 25,000 is now under scrutiny. At Boris's public consultation meeting in Walthamstow last month Labour peer Baroness Margaret Ford, who chairs the newly-formed Olympic Legacy Delivery Company, said she wanted the stadium to be for both \"community and elite sports\" after the Games and that the trick was to \"get the balance right.\" In a subsequent interview she spoke of retaining the 80,000 capacity, seeing the stadium as a potential 2018 World Cup venue. In this she's sharing a hymn sheet efficiently with Seb Coe, who's now contributing to the England World Cup bid.\n\nIt's a tough circle - well, more of an oval - to square. Someone else with the matter on his mind is Dalston-dweller Andrew Boff AM, who speaks on the issue for the Assembly Conservatives. He's asked Mayor Johnson what it would cost to have the stadium's \"legacy capacity\" increased to 50,000. He's yet to receive an answer, and I predict that when he does it will be cagey.\n\nThe Football Association will settle on which stadiums to include in its bid at the end of this year. By then, Baroness Ford will hope to have come up with a major \"visitor attraction\" for the post-Games park, saying at the Walthamstow meeting that she'd be visiting local schools to seek ideas. She's got plenty else to think about too. As her fellow Walthamstow panelist Hackney's Mayor Jules Pipe put it, the legacy area in its entirety will be like half an additional London borough constructed in the space of just 20-odd years. Boris, of course, mustered an extravagant metaphor, describing the Games as \"a beast of burden that we can lasso to drive change and improvement.\"\n\nThe sheer scale of the enterprise is, indeed, gigantic. When pausing on my bike ride back home along the River Lea I tried to imagine it all fully-formed, stretching away southwards down the Lea Valley. I'll be a pensioner by the time it's finished. I look forward to visiting it in a handsome New Routemaster, travelling free thanks to my Freedom Pass, and thinking of the former Mayor Johnson, wherever and whatever he may be by then.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CLondon%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CLondon+politics%2CSebastian+Coe%2CRegeneration%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "26/07/2009"}, "rank_244": {"title": "Games tsar to ensure legacy of London 2012 Olympics", "text": "The government is to counter criticism that it is failing to deliver on the promises that helped win the 2012 Olympic Games for London by appointing a \"sports legacy tsar\", to get more people participating in sport and help attract private sector investment.\n\nMinisters are looking for a high-profile figure who could be a former Olympic athlete or an influential name who has experience of running a sporting body.\n\nWith the Olympic flame due to be lit in the new stadium in Stratford, east London, three years from tomorrow, there is increasing optimism that organisers will deliver the games on time and within the \u00a39.3bn budget, despite the impact of the recession. But opposition MPs and senior sports figures have told the Guardian that there remain serious questions over the legacy of the 2012 Games. In particular, there are concerns over promises to use the Olympics to increase sporting activity and fight obesity.\n\nCritics claim that \"four years have been wasted\" in devising a strategy to deliver on the promise of getting 1 million people taking part in more sport by 2012 and a broader pledge to get 1 million more participating in physical activity, including walking and gardening.\n\nOrganisations including the British Olympic Association and the CCPR (Central Council of Physical Recreation), which represents hundreds of governing bodies, have voiced concerns that plans to use the Olympics to make a \"once in a lifetime\" change in the population's sporting habits are yet to have any impact at grassroots level. The shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said: \"The lack of a proper strategy for delivering our participation promises is the single biggest problem with the Olympics.\"\n\nThe Liberal Democrat Olympic spokesman, Tom Brake, said \"alarm bells must be ringing in government\", which \"may have bitten off more than it can chew\". The CCPR chair, Brigid Simmonds, added: \"We have been saying for some time that the Olympics will have a long sunrise and a very short sunset. If we don't get it right, this huge opportunity will be lost. With three years to go, let's grasp it and let's get on with it.\" In response, it is understood that the sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, who remains confident that the targets can be achieved, plans to convene a new team led by a \"legacy tsar\" to co-ordinate sport participation.\n\nThe government believes that it has put all the necessary building blocks in place, including getting the various agencies working harmoniously and doubling sports funding in the three years since 2005, but acknowledges that a more co-ordinated national approach is required.\n\n\"Some regions are getting on and doing it and others are sitting back and waiting for something to happen,\" Sutcliffe said. \"It's got to be about inspiration as well. The athletes need to be out in their communities inspiring people.\"\n\nIt will also co-ordinate a drive to get private backers involved in the legacy push. Adidas will announce that it is rolling out its \"sportszone\" concept around the country following a trial in London, and there are hopes that other Olympic sponsors will want to get involved with legacy projects. Figures released last week by Sport England, the body charged with delivering the 1 million participation increase and investing \u00a3480m of lottery and public funds in grassroots sport between 2009 and 2013, revealed that progress appeared to have stalled.\n\nQuarterly figures showed that of 31 sports measured according to how many people played them at least once a week, only table tennis recorded an increase. Nine - including swimming, football, gymnastics and rowing - showed a decline and the rest showed no change.\n\nIn order to achieve its target, Sport England must boost the 6.8 million people playing sport for 30 minutes at least three times a week by 1 million. The other 1 million, to be delivered through other government agencies including the National Health Service, must be doing some form of physical activity for 30 minutes at least three times a week. Sport England argues that the quarterly survey is merely a guide and that the next annual survey, due in December, will give a clearer idea of progress under a plan launched earlier this year to invest the bulk of its lottery and public funds directly through sport governing bodies.\n\nIt was partly the bold legacy promises made by London Organising Committee chairman, Seb Coe, that the Olympics would transform the East End of London, inspire a generation of young people through sport and deliver health benefits for the entire nation that helped convince International Olympic Committee members to vote for the city in 2005.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CObesity%2CHealth+%26+wellbeing%2CLabour%2CLife+and+style%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2COlympics+%26+the+media%2CMedia%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2007/11/21/OlympicStadium460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMDkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b2f63ad99fd7c57f2427402a5f08cdde", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2007/11/21/OlympicStadium460.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2cd7ec4ac8ac43fdec664738ece3fe02", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2007/11/21/OlympicStadium460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMDkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b2f63ad99fd7c57f2427402a5f08cdde", "date": "26/07/2009"}, "rank_258": {"title": "Owen Gibson on the work being done to ensure that the London Olympics leaves a positive legacy", "text": "Support The Guardian\n\nThe Guardian is editorially independent.

The Government's own sports strategy document, Game Plan, concluded in 2002 that staging the Olympics was unlikely to address our modern health problems, caused by sedentary lifestyles and poor diet.\n\n\"Hosting events is not an effective, value for money method of achieving a sustained increase in participation,\" the government's document said, concluding there was \"limited evidence\" of the benefits of \"mega sporting events.\"\n\nYet still the claims were made.\n\nResearch from previous Olympics has shown that while people generally do love watching great athletes run round tracks or swim impossibly fast, they are not then inspired to take up sport themselves. The reasons why some people are physically active and others are not are rooted in their social, cultural and economic circumstances, not because they do not have enough opportunities to watch elite athletes on television or in a stadium.\n\nIn Britain, we have a big problem: official figures show that a dismal one in five people, 21%, do half an hour's moderate exercise - including walking - three times a week. We invest much less in sport per head than other developed countries including Finland, where a public health programme begun in 1972 gradually transformed the population into the world's most active, where 55% of people exercise three times a week or more.\n\nCoe, lucky for him, is not responsible for making good on the legacy claim. As the chairman of Locog, he will be judged on whether the Games themselves are a success in 2012. Responsibility for the very difficult target of seeing a million more people doing sport by then, has fallen to Sport England.\n\nGood intentions do abound to improve sports provision and facilities, and to use the power of the Olympics to inspire young people. Advocates for the Olympics argue that, importantly, winning the Games has raised sport's profile generally and focused minds in the government and local authorities on the need to improve participation. Strides are being made in schools, where the Labour government has committed \u00a32.3bn to revitalising sport from 2003-11, in a sustained effort to recover from years of desperate underfunding by the previous Conservative government. Now, 90% of pupils do the set two hours PE a week, a wholesale improvement following the wretched decline under the Conservatives.\n\nOutside schools, Sport England has allocated \u00a3480m of lottery and treasury funding over the next four years to 46 sports, which have developed \"whole sport plans\" to boost numbers. The free swimming for over 65s initiative has been backed by \u00a3140m government cash.\n\nYet all of that still amounts to a fraction of the \u00a39.3bn budget just for hosting the Olympics. Although some of the facilities will be available for ordinary people to use afterwards, such as the aquatic centre, the Games have actually sucked money away from public sport - \u00a3547m was diverted from Sport England's budget.\n\nThe heart of the matter is that particularly after young people leave school, their physical health, and whether they are likely to continue to take part in sport, depends greatly on wealth and education.\n\nThe poor are stubbornly less active than the relatively well off, for a range of reasons which are obvious to identify \u2013 low income, limited horizons, poor neighbourhoods, bad diet, rundown local sports facilities \u2013 but tough to address without real political will. That is the key reason why we compare so badly to Finland and the other Scandinavian countries: ours is a more unequal society. Our figure of 21% doing regular exercise has barely moved since 1990. Sport England registered an increase between 2006 and 2008, but the most recent figures are static or, in some sports, down.\n\nThat wider social inequality, which underpins the divide between those who have always participated in sport, like Coe, and those who generally do not, is the truly difficult challenge for politicians to address. It is much easier to charm an IOC audience with a legacy vision, when bidding to host the Games.\n\nEfforts are undoubtedly being made, yet the Olympics in London are unlikely to inspire a new generation to be more active, unless accompanied by huge investment and determination. For three weeks in the summer of 2012, though, watching top athletes achieve great things will make a lot of people feel better about life, at least for a while.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/7/27/1248700039822/Visitors-view-the-ongoing-001.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5c28fdce9e7eccb0338568cb46152012", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/7/27/1248700039822/Visitors-view-the-ongoing-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c474d70f704a467b18be9e10b063793f"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2009/7/27/1248700039822/Visitors-view-the-ongoing-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c474d70f704a467b18be9e10b063793f", "date": "27/07/2009"}, "rank_264": {"title": "2012 London Olympics social legacy matters more than sport", "text": "Yesterday's PR event featuring the javelin train ride from St Pancras to Stratford seems to have hit its targets, with upbeat talk from Boris, Tessa and Seb finding its way into the Guardian, the Telegraph and across the pond to the Washington Examiner.\n\nI'm happy about this: most media negativity about the Games is boring and self-srving. I'm also determinedly hopeful that at least some of those many legacy promises will come true. What are their chances?\n\nThe ones I've always been most pessimistic about are, alas, those anticipating increased participation in sport. In Walthamstow last month Seb Coe talked about returning to his athletics club, Enfield and Haringey wreathed in Olympic laurels and seeing queues of kids outside longing to emulate his feats. The sad thing, he said, was that the club's coaches knew there simply weren't enough of them to meet the demand.\n\nA good story and no doubt true, but David Conn's sobering note yesterday struck a chord with me:\n\nResearch from previous Olympics has shown that while people generally do love watching great athletes run round tracks or swim impossibly fast, they are not then inspired to take up sport themselves. The reasons why some people are physically active and others are not are rooted in their social, cultural and economic circumstances, not because they do not have enough opportunities to watch elite athletes on television or in a stadium.\n\nWill the 2012 Games improve those life circumstances for many people, especially in hard-up East London? For me, that's the most important question of all. The video clip below, taken on Saturday, features a view of the stadium from the bank of a very green River Lea, a plug for the quality bloggers of Leabank Square and a look at the space where the media centre will soon start to rise from the ground. Note the two-tier wire fencing that has recently replaced all that blue wooden fencing.\n\nAlthough the media centre's capacity will be less than originally planned it will still be as capacious as a Canary Wharf tower lying down. Hackney Council is anxious - as Paul Norman assiduously documents here - that the post-Games use of the centre as a film and media creative hub will generate lots of high-quality local jobs for residents of a borough with ingrained high unemployment. That will be one of the true tests of the 2012 Games legacy. If it passes, the running, jumping and swimming will follow.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=London%2CLondon+politics%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympics+%26+the+media%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "28/07/2009"}, "rank_106": {"title": "Government's 2012 Olympics claims are hollow, say opposition MPs", "text": "Opposition MPs yesterday accused the government of failing to deliver on its Olympic sporting legacy promises after \"disastrous\" new Sport England figures revealed participation in both codes of rugby, gymnastics, rowing and six other sports fell in the last year.\n\nThe new quarterly figures, which showed that just three sports \u2013 athletics, canoeing and cycling \u2013 had recorded an increase in the number of people participating at least once a week and that the rest had remained static, were immediately seized on by those who claim the government's strategy is failing.\n\nIt was partly the promise to increase by two million by 2012 the 6.8m people playing sport or doing some form of physical exercise for 30 minutes three times a week that helped win the Games for London. \"These disastrous figures show the government's Olympic legacy strategy is going badly wrong. Many sports which have had huge funding increases are actually witnessing a decline in participation,\" said Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat shadow culture, media and sport secretary. \"There are also worrying drops in participation among women and the disabled \u2013 two of the government's target groups.\"\n\nSport England and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport argue that a new strategy to funnel \u00a3480m into grassroots sport through governing bodies in the four years to 2013 has not had enough time to take effect and point to the fact that sports funding doubled in the three years to 2008. And it says top-line figures that show that the number of adults playing sport for 30 minutes for more than three times a week \u2013 the means by which the \"legacy promises\" will be measured \u2013 have increased to 6.9m.\n\nBut the quarterly tracking figures measuring participation once a week on a sport-by-sport basis show that golf, gymnastics, movement and dance, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, sailing, snow sports, swimming and volleyball all showed a \"statistically significant\" decline when compared to the previous year.\n\n\"This government is entirely failing to build on the opportunities which London 2012 provides and seems to have no idea how to create the legacy for sport we promised when we won the bid in Singapore,\" said the Tory shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson. \"The fact that swimming participation overall has fallen only goes to prove that the free swimming initiative, which was the centrepiece of the government's sport legacy plans, has failed abysmally.\"\n\nEarlier this year, organisations including the British Olympic Association and the Central Council of Physical Recreation, which represents hundreds of governing bodies, said they had concerns that the promised legacy in terms of sports participation and new venues was being squandered.\n\nTo achieve its target, Sport England must boost the 6.8m people playing sport for 30 minutes at least three times a week by one million. The other one million, to be delivered through other government agencies including the National Health Service, must be doing some form of physical activity for 30 minutes at least three times a week. That too came in for criticism when it emerged that activities such as decorating and \"active conservation\" would be included in the total. \"We are at the start of a four-year period that will see \u00a3480m invested in 46 sports to get more people playing and enjoying sport,\" said a Sport England spokesman. \"This latest snapshot covers only the first four months of this period \u2026 \"\n\nSport England argues that the quarterly survey is merely a guide and that the next annual survey, due in December, will give a clearer idea of progress under a plan launched earlier this year to invest the bulk of its lottery and public funds directly through sport governing bodies.\n\nA DCMS spokesman added: \"Participation in sport in the last year has gone up. The figures from Sport England show an increase in the last nine months of approaching 90,000, building on a rise in the previous two years of half a million. We recognise that turning round the global trend towards inactivity is a big challenge for us all \u2013 but we have a strategy in place that is well-funded and delivering results, including over 4.4m free visits to local pools as part of the government's free swimming initiative.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2009/9/10/1252617876142/British-gymnast-Beth-Twed-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMDkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3926b731b87e8a98c4a75d344503d61e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2009/9/10/1252617876142/British-gymnast-Beth-Twed-001.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2dde76f9b109442f7fe05730858ebbd9"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2009/9/10/1252617876142/British-gymnast-Beth-Twed-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMDkucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3926b731b87e8a98c4a75d344503d61e", "date": "10/09/2009"}, "rank_231": {"title": "Legacy is the story for 2012, says Coe", "text": "Sebastian Coe has defended efforts to secure a sports participation legacy from the London 2012 Olympics in the face of criticism from MPs and sporting figures, but warned more needed to be done to \"tell the story in a coherent way\".\n\nCoe's vision for an Olympics that could help inspire a generation of young people helped win the 2012 Games \u2013 of which he is chairman \u2013 for London and the government subsequently promised to get two million more people doing sport or taking part in more physical activity by 2013.\n\nThe most recent figures from Sport England, which is investing \u00a3480m in grassroots sport over the next four years, show that only three sports had recorded an increase in participation in the past year.\n\nThe government has argued the investment needs time to take effect but others claim the participation plans are ill-focused and failing to deliver. Earlier this month, Sir Steve Redgrave was appointed as a sports legacy \"champion\" by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in order to act as a figurehead for the drive.\n\n\"The legacy from sports participation is a better story than is currently being told,\" Coe told the London Assembly. \"My concern for some time is that we are not collating that narrative as well as we could be. My experience of travelling widely throughout schools in London and the UK is that national governing bodies, local education authorities and agencies have risen to this challenge. I hope we are properly gathering the information that will enable us to tell the story in a coherent way come 2012.\"\n\nBut Coe also made clear that it was not the organising committee's job to drive increased sports participation, despite the fact he is personally closely associated with the promises he made in Singapore in 2005.\n\n\"It is deep in my DNA to want to see more people play sport at the end of this process and, if you're pressing me, that's why I went to Singapore. But I also went to Singapore to make a presentation on behalf of three other stakeholders. This was not a bidding committee message alone - I delivered it on behalf of this organisation [the Assembly], the government and the British Olympic Association. It is very important that the coherent strategy is understood among those responsible for delivering it,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue for me is using our branding and using our programmes to drive some of these legacies, but also making sure the organisations directly responsible are doing that. I am satisfied that is now taking place.\"\n\nAt a later meeting of the Assembly's economic development, culture, sport and tourism committee, the chair of the new Olympic Park Legacy Company promised to deliver a report on the future of the main stadium by December.\n\nFierce debate has surrounded the fate of the stadium after the Games and whether or not it should be reduced from 80,000 to 28,000 capacity as originally planned, or maintained for possible use as a venue at the 2015 Rugby World Cup or in England's bid for the 2018 World Cup.\n\n\"People talk about the problems with having a running track.

But is it simply about a fortnight in August 2012, or is there much more at stake? I'll be enjoying the Olympics and Paralympics as a sports fan but, like Lord Coe, I am more concerned in the longer term with the legacy of the games.\n\nThe games will transform London forever. They will create a major new city centre at the heart of the planned Thames Gateway metropolis; and they could transform attitudes to health, fitness and wellbeing by improving access to sports. This is a once in a generation chance to shape the future destiny of a city, the communities, neighbourhoods and its citizens. London taxpayers are contributing to the games and therefore should be driving this forward.\n\nLet me touch on the two most important legacies: sports and the Olympic Park.\n\nSports legacy is a thorny issue. No Olympics has resulted in a greater uptake of sport by people living in the host city beyond the first few weeks after the games. This is akin to \"the Wimbledon effect\", a reference to those who spurred on by the tennis tournament take out their rackets in June only to put them away at the end of July. Kate Hoey has been charged by the mayor with the not so simple task of developing a sports legacy. All want a concerted effort to improve access to sport for those with disabilities, those who can't afford it and those who for cultural, religious or psychological reasons can't find appropriate sports sessions eg single-gender swimming.\n\nLondon has three years to find innovative ways of promoting sport and paying for access to it. Communities, government and business need to work together. It benefits us all \u2013 individuals feel better and live longer, businesses have a healthier workforce and the state has a reduced public health bill. The Olympic Park combined with neighbouring Stratford City will create a Thames Gateway capital. Londoners can still shape this new city. Baroness Ford, the new Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) chair raised concerns recently that the park should have more affordable and family housing or risked becoming a second Canary Wharf.\n\nResidents living in the park's vicinity have to benefit from it for the park to rejuvenate one of the poorest areas of the capital. Engagement with local communities by the OPLC is to be applauded but residents need to take up that opportunity or louder voices might prevail. There are many questions over the park's future use including that of the stadium. The current orthodoxy is that it will be downsized from an 80,000 to a 28,000 athletics venue; other ideas include a cricket stadium or an England World Cup 2018 bid venue. Olympic stadiums \u2013 as with the Millennium Dome \u2013 always risk being a one-minute wonder. It has taken almost a decade for the dome to become the successful 02 Arena venue.\n\nThe Olympics will no doubt demonstrate that Britain can deliver a world event. However, for the legacy to be a success, Londoners should engage with the Olympic authorities now, because by 2012 it will be too late to influence the shape of this city for decades to come.\n\nAlexander Goldberg is on the Jewish Committee for the London Games and writes here in a personal capacity.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CSport%2CHealth+%26+wellbeing%2CLife+and+style%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "29/10/2009"}, "rank_246": {"title": "Olympic Park legacy company board members named", "text": "The Olympic legacy company's job might be vulgarly described as to make sure that all that money sunk into 2012 doesn't go waste.

Today, the Labour MP has given an interview to London's Evening Standard which is likely to anger 2012 officials even more.\n\nBlimey. What has Boris's sports commissioner said?\n\nHoey has attacked the Government for forgetting the promises made about changing the sporting face of Britain when 2012 made their pitch to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore in 2005. Remember the emotional film about inspiring children worldwide to take up sport? She even claims that London chairman Lord Coe regrets using the word \"legacy\".\n\nWell, the Labour MP for Vauxhall always done things her own way. She also says:\n\nI will be opposed to the [Olympic] stadium just being handed over to a football club. I'm very happy for West Ham, or even better for Leyton Orient to be there. But I would like to have local community use of the stadium. Football stadiums are busier on non-match days in Europe. During the day nothing happens at Wembley. I'm aware somebody has to keep their eye on football or the public purse will get literally screwed.\n\nAnd then:\n\nI think there has been a government failure on legacy. They have not said what they mean. Some people within government have taken their eye of the ball because they are concentrating on the Olympic Park and have forgotten the promises made in Singapore.\n\nShe's talking the sports participation legacy, of course - her job is to help make sure there is one. This is the aspect of the Games I'm most pessimistic about. My grumpy expectation is that they will inspire almost no one to take up sport for much more than a week. If you want to invest in helping people to get fitter, how about funding more wardens in parks and ensuring fewer cars are on the streets?\n\nUncertainties also surround the other part of \"legacy\" - buildings, land, sustainable communities and all that.

Documents obtained under Freedom of Information (FOI) rules reveal that, contrary to government guidelines, waste from thorium and radium has been mixed with very low-level waste and buried in a so-called disposal cell close to the Olympic stadium - about 250m to the north.\n\nAfter the Games, the demolition of the Olympic stadium in Stratford to make way for housing is a possibility because government and sporting authorities so far have been unable to agree on its future use. Despite a possible bidding war between AEG, which runs the O2, and Live Nation to possibly turn the stadium into a music venue, bookmaker William Hill recently made demolition of the Olympic stadium 5/1 third favourite behind its continued use for athletics or conversion into a home ground for West Ham United. \"There seems to be no obvious usage for the stadium after the games,\" a William Hill spokesman said.\n\nBut while officials insist there is no risk from the waste to athletes or spectators during the event, further development of the site could expose the waste, which some experts claim should have been moved to a safe site.\n\nJohn Large, an independent nuclear analyst, said: \"The Olympic site's hurried and unplanned development may have resulted in a great deal of public harm to the local communities remaining around the site. Overall, there is some doubt about the applicability and validity of the radiological risk analysis undertaken for the future legacy use.\"\n\nHis sentiment is shared by Andrew Boff, a member of the London Assembly and Conservative spokesman on the Olympics. \"I thought the \u00a39.3bn cost would provide a remediation level sufficient for future development. But what we are left with is remediation which is just enough for us to hold the Games. The ODA is very proud that it came in under budget on remediation. I wish it had spent the whole amount and made the site fit for the future.\"\n\nAssessment\n\n\n\nBoff is tabling questions for London mayor Boris Johnson on the Olympics site. He wants to know if the mayor will commission an independent review of the way in which radioactive material has been disposed of and he also wants the mayor to ask the Olympic Park Legacy Company, responsible for transforming the site into a lasting metropolitan area once the Games are over, to investigate the additional costs of remediation that may be required for redevelopment.\n\nDevelopers are concerned that a complete reassessment of the site would have to be carried out for any future work to go ahead. Steve Wielebski, divisional development director at Miller Homes and a leading authority on contaminated land, said any housebuilder will want to examine any contaminated land carefully before constructing new homes.\n\n\"There are many safeguards put in place by the planning and regulatory regime, which ensure that a finished development is fit for purpose. However, if a subsequent development represented a change of use to a more sensitive end-use, for instance the construction of houses with gardens, then the developers would need to go through the whole process again of assessing the potential risk to end users,\" Wielebski said. \"No house builder will compromise on safety.\"\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company said: \"Our assurance from the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is that the land has been remediated to the highest possible standard.\"\n\nThe site where the world's greatest athletes will compete in two years' time was once home to several dirty industries working with thorium and radium and also home to a number of landfill sites, where illegal dumping of toxic waste was commonplace in the 1950s and early 1960s. Although the Radioactive Substances Act of 1960 tightened the law, dumping was allowed to continue for another three years.\n\nIn July 2008, the ODA told the Environment Agency that it had found 40 cubic metres, about 50 tonnes, of waste that showed radioactive readings up to three times higher than the levels at which waste is treated as exempt. But it argued that when put together with 1,500 cubic metres of material that was \"definitely exempt\" this would bring the whole waste into the exempt category.\n\nThe Agency accepted this argument in July 2008. By the time the waste was buried on the site three months later the total waste had doubled to about a hundred tonnes and the total exempt waste had risen to 7,500 tonnes.\n\n\"Overall contamination levels in the waste at the Olympic site is within exempt levels. The waste has been correctly disposed of and no rules, or laws, have been broken,\" the Environment Agency said.\n\nMuch of this information is contained in a dossier of hundreds of documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by campaigner Mike Wells and intelligence analyst Paul Charman, who have spent more than three years trying to establish what has been going on at the Olympic site where 28,000 documents have been submitted for planning approval.\n\nDisposal\n\n\n\nThe dossier has been reviewed by John Large, who has been engaged to analyse the data. He said: \"As part of the on-site assaying, the ODA contractors were clearly separating out exempt waste from non-exempt batches of low-level waste with the intention, then, of sending this higher [radio]activity non-exempt waste to a radioactive waste disposal site, such as Drigg [in Cumbria].\"\n\nHe continued: \"At the best, this might be interpreted as a misplaced interpretation of the radioactive waste regulations or, at the worse, some might view it as blatantly cooking the books to save on the high cost of off-site radioactive waste disposal.\"\n\nThe ODA denied that it had misinterpreted or manipulated data and Allan Ashworth, the principal consultant who oversaw the remediation work on the Olympic Park, said it was the Environment Agency that had encouraged the elevated radioactive waste to be kept on site in a disposal cell. \"EA guidance says the waste should stay on site and Drigg should only be used where strictly necessary,\" Ashworth said.\n\nAsked about Ashworth's claim, the EA said: \"The waste did not go to Drigg because it is so low risk.\"\n\nThe discovery of so much waste has prompted John Large to call for an independent review to remove any doubts about risks that workers and former site residents may have been exposed to.\n\nBut the ODA director of infrastructure and utilities, Simon Wright, said: \"The Olympic Park and all venue sites are completely safe with no radiation measurements above the normal background levels that people would experience in their everyday lives.\n\n\"We have been open and transparent about the contamination found on the Olympic Park site, a former industrial landfill site. As previously announced, a small amount of soil containing traces of very low-level radioactive material, classed as 'exempt' under current environmental law, has been safely buried in a cell on site \u2026 using a proven, safe and approved method of disposing of such material.\"\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 21 June and 12 October 2010. The original said that the waste in question had been buried \"under, or close, to the Olympic stadium\", and a sub-heading said that this could render the Olympic site useless after the 2012 Games. This was initially corrected to give a distance of 500m from the stadium. The ODA subsequently confirmed that the distance was 250m.

The International Broadcasting Centre and Main Press Centre are now fully-formed edifices on which the post-Games regeneration hopes of Hackney Council are pinned.\n\nI think I spotted one of the Leabank Square bloggers on the opposite bank of the Lea canal, wielding a watering can. The view residents used to enjoy is now embedded in history. Further down the towpath we turned on to the Greenway, the path that takes you past the stadium towards Stratford. It's been smartly refurbished and there's a pleasant cafe with more than one chirpy Antipodian among its staff. The bacon and egg rolls are good. So is the view, which also includes the aquatic centre and the stilting athletes's village. Everything still appears to be on schedule. But what are the prospects for the post-Games legacy?\n\nThe latest tale of Games finances is that the new government is \"re-examining\" the deal struck between Boris Johnson and the previous administration. The Treasury had agreed to cough up \u00a3438 million. Part of this was to relieve the recently-formed Olympic Park Development Company of \u00a3138 million of debt it would otherwise have inherited from the London Development Agency, which originally purchased the land on which the Park now stands.\n\nOPLC chair, Baroness Margaret Ford, has urged the Con-Libs to stick with the original plan in order not to deter future investors. The plan is that 10,000 new homes will eventually be built in the Park and its surrounding areas - homes that London will desperately need.\n\nLondon Assembly members heard earlier this month from regeneration experts who believe public subsidy is vital if major projects are to succeed in the long term. The Baroness will have her fingers crossed. Much still hangs in the balance, not least the future of the stadium itself. At least it seems we can be confident that the Park will be graced by a Great British Garden, complete with Great British Frogs.

While conceding there would be significant cuts as part of the government's drive to tackle the deficit, he said a new \"community sports legacy plan\" would divert lottery funding into a new scheme designed to protect sports facilities up and down the country.\n\nIt was announced yesterday that Sport England would be merged with UK Sport, the elite funding body as part of the government's cost-cutting drive. The two bodies both distribute National Lottery money to sport \u2013 UK Sport funds elite Olympic athletes and promising sports stars while Sport England funds grassroots sports in terms of facilities and coaching but only in England rather than across the whole of the UK.\n\nRobertson said there were further efficiency gains to be made that would not affect the front line, outlining plans to close the central London offices of Sport England, UK Sport and the Youth Sport Trust in 2012 and co-locate them outside the capital to save on rent and back\u2011office costs. He said the level of exchequer funding would be cut but hopes a combination of changes to the lottery, which he predicts will boost sport's share of the take by \u00a3100m by 2012, and a new scheme to persuade sport to invest more of its TV income in grassroots sport would compensate.\n\nThe former culture secretary Andy Burnham has claimed the cuts, particularly as they relate to sports projects within health and education and to local authority investment in facilities, would result in the \"hollowing out of sport as in the Conservative 1980s and the Olympic legacy being thrown away\". The UK Sport chairwoman, Sue Campbell, told the Observer that failing to preserve a legacy for elite sport by maintaining funding at close to the current levels would be \"shameful\".\n\n\"I recognise it's going to be a real challenge to deliver it [the legacy] in the current economic environment. But I do believe very much that if you make promises you should then deliver them,\" Robertson said.\n\nRobertson vowed to try to protect the \u00a3304m in exchequer and lottery funding earmarked for British athletes for the four years to 2013 but could offer no guarantees beyond that. And he said he would seek to honour a pledge by the previous government to maintain the \u00a3480m investment into grassroots sport through governing bodies over the four years to 2013.\n\nThe rest of Sport England's budget will be refocused to concentrate purely on 2012 legacy projects.\n\n\"We're coming at this from a standing start. It was not the last government's policy to get Sport England to do this, it is ours. They have come up with plans that we are now market testing and integrating those plans with what Locog and the BOA are doing. What I don't want is lots and lots of tiny legacy plans going off all over the landscape. I want a very clear direction of travel from government that all the delivery partners can buy into. With a bit of luck, you'll get it by the end of October.\"\n\nBut the rest of Sport England's budget \u2013 currently dispersed in the form of small grants and through a series of \"themed rounds\" \u2013 would be focused directly on a \"community sports legacy plan\", he said.\n\n\"There will undoubtedly be some tightening in the sector. We are where we are in all of this. Even the greatest advocates of the current system would say it works well and has achieved a lot but it's mushroomed out in quite a way. There is probably a sensible balance between where we are now and the worst case public expenditure settlement,\" he said.\n\nHe had originally promised to deliver a 2012 participation legacy plan by this month but said it made no sense to do so before the Comprehensive Spending Review in October. Under the government-wide cutbacks, sport is likely to face significant budget cuts.\n\n\"When I took over this job, one I have wanted all my life, I didn't want to have to spend my whole time with my nose in a budget sheet \u2013 which is largely what has happened in the last two months. But I have a plan to get us through this, which is to increase the money that comes through the lottery, where I can to help them raise more money through broadcast income and sponsorship and to make the case for sport across government. We are in the middle of the process at the moment, so I can make no promises, but I am doing everything I can to get sport through this.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2010/7/26/1280171304409/Hugh-Robertson-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cd4e4ea7ae6b87661006be7b6428b109", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2010/7/26/1280171304409/Hugh-Robertson-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b84a7baaf0f36ed6278ad16be6128a30", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport+England%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2010/7/26/1280171304409/Hugh-Robertson-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cd4e4ea7ae6b87661006be7b6428b109", "date": "26/07/2010"}, "rank_266": {"title": "2012 Olympics: legacy in the balance", "text": "Was it just me or did yesterday's mass anticipation of London 2012 almost totally forget the social and economic \"legacy\" that the Games are supposed to betroth to the East End?

The landscaped East London territory itself, with its sports stadiums and quintet of newbuild neighbourhoods, is to be called the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. This naming, we were told, was of a piece with the latest park masterplan's guiding concept, which is to model it upon the great private estates that still define much of the capital's social character, with their mix of grand homes for the affluent and only in some cases benevolence towards residents of more modest means. Boris Johnson spoke of emulating \"the most attractive features of the Georgian age.\"\n\nThis thoroughly Tory reading of London's past should come as no surprise, given that they are now so much in charge. And while the verbal branding will please royalists and harrumphing anti-modernist aesthetes, it's too early to conclude from a single press conference that the promise that the games will drive the regeneration of East London is being watered down.\n\nYet I find my dogged Olympics optimism more and more besieged by doubts. Is that terrible decision to re-route the marathon a sign of things to come? London's successful bid to host the 2012 games owed more than a little to promises that the sporting bonanza would be the driver for the rejuvenation of the East End, providing the new jobs and homes that so many locals need. It's been confirmed that more family homes with gardens will be built than had previously been planned, and given London's chronic problems with overcrowding it's hard not to applaud.\n\nBut how many of those homes will end up occupied by East End families in long-term need and how many by those with enough money to buy them? The Company says it is responding to \"market, community and public demand\" and that families will be the bedrock of fine urban districts containing schools, public spaces and businesses connected up with transport links. If these new East End neighbourhoods are to work for the East End, that blend of ingredients, including the human beings, has to be just right. How interested will developers be in building homes that truly are \"affordable?\" How many will be for social rent? How determined are Conservative politicians to ensure that this new \"great estate\" helps enough of those who most need it?\n\nBoris confirmed this morning that the Legacy Company \"is shortly to become the Mayoral Development Corporation\" as part of a package of new powers to be devolved to City Hall. His housing policy as mayor has redefined the definition of affordability to offer a hand up to people earning more than \u00a370,000 a year. Meanwhile critics of his proposed new London Plan - the capital's key strategic planning document - say that its house building targets are too low and will give boroughs too much freedom to drag their feet.\n\nThis morning I put it to Boris and Department of Work and Pensions minister Bob Neill that the government's controversial housing benefit plans - which London Councils now believes could result in over 80,000 London households having to move - showed it hasn't the first idea about Legacy Company chief executive Andrew Altman called \"London's DNA\", which has historically determined that even the richest parts of town have never wholly excluded the less well off.\n\nThe Mayor assured me that the government understood London's special circumstances, and expressed confidence that \"serious measures\" were forthcoming to address the situation. \"We think that there are more measures that we could introduce to mitigate the impact on people who absolutely have to live in certain neighbourhoods because their kids are in school or because they need to work nearby, and that is also something that is being readily understood by government,\" he said.\n\nThat's very interesting news, especially the part referring to schools and jobs. Whether it bodes well for the future of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, time will tell.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=London%2CPolitics%2CLondon+politics%2CRegeneration%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSociety%2CCommunities%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "07/10/2010"}, "rank_45": {"title": "2012 Olympics: 'unresolved' debt and legacy", "text": "Estates Gazette Olympics expert Paul Norman:\n\nThe London Assembly has drawn attention to one of the elephants currently stuck in the Olympics room.

Members will consider rival bids by West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur football clubs to take over the main stadium after the games. A crucial difference between the offers is that West Ham would preserve the arena, complete with running track, and modify it to suit the needs of a football stadium. Spurs would demolish it and build something more fundamentally soccer-friendly.\n\nMost football fans agree that athletics lanes spoil their view. Spurs says it would compensate runners by investing in athletics infrastructure in Crystal Palace. But removing the track from east London would be a clear breach of the commitment to make the Olympic park \"a purpose-built home for athletics for generations to come\".\n\nSpurs' main backer is US entertainment giant AEG, which has its eyes on the site as a concert venue. West Ham has event company Live Nation on board for similar reasons, but also has financial support from Newham council, the local borough. That local connection is vital. The Tottenham bid is commercially punchier \u2013 who pays to see athletics these days? \u2013 but it is also mercenary. Whoever takes over the site will inherit fabulous infrastructure and transport links, funded by the taxpayer. The decision about who should benefit must be about more than commerce. It is easy to see why AEG would like a piece of that action, and why it makes sense for them to make Spurs the vehicle. But Tottenham is a place, not a brand. Its football club shouldn't be uprooted to chase a nice little earner for the proprietors.\n\nMeanwhile, the promise was of an Olympic legacy for athletics and for east London, which presumably extends to its historic sporting institutions.

Days before tickets go on sale amid events to mark 500 days until the opening ceremony, relations between the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and the BOA, which is responsible for 550 athletes and 450 officials at Games-time, have hit a new low.\n\nBOA executives appeared increasingly isolated on Wednesday after Locog, chaired by Lord Coe, hit out at its attempt to squeeze more money from the joint marketing programme agreement drawn up by the two organisations in 2004.\n\nThe BOA, facing a funding shortfall of millions in the run-up to the Games, said that its complaint to the IOC was not about filling that hole but was designed to ensure that any surplus would return to sport after the Games and establish a \"lasting legacy\".\n\nIt wants the Olympic Games and the Paralympics to be considered separately for budgetary purposes and for any surplus from the former to flow back to the BOA and to not be used to subsidise the Paralympics.\n\nThe BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, and the chief executive, Andy Hunt, have long argued that the agreement signed after London won the Games undervalues the rights that were subleased to Locog in return for \u00a319m in cash and around \u00a312m in benefits in kind from sponsors. Hunt has described it as a \"straitjacket\" and claimed other host Olympic committees have received several times more. In a rare public criticism of one of its partners, Locog pointedly criticised the \"new leadership\" of the BOA.\n\n\"The vision for London 2012, created by the BOA, government and the mayor of London and set out in the bid book is for one festival of sport, with an integrated Olympic and Paralympic Games, underpinned by a single budget,\" Locog said in a statement. \"It is sad that this vision is now disputed by the new leadership of the BOA. We are grateful that the IOC is helping to resolve the issue.\"\n\nThe government is also likely to take a dim view of the insinuation that British sport is likely to be left in the lurch following the Games, after funding for elite sport and the Olympics was largely protected in the recent spending review process.\n\nBOA insiders say they have been trying to seek clarification on the issue for more than two years and that the dispute is about securing the best deal for British sport after the Games. \"This is about protecting the future for athletes, for sport and for our National Governing Bodies. We are doing exactly what every National Olympic Committee is expected to do: we are safeguarding a future sports legacy in our country,\" the BOA said.\n\n\"This has absolutely nothing to do with addressing our funding requirements for 2011 and 2012. We have a plan in place to generate those revenues and are confident we will do so.\"\n\nUnder the IOC's rules, any surplus left over after the Games \u2013 once the government received repayment for certain limited portions of the budget \u2013 should be used for \"the greater good of sport\". However, critics believe that the BOA has failed to manage its budget effectively and is therefore casting around for new ways to fund an expanded role in performance-related areas that are already catered for through the \u00a3310m in public and Lottery money invested through UK Sport.\n\nThe organisation has only broken even in the past two years through exceptional one-offs. Meanwhile, staff costs rose from \u00a32.2m in 2006 to \u00a34.2m in 2009.\n\nThe IOC confirmed that it had agreed to \"look at how a potential surplus from the Games would be defined and to offer both parties the opportunity to make their case\" and said its decision would be \"final and binding\" on both parties.\n\nThe BOA has indicated it will consider taking the case to the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne if the IOC does not reach a satisfactory decision. But Locog insiders believe a case could only be brought against the IOC itself and not the local organising committee.\n\nSenior figures in Olympic sport privately expressed fears that the row could undermine relations between the bodies that fund them in the run-up to the Games, although most remained confident their pre-Games preparations would not be affected.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/3/9/1299700104600/Lord-Sebastian-Coe-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ad5458dfc140dba5e6eb4892d15a1520", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport+politics%2CSport%2CLocog%2CBritish+Olympic+Association%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/3/9/1299700104600/Lord-Sebastian-Coe-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2f275496a736dde8dfdc8779c20be593", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/3/9/1299700104600/Lord-Sebastian-Coe-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ad5458dfc140dba5e6eb4892d15a1520", "date": "09/03/2011"}, "rank_206": {"title": "Social enterprise and the 2012 Olympic legacy for London", "text": "London's vision for the legacy of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games was always ambitious \u2013 regenerating neighbourhoods and providing opportunities for communities on a scale greater than anything envisioned or achieved by a previous host city. To achieve this vision for our Games, social enterprises must play a key role.\n\nI genuinely believe that the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games can only call itself a success if it leaves a positive and sustainable legacy across the whole country. That ambition, however, will only be fully realised if the UK's social enterprises, organisations that place at least as much emphasis on their social impact as they do on driving up profits, play their part.\n\nSocial Enterprise London is hosting a major conference on 15 March, 500 days before the start of the Games, to explore this theme.\n\nTake the example of Ealing & Hackney Community Transport Group (E&HCT), a social enterprise and one of the leading transport providers in the UK. They won the contract to provide coach transport within the Olympic Park, building on its outstanding reputation running red buses in London. E&HCT's profits are used to provide affordable community transport services to local voluntary organisations and disadvantaged people across the country, as well as to train and provide jobs for people who typically face major barriers to employment. It's revolutionary stuff, and it works.\n\nThe social enterprise movement and the Games have a lot in common. Both offer an optimistic vision of people working co-operatively, striving towards shared goals to achieve something that has the potential to change our world for the better. They also both show us the potential embedded within ourselves and our communities.\n\nIn recent times, having witnessed a dramatic decline in the world economy, we are looking to a more positive horizon. The Games offers an unequalled opportunity for the UK to set the trend for economic recovery and regeneration built upon the foundations of environmental sustainability and social innovation.\n\nA successful Games will be a stunning sporting and cultural event where the world puts aside its disagreements, if only for a moment, and dares to hope.\n\nIn that unique moment we want to showcase London's Games not only as an inspiring sporting spectacle, but crucially as the first to achieve the real, revolutionary regeneration of a deprived neighbourhood through training, jobs, new homes and new businesses.\n\nSocial enterprise will be a cornerstone of our Olympic and Paralympic Games story and the leaders of the regeneration in the long term are the social entrepreneurs emerging from local communities where the Games is already starting to bring about tangible transformation.\n\nThe London 2012 Games truly is a once in a lifetime opportunity to establish London as a world leader, not only on the cycling track and in the swimming pool, but in social enterprise as well \u2013 inspiring a new wave of social enterprises, and acting as a catalyst for successful ones to grow and flourish.\n\nAllison Ogden-Newton is chief executive of Social Enterprise London\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

It is understood that key participation targets bequeathed by the previous administration, towards which only negligible progress has been made, will be dropped.\n\nJeremy Hunt, the Olympics secretary, has also indicated a significant strategy shift for Sport England, the grassroots funding agency that will merge with elite funding body UK Sport after the Games. Both have had their funding protected through to 2015, thanks to a change in the way Lottery income will be distributed. But Hunt indicated that from 2013, Sport England would concentrate its strategy on school-leavers and young adults.\n\n\"I do think it's reasonable to ask whether, with resources as constrained as they are, if it's an appropriate use of taxpayers money to be focusing on adult participation when really what we want is to be getting young people into a habit for life,\" he said. \"We are looking very closely at whether we should target our resources more effectively in that respect. That would be a very significant shift that we're actively talking to them about.\"\n\nThrough the shift, it is hoped that older teenagers and those in their early twenties will get into the habit of playing sport and it will ultimately drive up adult participation figures in a more effective manner.\n\nA total of \u00a3480m is invested through governing bodies under the current Whole Sport Plan to 2013, but it remains to be seen whether that total is maintained in the next four-year cycle.\n\nShortly after London won the right to host the 2012 Olympics, Labour pledged to use the power of the Games to inspire a million more people to play sport three or more times a week. A second pledge, to be delivered through the Department of Health, promised to get a million more people doing more general physical activity, a broader definition that included decorating and gardening.\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian, Hunt confirmed the second target had been quietly dropped shortly after the coalition government came to power. The first target, towards which the sports have made only glacial progress, nominally remains in place for now but it is understood that it too will shortly be dropped in favour of a \"more meaningful\" national measure.\n\nIt is likely to be designed to keep up the pressure on governing bodies to improve participation figures ahead of 2012, while also preparing the ground for the shift in strategy after the Games.\n\n\"It's pretty hard to justify, in the current environment, Sport England funding office workers to try and encourage them to go to the gym more often. I'd rather encourage young people to get into sport for life,\" Hunt said.\n\nHe said some studies showed the number of children playing sport dropped by two-thirds when they left school. The new School Games should provide a framework for \"much closer links\" between schools and governing bodies, he said.\n\nFigures published last week by Sport England showed barely any progress was being made towards the target of 7.815m people playing sport three or more times a week by 2012-13.\n\nIts latest quarterly Active People survey showed the figure stood at 6.881m, only a marginal increase on the 2007/08 baseline of 6.815m.\n\nOver the four-year period football gets more than \u00a325m, tennis more than \u00a326m, cricket more than \u00a338m, badminton more than \u00a320m, rugby union more than \u00a331m and rugby league more than \u00a329m.\n\nSport England has been forced to warn sports that their funding could be cut if their participation figures don't improve. The government is believed to be keen to ensure that the shift in strategy doesn't let governing bodies off the hook.\n\nA total of 17 sports have seen a decrease in the number of people participating once a week since 2007/08, while just four (athletics, mountaineering, netball and table tennis) have recorded an increase.\n\nBasketball England this week became the first governing body to suffer a cut in funding. It was docked \u00a31.2m as Sport England attempts to get tough over the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, the sports minister Hugh Robertson will meet British Olympic Association chairman Lord Moynihan on Tuesday in a bid to find a solution to its ongoing contract dispute with the London Organising Committee over any potential surplus from the 2012 Games.\n\nThe embarrassing dispute, which the BOA is taking to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, comes as the International Olympic Committee's inspectors arrive in London to check on progress.\n\nThe BOA insists that the Olympics would yield a substantial surplus of up to \u00a3400m if all costs associated with the Paralympics were stripped out. But Locog believes the two events are part of an integrated whole and have budgeted to break even.\n\nThe government, who believe they have first call on the first \u00a363m of hypothetical surplus in any case, and the IOC back Locog's view.\n\nMoynihan will meet with Robertson, who has been trying to mediate between the two sides, ahead of a meeting of all the Olympic sports represented by the BOA.\n\n\"Good progress was made over the weekend and at our request the government has agreed a meeting to discuss an amicable resolution to the current contractual dispute,\" said Moynihan at a press conference to unveil a cast of British Olympic legends who will provide motivational, practical and fund raising support to Team GB.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CJeremy+Hunt%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport+England%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/3/28/1301347746712/Jeremy-Hunt-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c713d1aac1e1fe9863df89ae5291d6d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/3/28/1301347746712/Jeremy-Hunt-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f2ed9c44a607f841b40363016672c82f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/3/28/1301347746712/Jeremy-Hunt-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f2ed9c44a607f841b40363016672c82f", "date": "28/03/2011"}, "rank_154": {"title": "What will be the legacy of the London 2012 Olympics? | Owen Gibson", "text": "The elite legacy looks secure but it will take more than medals to reverse decades of under-investment in our sport infrastructure\n\nLondon was supposed to be the Games that would touch the parts other Olympics couldn't reach. Lord Coe's electrifying speech in Singapore that secured the Games set the tone \u2013 this would be an Olympics that would deliver not only a fantastic sporting spectacle but leave behind a legacy for east London, the UK and the world.\n\nIt vowed to inspire a generation through sport, regenerate the poorest part of the capital, get the entire country off their sofas and into the pool or the gym and leave behind a framework for elite sport that would ensure we never again plumbed the depths of Atlanta or Athens. World peace wasn't on the list but it might as well have been.\n\nAdded to that since have been all sorts of other legacy goals around shifting perceptions of disability, cultural aims and sustainability. Some have been well realised, others less so.\n\nSuch was the need to sell the \u00a39.3bn public investment to taxpayers that they were promised the moon on a stick. The dreaded \"L-word\" has become such a clich\u00e9 that organisers and ministers turn verbal somersaults to try and avoid using it. To this observer, the physical legacy rising out of the earth in Stratford can't help but impress \u2013 in bricks and mortar terms at least. Leaving aside for now the issues surrounding regeneration (ably outlined by Dave Hill here) the so-called sporting legacy can be broadly divided into what it means for elite sport, the venues and for mass participation.\n\nElite legacy\n\nDespite the impact of the funding cuts, the elite sporting legacy seems the most secure. There is a genuine determination to avoid the \"Sydney effect\" \u2013 where the Australians put huge sums into achieving at their own home Games but went backwards afterwards.\n\nThe government has protected funding through to 2015 (ie almost through to Rio) by changing the formula by which Lottery money is distributed. What will happen after that is anyone's guess. That is one of the myriad questions at the heart of the increasingly acrimonious legal battle between Lord Coe's Locog and Lord Moynihan's British Olympic Association over how any potential profit from the Games should be defined and divvied up.\n\nMoynihan's detractors, of whom there are many, argue his sugar-coated words about battling for a legacy for British sport (a nest egg of up to \u00a3320m he believes would be shared between the BOA and grassroots sport if he prevails) are merely a front for a long-standing, self-serving power-play to expand his organisation's remit and fill a financial hole.\n\nBut his supporters, including some of the Olympic sports, feel he is right to battle to secure as much hard cash as he can in the belief that government funding for elite sport is going to drop off a cliff at a time when the investment required to compete is only going to increase.\n\nVenues\n\nIn terms of the provision of the venues now nearing completion, the picture is mixed. The velodrome and the white water canoeing course at Broxbourne, planned and built with a defined legacy in mind due to the oversight of the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority, show what happens when it goes right. The aquatics centre \u2013 where design has trumped function and finding a legacy operator could prove a struggle - could yet show what happens when it goes wrong. And the jury is still out on the stadium. Clearly, the decision to discount a true \"dual use\" option a la the Stade de France in 2006 may yet come back to haunt organisers and planners if West Ham United's vision comes unstuck.\n\nYet it is hard to argue against the fact that London will be left considerably better off in term of world-class sporting venues after the Games than before it.\n\nParticipation\n\nThis is the element that has long proved most controversial. There is scant evidence that hosting an Olympic Games inspires the population to somehow, by osmosis, get fit or play more sport. It has not happened at any previous Games.\n\nBut emboldened by the legacy concept that won the Games, ministers promised in 2006 that not only would the Olympics spark an upturn in the nation's health afterwards but that by pouring \u00a3480m into sport through governing bodies, plus tens of millions more in so-called \"themed rounds\" directly through Sport England, they would make a big difference before the Games.\n\nOne million more people were to play sport three or more times a week by 2013, they declared, and a further million were to engage in more physical activity three or more times a week \u2013 a more elastic definition that included activities such as gardening and decorating.\n\nSport England, the body charged with delivering the first of those missions, has faced an uphill battle ever since.\n\nShortly after coming to power, the coalition government (very) quietly dropped the 1m due to be delivered through the department of health. Now, we understand, the 1m to be delivered through Sport England is to go too.\n\nThere is a persuasive argument that the target was the wrong one in the first place \u2013 persuading someone who already plays tennis twice a week to go jogging as well is nowhere near as valuable as getting someone who is inactive to do some sort of sport once a week.\n\nBut even by their own measure, progress has been dismally slow. Unfortunately for Sport England, and for Labour, they set the baseline not at the 2005-06 level (by which calculation they would have risen by a creditable 585,000) but the 2007-08 figure \u2013 by which measure the numbers have improved by a dismal 66,000.\n\nGoing by the figures, it appears ministers and Sport England have been wrong to put their faith \u2013 and \u00a3480m from taxpayers and Lottery hopefuls - in the hands of the governing bodies. Cajoling, bullying, persuading and threatening them appears to have made no difference.\n\nIn every sport, there are excuses. Team sports feel the Active People survey measure (30 minutes or more at least once a week) is unfair because it discriminates against those who take a whole day to play \u2013 cricket for example. Others feel that Sport England should measure actual sessions in actual leisure centres rather than relying on a (albeit comprehensive) survey.\n\nThe Football Association is aggrieved that the figures take into account all forms of the game when its historic focus has been on maintaining 11-a-side numbers.\n\nBut with some honourable exceptions, too many governing bodies (some because they are simply underpowered and understaffed) have proved themselves unequal to the task handed to them. The bounty was handed out, but too few governing bodies have the staff or structure in place to help them spend it wisely.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nSport England is starting to get tough by taking the money away, but it could be too little, too late.\n\nThere are plenty of good, committed, enthusiastic people working at the sharp end in British sport. But ministers need to realise it will take an awful lot more than the prospect of seeing Jessica Ennis winning gold to reverse the effects of decades of under-investment in our communal sporting infrastructure.\n\nMany of the intractable problems remain. Links between sports clubs and schools should be much better. New state-of-the-art facilities funded by the Football Foundation, for example, insist they are used almost continuously by schools and the community as a condition of funding.\n\nAnd all agree that not enough has been done to raise the profile of coaching as a profession, whether at community or elite level. On the continent or in the US, being a sports coach or even an administrator is a passport to respect and a decent salary. In the UK, it's all too often an under-rewarded and under-appreciated slog.\n\nThe FA has belatedly made much noise recently about the importance of age-specific coaches and the need to train them better and pay them more, but the same is true across sport.\n\nLabour are wrong when they criticise the coalition for scrapping their targets \u2013 given that they were probably the wrong targets introduced for the wrong reasons \u2013 but they're on safer ground when they hit out at the effect of local authority cuts on sporting facilities and schemes to fill to them.\n\nThe culture, media, sports and Olympics minister, Jeremy Hunt, told the Guardian this week that he believed that local authorities understood the power of sport and were committed to keeping facilities open. But when it comes to the crunch, councils are likely to see sport as the easy option to strike a red pen through.\n\nThings have improved since the depressing 1980s era of dilapidated leisure centres, draughty pools and disappearing playing fields. But a journey through France, Germany or the Netherlands still inspires envy at their municipal facilities and the fear is that the bad old days could easily return. That would be no Olympic legacy at all.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/3/31/1301567037462/Will-sporting-participati-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4870d97aadca0cc7d6a9edcb3451c736", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/3/31/1301567037462/Will-sporting-participati-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55a0d431c5c3dc99b9e95bfd534defc4"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/3/31/1301567037462/Will-sporting-participati-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=55a0d431c5c3dc99b9e95bfd534defc4", "date": "31/03/2011"}, "rank_245": {"title": "Guardian Focus Podcast: Why is the Olympic sporting legacy off track?", "text": "London won the 2012 Olympics with a promise to turn the UK into a sporting nation the world would envy.

The Lee Valley White Water Centre, located in the Hertfordshire countryside just north of the capital, will host canoeing and kayaking events next summer but will first open its doors to the public from Good Friday in what is being termed an oxymoronic pre-Games legacy.\n\nIf you can forgive the jargon, the centre itself and the thinking behind its immediate accessibility to the public is impressive. With the kind of white water rapids found at Thorpe Park and a caf\u00e9 serving frappucinos while you survey the action, it can hardly be instantly dismissed as a venue that will turn into a white elephant after 2012 .\n\nSurrounded by conservation areas and meadows dotted with cow parsley where even the hum of the nearby M25 is eclipsed by the sound of birdsong, in the intense April sunshine on Tuesday Lee Valley felt more like a holiday resort than anything to do with Olympic legacy statements.\n\nAs the water sparkled invitingly, sunglasses-clad Locog executives lounged on the type of furniture more likely to sit poolside at an Ibiza nightclub while, ironically, over in the real Ibiza the rain was pouring down. From their vantage point was a state of the art electronic ramp that lifts rafts and canoes from the pool of water at the finish line on the Olympic course back up to the pool at the start line \u2013 the inspiration for which came from Barcelona's 1992 Olympic white water facility and which completes the circuit of the course.\n\nDavid Florence, a British slalom canoeist who won silver at the Beijing Olympics, marvelled at the high-spec new facility. \"If I compare it to where I started out,\" he said grinning, \"well it was just a canal filled with shopping trolleys \u2013 it's a bit different here.\" The 28-year-old \u2013 one of Team GB's canoeists who has recently relocated from Nottingham to London to be closer to the centre \u2013 described what a boost it will give the sport as it will inevitably attract novices who may eventually turn out to be future Olympic stars. \"When I began I didn't think I'd end up being an Olympic athlete, I just did it because it was great fun. You can see how someone could develop here from just paddling around to really taking it seriously.\"\n\nThe \u00a330m centre boasts two different courses \u2013 the 300m Olympic competition course with a 5.5m descent for experienced and elite canoeists and kayakers and anyone who wants to have a go on a raft, as well as the Legacy Loop, a 160m course with a 1.6m descent designed to develop the next generation of canoeing and kayaking stars. There is also a flatwater pool for basic skills and safety training.\n\nFor the Olympic silver medal-winning canoeist Campbell Walsh the centre is already having a tangible effect on the performances of the GB team as they prepare for the world championships in Bratislava \u2013 Slovakia is a paddle-sport powerhouse nation \u2013 in September this year.\n\n\"I was in Bratislava last week \u2013 myself and David Florence went on a training camp \u2013 and while it's traditionally known as a very difficult big water course it felt comparatively easy compared to training here on a daily basis. If you can turn up at a course and find it easy that's really beneficial. It should hopefully improve us all skillswise, technically it will help our ability to paddle on this style of course which increases our chances of a better performance at the Olympic Games.\"\n\nBritain's elite athletes have been training here for the past few months, but the rest of the world's canoeists and kayakers will have a chance to come to Lee Valley this summer to get a feel for the course. Already the British camp are describing it as the hardest course in the world, one that will become even more challenging when the International Canoe Federation resets the direction of the rapids on the eve of the Games.\n\nIn the meantime the centre is proving popular with amateurs and has taken 3,000 bookings for whitewater rafting already \u2013 a half-day event open to 14-year-olds and upwards which includes a safety induction. The prices are steep at \u00a349 per person for rafting, or \u00a330 for a discounted Wednesday session (although canoeists and kayakers pay just \u00a310 for an hour or \u00a35 an hour on the basic course). Schools, however, will receive special pricing, with 36 schoolchildren from every London borough able to experience the rapids for free this summer.\n\n\"It's a great opportunity to actually come and experience an Olympic venue before 2012,\" said Shaun Dawson, the chief executive of Lee Valley. \"And it's something completely different \u2013 it's not a swimming pool or a running track which most people have tried at some point in their lives, but white water. It brings the sense of the Olympics much closer, you can actually feel and see and touch an Olympic venue 15 months out. It's legacy and it's now, not post Games.\"\n\nThe course has a circuit of walkways for spectators to follow the action but by 2012 temporary grandstands will be erected to accommodate 12,000 ticketholders who will have an overview of the entire event. During the Games the centre will be accessed by park-and-ride coaches or a short train journey from London to Cheshunt station followed by a 20-minute walk through the Lee Valley Regional Park \u2013 an area that runs from Docklands in London all the way up to Hertfordshire.\n\n\"This is a very tangible demonstration of the Games, you can come and see it, it's ready, it was on budget and it really works,\" said Paul Deighton, the chief executive of Locog. \"You can't argue with it. There's no room for grumbling because it manifestly is a great venue that will be wonderful during 2012 but will also have a long-term viable future.\"\n\nFor everyone who believes the Olympics are a waste of money, and who dismiss the term \"legacy\" as irritatingly ubiquitous propaganda, this venue \u2013 as something palpable here and now \u2013 seems to argue otherwise.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/01/20/Anna_Kessel,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0a4d2a67e0aa096de3728629c556e990", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/4/19/1303241844856/London-2012-canoe-venue-L-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=166d6aa9300e66cd8cfb069de73be373", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympics+2012%3A+canoeing%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/4/19/1303241844856/London-2012-canoe-venue-L-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82df9e32cc2821a0b92049b6bcef43b8"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2011/4/19/1303241844856/London-2012-canoe-venue-L-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=166d6aa9300e66cd8cfb069de73be373", "date": "19/04/2011"}, "rank_207": {"title": "Is the Olympics skills legacy on track?", "text": "I've been doing a bit of homework for a forthcoming Guardian podcast and found two things I'd like to share. First, the fun thing.\n\nThat was from last September. The Games Makers programme is now at the selection phase, with successful applicants being measured up for different roles. But what will it contribute to the long term regeneration of East London which is, of course, the ultimate objective of the great Olympics adventure? How about the complementary London Ambassadors scheme and the Personal Best initiative, which was designed to prepare the long-term unemployed for securing some of the Games's 70,000 volunteer roles and beyond that \"encourage 20,000 people into work\"? What about local peoples' hopes of securing the new jobs in the pipeline at Stratford City?\n\nThis brings me to the second thing. It's less fun than Eddie Izzard but still deserves your attention. In February, the London Assembly's economic development committee heard from guests who are closely involved with ensuring that East Londoners are equipped not only to take advantage of the employment and skills opportunities that the Games will provide, but also to use them to secure jobs and careers in the regeneration years to come.\n\nI've picked out a few quotes from the transcript of the meeting. First, a word of warning from Jonny Boux, the head of employment and training at the East London charity Community Links:\n\n[This] is a once in a lifetime opportunity for people in East London and I think there is a real danger that the focus, in terms of sustainability and longer term opportunity is lost...our experience tends to be, we are hearing a lot around the wonderful short-term opportunities...and the fact that people may find work for a month, but there are no guarantees beyond that.\n\nNext up, Kerry Tweed, Director of Greater London Volunteering on the Personal Best scheme:\n\nThe problem is that Personal Best is effectively finished now in London. I have not heard about any evaluation or any further work that might be possible to do with the around 4,000 people who have been through the programme to work with the training that they have been provided with to work with employers to see how that is transferable for them, to offer further support and training to move the participants closer towards work. The last stats that I had from Personal Best was that actually the biggest outcome for\u2423most people was they went on to further volunteering. Clearly, they need a bit more time to develop their skills, their confidence and their employability.\n\nCommittee chair Len Duvall asked about \"barriers that may prevent long-term unemployed Londoners taking advantage of the Games Time opportunity.\" Jonny Boux answered first:\n\nOne of the main barriers is a lack of skills, particularly around some things you need for particular jobs, and also life skills is an important factor. One of the things that, particularly, our long-term unemployed people face is often a difficulty around reliability and low confidence. There is often a lack of motivation as well; it is what we call, broadly, life skills. Then, I guess, multiple barriers which can be anything from major housing issues to difficult family circumstances and financial pressures. Many people we support are heavily in debt.\n\nThen, Lindsey Donoghue the Employment Manager of the Bromley-by-Bow Centre said:\n\nI would echo everything that Jonny said. Obviously some of the roles are quite short-term and that is an issue for some people in terms of them having been on benefits for quite a long time and feeling comfortable on those or perhaps feeling that coming off them might be a risk and feeling unwilling to do so for a short period of time. Also, doing roles like that they would need to arrange things like childcare; a lot of the people that we work with are parents. So, again, a short time role is difficult for them because they need to arrange childcare for that. Something that we have seen in our community is\u2423a\u2423sense of, \"Well, it's\u2423not really for me\". We have perhaps seen a limited number of people go into roles in the Olympics so far and because of that people sort of feel, \"Well, maybe it is happening separately to me or it is not something that is necessarily part of our community\".\n\nAnd here's quite a striking speech by Roger Taylor, Director of the Olympic Host Boroughs Unit.\n\nIf you asked anybody in the host boroughs what they felt about legacy, they would say that there is an ever-present danger that legacy becomes conflated exclusively with what happens during the Games and what happens on the comparatively limited, although very important, opportunities that will follow on on the Olympic Park. We feel it is terribly important to constantly remind somebody of what the bid promise was: the most enduring legacy of the Olympics will be the regeneration of an entire community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives there, and also to link that with the sheer scale of the opportunity that inner East London has within its grasp over the next 20 years.\n\nWe are not just talking about the Olympic Park, we are not just talking about Westfield and Stratford City, although we think that is actually a pretty successful model largely down to people like Newham and Westfield themselves. We are also talking about the already-given planning approval effectively to double the size of Canary Wharf, and the very, very significant developments that we still expect to take place in the Royal docks and on the Woolwich and Greenwich waterfronts. Essentially, if anything I think the Mayor's promise about 70,000 jobs is an understatement of what over the next 20 years is likely to be an opportunity in East London. The question then is whether or not we have got a sufficiently strong and clear vision to be able to ensure how that opportunity relates to the people in the communities in East London. I think that is where the really challenging questions lie.\n\nOn this evidence, I'd say that there's plenty of work still to be done if a really impressive skills and employment legacy is to be delivered for East London in particular. Something for the Mayor to get a good, firm grip on.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Unemployment%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSociety%2CLondon%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "05/05/2011"}, "rank_225": {"title": "Olympics 2012: London legacy 'sabotaged by spending cuts'", "text": "The mayor whose borough will host the 2012 Olympics has accused ministers of reneging on the government's promise to transform the deprived area in terms of jobs and training.\n\nSir Robin Wales, the leader of Newham council and a member of the Olympic legacy board, said hopes for transformation are being sabotaged by government spending cuts that will seriously restrict the ability of local leaders to deliver the promises made when London won the bid in Singapore six years ago.\n\nHis comments followed announcements by the Olympic Delivery Authority that 12,635 people were working on the Olympic park, a figure that met targets set by the London Development Agency. However, when the bid was won, officials promised the project would result in a 70,000 reduction in the number of workless people in the capital. After the Games, local councils will shoulder much of the burden for delivering this legacy.\n\n\"We know there needs to be reductions but not at this pace and not at this level of unfairness,\" said Wales, noting that all five Olympic boroughs in east London faced heavy budget restrictions. \"When Richmond is getting a \u00a36 a head cut and we are getting a \u00a3160 per head of the population cut, you can see where the cuts are falling. And we are the ones trying to do something to make a difference for our residents. This government just doesn't care. The dogma and the lack of any concern is staggering.\"\n\nSpeaking on a Guardian Focus podcast, Wales said the Games must not overshadow the drive to create employment opportunities. \"We stand here alone trying to keep that going. They are trying to make the Olympics work, but on the transformation of east London, they are walking away. It will happen, despite them, not because of them.\"\n\nDee Doocey, chair of the economic development committee of the London assembly, said the boroughs will need more direct help to keep promises made in the bid: \"This is not a five-year legacy. This is a 30-year project and unless someone is prepared to push for government funding to achieve the legacy, it will not be achieved because you can't do these things without money.\"\n\nOrganisers face the millstone of employment targets set at the time of the bid, when the economy was booming and there was the reasonable expectation that funds would be available to transform the east London economy. At that time, it was also thought likely that more opportunities would arise for the private sector.\n\nNeale Coleman, director of London 2012 at the Greater London Authority, said an employment and skills legacy is being achieved, exceeding that achieved by any other Olympics. \"An enormous amount has been done in this area, he said. \"We have seen a significant amount of new apprenticeships and if you compare this with other public sector projects it compares very favourably.\"\n\nA spokesman for the department for Business, Innovation and Skills said 426 apprentices had been employed at the Olympic park, which exceeded the initial target to train 350 apprentices. He said 98% of contracts awarded by the ODA had been won by British companies, half of which were based outside London.\n\n\"These contracts, worth \u00a36bn, have generated thousands of additional contracts through the supply chain and have come at an incredibly important time for the British economy,\" he said.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2010/9/30/1285856181846/The-London-Olympic-Park-i-005.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b4cea6ea9cc8c6f7bbb00d91a482ed75", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/6/1304704607972/Olympic-stadium-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4c408863db262183a70c77b28103e2d6", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/5/6/1304711688413/Yenew-Alamirew-Diamond-Le-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d0ce63b06378f97f74429eba2a6633a", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CLondon%2CLocal+government%2CLondon+politics%2CRegeneration%2CPublic+sector+cuts%2CPublic+services+policy%2CPublic+finance%2CCommunities%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/6/1304704607972/Olympic-stadium-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=883cb469b2956ed5e75a915818be0738", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/5/6/1304676141544/Anthony-Ogogo-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=795fc37004d9e94c42345c95a08d007c"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/5/6/1304704607972/Olympic-stadium-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4c408863db262183a70c77b28103e2d6", "date": "06/05/2011"}, "rank_213": {"title": "How green will the Olympics legacy be?", "text": "Large promises were made about our Olympics being \"sustainable,\" a word whose elastic definition encompasses a green future for the Olympic Park after the Games. What should that future look like? The foreign office video below, posted last November, has a distinctly promotional quality but it conveys something of the ambition and workings of the operation so far.\n\nThe London Assembly's environment committee has begun an investigation into the Olympic Park's environmental legacy, including progress towards the Olympic Board's declared objectives of conserving and enhancing the area's ecology, introducing improved management of waste, water and energy and minimising its carbon footprint. The sustainability pledge, to which both the UK government Boris Johnson have subscribed, is set out on page 11 of the boldly-entitled Towards One Planet 2012 sustainability plan and articulated in updated policy form on page 93.\n\nThe environment committee's chair Murad Qureshi AM wants to find out more about what will happen on the 45 hectares of green space already boldly written in to the park's maps of tomorrow and on additional stretches of open land. Will frogs breed and cherries blossom?\n\nHe's very interested in the contributions of the Games's six \"sustainability partners,\" BMW, BP, BT, Cisco, EDF Energy and GE as well as other commercial interests to making the park the promised \"blueprint for a sustainable future.\" And how will the Olympic Park Legacy Company, destined to become a more powerful mayoral development corporation, ensure this? The park's waterways are of particular interest. The River Lea which runs through the park is a major supplier of water to the capital and, as Qureshi points out, \"London could be heading for a drought this year and we're already facing problems with supply.\" Thames Water has long been looking beyond the capital for solutions.\n\nThese are big issues not only for East London but for the future of cities in general as urban populations continue to soar and devour resources accordingly. As for future Olympics, Qureshi, a big sports fan who attended the Athens, Sydney and Beijing games, has a firm and radical point of view: \"If you want the Games to show the way to long-term sustainability I think they have to settle on one permanent home. I know the IOC quite enjoys the dance round the maypole of different cities bidding, but if you settle on just one place you only have the transport aspects to consider in terms of sustainability because everything else stays much the same.

Sixty-three years later they are knocking it down. In this brazenly market-driven and self\u2011preserving phase of our history it could be that a vast national experience might revive the communal spirit that shaped society in the post-war years. For 17 days, at least.\n\nWhere do the British go now to feel a shared collective glow: Glastonbury? Or the TV screen to unite around a talent contest or The Apprentice? The 2012 Olympic and Paralympic hosts no longer coalesce around politics or religion but in pursuit of mass entertainment, which the Games have always claimed to be. The self\u2011declared \"Greatest Show on Earth\" offers an engulfing wave of pleasure and distraction as well as the perfect personal showcasing opportunity for David Beckham.\n\nWith the Olympic family now seeming as wholesome as The Waltons, compared to Fifa, London 2012 has been served a chance to strive for something higher than geopolitical ambition of the sort we endured in Beijing three years ago. A tall order, you may think, in a land where civil war erupts over the formation of a GB football team, but on all known precedent the British are exceptionally good at throwing themselves into international carnivals staged on these shores.\n\nLondon is staging next year's Games by accident. The shock bidding race victory over Paris landed politicians and organisers with the formidable task of inflating a toytown budget to a more honest level and actually piecing together an infrastructure capable of accommodating 26 sports across 34 venues, 10,500 athletes and double that number of accredited media. If we all paired off, each runner, swimmer and wrestler could have two personal journalists to record every grunt and grimace.\n\nWhen Paris acquired the lemon\u2011sucking countenance of the beaten red-hot favourite, supporters of London's bid formed two camps. One saw the Olympics as an opportunity to drive through the regeneration of London's East End and the Lower Lea Valley while reviving sport in state schools. The other, more hedonistic group, thought watching beach volleyball in Horse Guards Parade would be a giggle and confer on Britain some vague international glamour, yeah.\n\nIn the event the country finds itself constructing a sporting Disneyland at the time of draconian cuts to public spending. Many of us would rather have the Games of 1948 again with people cutting up old bed-sheets to make running shorts if it meant improvements to the NHS, schools and public services, but the universe we now inhabit is one of sob-inducingly high ticket prices and \u00a3400,000 Olympic logo design costs.\n\nThese will be my fifth Games as a reporter. A uniting theme is that Messianic pre-event sermons seldom result in long-term improvements for the population or their environment. Atlanta, in 1996, was the Games of corporate shock and awe, with Coca\u2011Cola the exclusive drink at all venues and bus drivers from Philadelphia who had never been to Georgia. But this was also the circus where Michael Johnson's 200 metres world record rampage of 19.32sec achieved the kind of instant televisual intensity that has become the emblem of modern sport.\n\nIndividual brilliance and drug busts: these are the two constants of Olympic competition. Atlanta was the Games where Ireland's Michelle Smith won three golds in the pool before being caught two years later trying to tamper with a urine sample to head off disgrace. Sydney 2000, where the fly-blown outback dunny was a theme of the opening ceremony, was the fortnight of Steve Redgrave's fifth rowing gold, Cathy Freeman's breakthrough for Aboriginal Australians and the cheating heart of Marion Jones, who was fuelled by tetrahydrogestrinone.\n\nAthens 2004 sent the media army scurrying after Konstantinos Kenteris and Ekaterini Thanou, who cited a motorcycle accident nobody saw for their failure to attend a dope test. Then came Kelly Holmes's victories in the 800m and 1500m and Paula Radcliffe's operatic collapse in the women's marathon. Four years later it was reported that 21 of the 22 facilities built for the Games were abandoned or derelict: a \"legacy\" the creaking Greek economy is in no position to correct.\n\nBeijing 2008 felt like an endless memo to the rest of the world, and America especially. This would be the Chinese century. The Games unfolded in secure compounds of spectacular architecture, high fences and choreographed gratification. Here we observed market capitalism coexist with authoritarian one-party rule and Michael Phelps weigh himself down with eight swimming golds while Usain Bolt extended the boundaries of human capabilities with his 100m-200m double.\n\nSo when the rhetoric is hacked away the abiding memories are of transcendent achievement, by Johnson, Redgrave, Phelps or Bolt. With its cult of \"togetherness\", the Olympics conceal their strongly individualistic origins. The happy-family spirit is a modern addition \u2013 and it works, often, by jerking the western mind out of its narrow obsession with fame and power. Away from our own funded culture, athletes are overcoming immense economic and cultural obstacles simply to be able to say they competed at the Games.\n\nThe Olympics' biggest single asset is that they are a convention of the whole sporting world, unlike the World Cup, where only the 32 best countries assemble. You never see hundreds of footballers flooding the host city once the tournament is over to rejoice and engage with the locals.

The aquatic centre looked great and a requisite \"splash\" was made across the media. Across the regions we are being asked to join in and reminded about the legacy the Games will leave all the UK \u2013 not just London.\n\nBut surely the biggest legacy for us, particularly for the regions, is the chance to show off and ensure more people choose to holiday across the UK. Are we \"ahead of schedule\" in making sure frontline leisure and tourism businesses deliver what our visitors will want and keep them coming back? Getting the infrastructure right is just part of it. With over 50% of an experience coming from people's emotional reactions, ensuring we deliver an experience and give people memories they will treasure and (most importantly) share is the key. Do we even know what a great British experience is \u2013 let alone if we are delivering a world-class one? Is the Olympic Delivery Authority even asking the question?\n\nAnne Blackburn\n\nCustomer experience director, Sidona Group, Sidmouth, Devon\n\n\u2022 I agree public leisure services should be made a statutory duty in England and Wales, as in Scotland (Report, 25 July). In the recession this will not provide extra money but will provide hard-pressed councillors with a basis to argue for fewer cuts and more crumbs in the fight over local government resources. These services will take a huge hit \u2013 my soundings suggest the cuts will be disproportionate at 25%-30% this year and not much less in 2012-13. This will countermand much of the effort by the same ministries to use London 2012 to promote active participation. Only local government can provide for those least able to help themselves. Many have their health affected by poor diets and lack of exercise, and sport can save the NHS great costs and get people active again. The commercial and voluntary sectors can ally themselves and help in such policies but cannot make up for cuts in the public core. So come on, Whitehall, get something simple into a bill in the next session!\n\nProfessor Mike Collins\n\nUniversity of Gloucestershire\n\n\u2022 Is there anyone living outside London not appalled by the parade of smug individuals (Seb, Tessa, Boris etc) telling us how great the Olympics will be for Britain? Was I the only one who imagined a velodrome or an aquatics centre, perhaps, might be built somewhere outside London? That was a fantasy, just like all the other claims about this ridiculous London-centric vanity project. How is it that much bigger countries share these big events across a number of far-flung cities, hundreds of miles from the capital? South Africa hosting last year's World Cup is a good example. I won't hold my breath for an answer though.\n\nRob Kail-Dyke\n\nBrent Knoll, Somerset\n\n\u2022 27 July, page 8: new \u00a3269m Olympic pool. Very nice too; a huge amount of money, but that's OK because the Olympics will boost participation in sport. Then contrast this with an item on the previous page headed \"Musicians stage protest to save pool in Leeds\". Swimming is one of the best, most egalitarian activities for all ages, sizes and fitness levels, but \u2013 unlike many activities \u2013 you can't just go outside and do it. You have to have a pool. There are few of them about and they are under threat from spending cuts. How many local pools could you run for \u00a3269m? How many new ones could you build?\n\nHilary Whelan\n\nFaversham, Kent\n\n\u2022 I totally agree with Lord Coe's statement regarding UK Anti-Doping's proposal that the use of recreational drugs by athletes should not carry an automatic ban (Report, Sport, 29 July). If it goes ahead it would only encourage the use of such substances by those who consider top athletes to be role models. We already see proven drug cheats on their return from a two-year ban being placed on pedestals and lauded by the media.

Seven years ago, these were showpieces of the world's greatest games when the Olympics returned to Athens. Today, they serve as reminders that the travelling circus tends to leave a tawdry legacy.\n\nFor nearly three decades there has not been an Olympic Games that could show a net profit, despite shrouding budgets in mystery. The last one to do so was Los Angeles in 1984 \u2013 and the cost of our looming extravaganza has ballooned from \u00a32.4bn to nearly \u00a310bn.\n\nCheerleaders for Britain's bid say our games will be different. So did their predecessors. Away from the hype and hoopla of London 2012, studies show major sporting events cost a fortune but fail to provide a genuine economic boost; they deter tourists and do next to nothing for the numbers of people playing sport. Even the \"feelgood factor\" is statistically insignificant, unless it is a major football competition.\n\nOne thing that can make a difference is the site itself, although even here most games end up losers in the long-run. Infrastructure is built to suit the demands of the International Olympic Committee, not the needs of the host city. Perhaps the one exception was Barcelona, where planning was part of a long-term strategy to return the city to the people after years of dictatorship.\n\nIt would be good to think our games will prove an exception. Instead, organisers are blowing their big chance. For there is a scheme that offers something special, the chance to create a unique, world-renowned centre of science and technology. Unfortunately, this innovative venture from one of Britain's most respected bodies is being sacrificed for a deal with a foreign potentate.\n\nThe Wellcome Trust, Britain's biggest charity, which uses a massive investment portfolio to fund scientific study, has made an audacious \u00a31bn bid to buy the Olympic Park. It wants to create a global hub for research and innovation, focused on health, technology and sports science. And given its track record, which includes pioneering research units, support for Nobel prize-winning scientists and the only AAA credit-rating in Britain outside of government, it should be listened to.\n\nThe trust has been in covert talks to bring in two universities \u2013 Loughborough and University College London \u2013 together with venture capital and technology giants. The plans, which include a museum, social housing and the creation of 7,000 jobs, envisage the melding of scientific study with the spirit of Silicon Valley. It would invest huge sums in cutting-edge facilities at a time when pharamaceutical companies are closing down research laboratories in Britain.\n\nYou might think such a proposal would be grabbed by organisers, with thanks that here is something with potential to transform east London and provide long-term benefits for Britain. But that would be too obvious. Instead, they are focusing on short-term profits by looking to sell the lucrative athletes' village to the Qatari royal family in conjunction with a private firm of property developers. Perhaps the jobsworths on the Olympic Park Legacy Company don't want to put themselves out of work by handing their entire site to one body. Or perhaps they are just stupendously shortsighted.\n\nEither way, hiving off the housing area means Wellcome will withdraw its offer, and Britain will lose a world-beating centre of life science. We are snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. What a terrible start for our Olympics.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2011/8/2/1312301088436/olympic-park-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=af86e2d85fb63d0284be6a0a01ae43a9", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+Stadium%2CScience%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2011/8/2/1312301088436/olympic-park-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5da2c445813ee85ad006c0218bbeede2", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Ian-Birrell,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b165d663f810f78395c83caafe4fb0f9"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/GUARDIAN/Pix/pictures/2011/8/2/1312301088436/olympic-park-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5da2c445813ee85ad006c0218bbeede2", "date": "02/08/2011"}, "rank_61": {"title": "London 2012 can legacy by verbing the noun | Harry Pearson", "text": "It has been all bubbling exuberance at the World Athletics Championships in Daegu. Records have been broken, races have been dedicated, dreams have been dreamed, starts have been falsed and nouns have been verbed. In the last case we should expect nothing less. Track and field leads the world in the important business of converting lumpy, dull old \"naming words\" into dynamic and vibrant \"doing words\" (a contrast with football, which has brought us nothing recently but the sullenly passive \"an assist\"). Vocab-wise, medalling and PB-ing are now totally part-and-parcelled, and most experts in South Korea believe podiumed, finalled and all-comered are not far off lexiconing.\n\nTraditionalists have naturally furore-ed over the new jargon, regarding it as the most serious sporting assault on the mother tongue since the retirement of Colin Murphy, the former Lincoln City manager whose Sincil Bank programme notes were the Finnegans Wake of football (\"You, me, we all of us,\" Murphy once wrote while in the grip of Imp-inspired frustration, \"have been forced to breakfast on travesty, lunch on objection and insult, dine on inflated pressure. High tea we don't sit still long enough to take and by supper we were still expected to be victorious.\")\n\nDespite the pedants' protests, many sports' elite performance directors feel even more needs to be done linguistically if Team GB is to potential in 2012. Some have even called on David Cameron to initiative as soon as possible to get noun-emissions three-quartered in the next six months. \"The London Olympics needs to legacy, not just physically but also verbally,\" the Locog chairman Lord Coed earlier this week at a party to celebrate the news that Stone, Island, Scallies have been named as the official corporate freebie ticket reallocation street corner redistribution specialists of the Games.\n\nWith record levels of obesity leading to fears that upwards of 63% of Britain may soon be trapped on the wrong side of doorways blocked by the remaining 37%, something clearly must be done. If Britain is broken, that can only be the result of one of our citizens sitting on it. A successful Team GB will help address that problem, for it is surely no coincidence that the fireworks that proclaimed the coming celebration of the announcement of the lead-in to the countdown to next summer's Olympiad inspired thousands of folk of all the many girths of multi-gutted Britain to crowbar the doors off the Arndale Centre and help themselves to running shoes and tracky bottoms.\n\nWhether a fresh, dynamic and moderned English language is the best way to ensure Team GB medal-tables above Australia, however, is being questioned by those who point to the increasing influence of lawyers in top-level sport. In Daegu this week the Chinese golded in the 110 metres hurdles not by running the fastest, but by pointing out that the man who finished first, Dayron Robles of Cuba, had spent a section of the race tugging on their athlete Liu Xiang's arm like a toddler trying to direct a parent's attention to a lofty display of Kinder eggs. That kind of attention to the letter of the law and quickfire finger pointing is very much part of the modern Olympics, say those who would like to see UK sport directing more of taxpayers' money towards the legal profession than to skinny kids who can jump over poles backwards.\n\nAs has so often been the case in the past, Britain more or less invented law as a sport, only to fall away once every one else took it up. Who, for instance, could forget that glorious time in Athens eight years ago when as Britain's hardworking Olympic legal beagles battled to get the German three-day eventers disqualified by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in order to earn the UK men and women a well-deserved equestrian gold? At the time it seemed this triumph would inspire a generation of British kids to get involved in the cool and spectacular world of pernickety objection-hurling, with none other than Clare Balding claiming that \"technical rule-chiselling is even more thrilling than mixed doubles badminton featuring Britain's dynamic duo of Robertson and Emms\".\n\nInspired, the prime minister, Tony Blair, promised to fund the building of hundreds more all-weather courts across country \"so that more and more ordinary people can get involved in this modern and innovative new game of complaining that the foreigners have cheated\". Alas, Mr Blair was soon distracted by the need to bring peace to the Middle East by blowing it up, and so that initial promise has withered to a point where Scottish football is unlikely even to wheedle a club through to the next round in European competition, despite Turkish clubs being turfed out over match fixing and the Swiss fielding illegal players.\n\nIt is a poor state of affairs, especially since disqualification blue-ribanded in South Korea this week. As Darren Campbell observed, \"Do you think the man in the pub would be talking about Bolt winning in, say, 9.80 seconds? No. But everyone's talking about this drama.\" The news that the men's 100m final in Daegu had saloon-barred will surely not have been lost on the IAAF.

Newham rejects that, pointing out that it will lend on commercial terms, against stadium income and Sir Robin Wales, mayor of the borough, one of London's poorest, argues the council will secure \"serious benefits for the community\" by being involved in the stadium.\n\nWhile the clubs tussle over that comparatively small slice of the deal, Simon Boyes, a senior lecturer at Nottingham Trent University specialising in sport and EU law, says it is arguable that the grant of the stadium to either club could itself constitute state aid: \"The transfer of state-owned property below commercial rates,\" he says, \"satisfies the European Union's definition of state aid. It might reasonably be regarded as conferring an unfair competitive advantage on the beneficiary football club.\"\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company, which has decided to hand the stadium to West Ham after the 2012 Games, and West Ham themselves, will argue it is not state aid, because West Ham will pay a \"market price\" for their lease, as EU law requires. Neither the OPLC nor West Ham's managing director, Karren Brady, would comment on what that market price is likely to be, as it is still being negotiated. However, West Ham's stance will be for a rent reflecting the club taking a stadium off the government's hands, because it had no other viable post-Olympics legacy.\n\nBrady will see as her model Manchester City, who pay nothing up to 32,000 seats for the \u00a3120m Eastlands stadium, built originally for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, then share ticket income with Manchester City Council on seats above that.\n\nWest Ham are likely to argue their deal should be more favourable, because the Manchester stadium was designed for football from the beginning, whereas the Stratford stadium was intended to be reduced post-games to a sunken, roofless bowl of 25,000 seats, with a running track. That stands as a reminder that the government, and Lord Coe, who led London's bid to host the 2012 Olympics promising they would transform opportunities for ordinary people to play sport, are where they did not want to be.\n\nWhen the Olympics were secured, the politicians were firm that they did not want their stadium to be handed over, as Manchester's was, for the ultimate enrichment of a Premier League football club and its owners. That was why the Olympic board, including Coe, approved the design of 55,000 temporary seats to come down to 25,000. However, the government realised gradually that such a stadium has no sustainable regular use, so the OPLC reached the conclusion, inescapable as soon as the games were even proposed, that the centrepiece, a hugely expensive stadium, has to go to a big football club.\n\nBrady confirmed this week that: \"West Ham are still committed, we believe it is the right legacy for the stadium, and we are prepared to take the risk because we believe on balance it will be positive.\"\n\nHowever, with the Spurs judicial review yet to be fought by the OPLC, she did not want to discuss the financial benefits the stadium move will deliver to her club. She and West Ham's 60% owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, (35% is still owned by Straumur, the Icelandic bank) did, though, make a fortune from their previous ownership of Birmingham City, the two Davids ultimately selling to the Carson Yeung\u2011led consortium for a combined \u00a355m. When they took over West Ham, paying \u00a330m each for their stakes, they talked immediately about wanting the move to the Olympic stadium, and earlier this year Sullivan told the BBC documentary Lord Sugar Tackles Football: \"We believe we will turn this club into a club worth \u00a3500m.\"\n\nIf they achieve that \u2013 fighting off the legal challenge, restoring the club to the Premier League and making a success of a stadium with a running track \u2013 Gold and Sullivan's 30% West Ham stakes would be worth \u00a3150m each \u2013 their fortunes greatly enhanced by taking over a brand new stadium built with public money for a fortnight of Olympics next year.\n\nThe future of the public's promised Olympic legacy, of, as Coe put it: \"The single biggest opportunity in our lifetime to transform sport and participation in sport in the UK forever,\" looks a great deal shakier now. After the International Olympic Committee opted for London, Coe himself became the \u00a3365,000-a-year chair of Locog, the body actually organising the games themselves, with little responsibility for the participation legacy. That role fell to Sport England, already the lottery grant\u2011giving body, but operating with less money because \u00a356m was diverted to bolster the budget for the Olympics themselves. That figure, \u00a39.3bn, to build the stadium, eight other new venues, the Olympic park and run the Games \u2013 protected, as is UK Sport's funding for elite athletes training to win medals \u2013 utterly dwarfs Sport England's budget to invest in all sports nationally: \u00a3249m this year, \u00a3232m in 2011\u201112, \u00a3271m the following year.\n\nThe government's \u00a31.6bn cuts to local authorities are expected to savage sport and leisure, still not services councils legally must provide. Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, who is credited with fighting for sport's share of lottery money, closed the previous government's free swimming funding weeks after taking office, saying it was \"a luxury we can no longer afford\".\n\nMichael Gove, the education minister, axed \u00a3164m funding for school sport partnerships, which promoted sport in schools; after an outcry then a partial U-turn, Gove's Department for Education now provides less than a fifth of that, \u00a333m, for a school sport programme, supplemented by \u00a320m from the Department of Health.\n\nA spokesman for Robertson's culture, media and sport department said: \"We are absolutely committed to using the Olympic Games as a catalyst to get more people playing sport. It is not an easy task but we are not shirking from that ambition.\"\n\nSimon Henig, leader of Durham County Council and sport spokesman on Labour's Local Government Group, said councils are trying not to cut services but as the cuts bite, it will become inevitable. His own council is having to close three of 19 leisure centres, and turn a further three over for more limited use, run by community groups, to cope with \u00a3120m cuts over three years.\n\n\"It is all very well spending \u00a39.3bn on the Olympics including building a \u00a3500m stadium which will go to a top football club,\" Henig said, \"but it is very difficult to increase participation in sport when there are swingeing cuts to sport and leisure provision, often in the poorest areas, where they are needed most.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/David-Conn,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b938091e640223126af0fe98e538ca2f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/9/6/1315334861591/David-Sullivan-pushes-Wes-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=58beb6e721845f36b13ab533d0cd98ec", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/9/6/1315334861591/David-Sullivan-pushes-Wes-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cb8375806dc7d9c39f547861d9242089", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Stadium%2CWest+Ham+United%2CKarren+Brady%2CFootball%2CSport%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/9/6/1315334861591/David-Sullivan-pushes-Wes-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cb8375806dc7d9c39f547861d9242089", "date": "06/09/2011"}, "rank_227": {"title": "Richard Caborn: 'Olympic legacy in danger of failing completely'", "text": "\u2022 Former sports minister says fall of participation is disastrous \u2022 Caborn wants strategy change to stop grassroots decline\n\nThe sports minister who helped to shape the legacy promises that won London the 2012 Olympics has claimed one of them \u2013 the drive to increase sports participation \u2013 has been \"disastrous\" and called for an urgent change of strategy.\n\nRichard Caborn, the sports minister when the bid was won in 2005 with a stirring speech from Lord Coe about the legacy it would leave for east London, sport and the youth of the world, said the participation drive was in danger of \"failing completely\".\n\n\"The Olympics will be a spectacular success but we are not capitalising on that. We are in danger of failing completely on the long-term sporting legacy of the Games,\" Caborn said.\n\n\"There needs a major change of direction in the strategy on this if the disastrous decline experienced by many of the sports is to be reversed.\"\n\nCaborn plans to elaborate on his warning in a keynote speech at the annual meeting of the Sports and Recreation Trust Association in Birmingham on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the many ambitious legacy promises attached to London's bid by the then Labour government was a vow to increase the number of people playing sport three times or more a week by one million by 2013. However, according to the latest quarterly figures from Sport England the total stands at 6.924 million, a modest increase on the 6.815m \"baseline\" figure in 2007\u201108 and a long way from the target of 7.815m by 2012\u201113.\n\nThe government has already dropped a second target that was to have been delivered through the National Health Service to get one million extra people taking more exercise every week.\n\nThe culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, indicated this year in an interview with the Guardian that the Sport England target was also likely to be dropped in favour of a \"more meaningful\" measure.\n\nCaborn partly blamed the system put in place by his successors in the Labour government, whereby \u00a3450m has been invested through the so-called \"Whole Sport Plan\" over four years and channeled through governing bodies.\n\n\"The key to this is Sport England changed the strategy in 2008 and has basically been just acting as a bank, funding governing bodies,\" said Caborn.\n\n\"They have failed on just about every count. They are responsible for the structure of grassroots participation and now need to change course and provide leadership.\"\n\nSport England rejected his claims, saying that less than half of its annual budget went to the governing bodies but admitted the pace of change needed to \"increase significantly\" over the next 12 months.\n\nCaborn's concerns echo those raised recently by the British Olympic Association chairman Lord Moynihan, another former sports minister. In July, he told the Guardian that the sports participation legacy was at risk and called for local authority funding of sporting facilities to be made mandatory.\n\nSport England has blamed the governing bodies and warned them that funding could be cut if their participation figures do not improve. Some, including both codes of rugby and basketball, have already seen their existing awards cut.\n\nOver the four-year period football gets more than \u00a325m, tennis more than \u00a326m, cricket more than \u00a338m, badminton more than \u00a320m, rugby union more than \u00a331m and rugby league more than \u00a329m.\n\nBut the latest Sport England figures from April 2011 show that 17 sports have recorded a decline in the number of people playing once a week since 2007\u201108 and only four \u2013 mountaineering, athletics, netball and table tennis \u2013 have recorded a statistically significant increase.\n\n\"The number of people playing sport is increasing, but the pace of change needs to increase significantly over the next 12 months and beyond,\" said the Sport England chairman, Richard Lewis.\n\n\"That is why the secretary of state for culture, media, sport and the Olympics has written to all sports governing bodies with the clear message that they must deliver participation growth or put their public funding at risk. Sports such as cycling and netball are already demonstrating what can be achieved through innovative approaches that focus on what people want from grassroots sport.\"\n\nA DCMS spokesperson said: \"Creating a sporting legacy from London 2012 is a key pillar of the Government's sporting strategy.\n\n\"A national School Games sporting competition, an investment of \u00a3135m in grassroots sport through Sport England's 'Places People Play', together with the very real prospect of significant British success in the Games next year, will create a springboard for a fitter, healthier and more confident nation in the years to come.\"\n\nSport England, which is to be merged with elite sport funding body UK Sport after the 2012 Games, is banking on the recent launch of mass participation schemes by the Football Association, the Rugby Football Union and the Lawn Tennis Association to make a difference.\n\nThe body distributes \u00a3242m a year in lottery and Treasury funding to grassroots sport, a figure that will increase to \u00a3283m next year as changes to Lottery distribution kick in.\n\n\"Our commitment to harnessing the power of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to boost grassroots sport goes beyond sports governing bodies, who receive about half of the money we invest,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"Through the Places People Play legacy programme, we are investing \u00a3135 million of lottery funding to transform sports facilities, create more opportunities to play sport and inspire more people to get involved in making sport happen at the local level. We are also investing in the School Games, which is giving young people across the country more opportunities to take part in competitive sport.\"\n\nThe government is believed to be in discussions about how the next round of Whole Sport Plan funding should work from 2013 and is planning an overhaul of the scheme.\n\nIt is understood that it will focus on specific targets around keeping young people in sport and be based on a much tougher \"payment by results\" mantra.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport+politics%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/9/20/1316532565038/richard-caborn-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2d109f84a0a46d9f9beb6f659416ceb8", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/9/20/1316532565038/richard-caborn-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a09f30b43cb09ef32dbc46b5b5888f55", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/9/20/1316532565038/richard-caborn-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2d109f84a0a46d9f9beb6f659416ceb8", "date": "20/09/2011"}, "rank_195": {"title": "Social enterprise and the London Olympic", "text": "\"Legacy\" is a word you hear more and more in sporting circles. How do we make sure that the country and community that hosts \u2013 and hence usually helps to pay for \u2013 a given sporting event derives as much lasting benefit as possible? With the start of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games now less than nine months away, the focus on their legacy is increasing.\n\nThere are already some big gains. The location of the London 2012 Games in an economically disadvantaged area of the city was the right decision. Out of these Games will come a reclaimed landscape that might have taken 30 years or more to clean up piecemeal. We will see a new economic centre emerge, a marvellous urban park and extensive commercial and residential amenities, all in a previously run-down part of the capital. It's easy to forget what the Olympic Park looked like 10 years ago, but the investment in infrastructure and transport, is in itself an immense legacy, a development platform for the future.\n\nThis regeneration programme has accelerated the development of east London by at least a generation. The way the Olympic boroughs co-operated and completely redesigned their planning processes to allow the Olympic Park to be created in a joined-up way is a good signal for London as a destination for business and investment. It makes the prospect of this area becoming a new economic focus for London more believable, more deliverable \u2013 as the recent opening of the new Westfield shopping centre shows. Local residents, meanwhile, stand to benefit from the healthier environment being created.\n\nThe announcement from Business in the Community (BITC) that it will provide support to hundreds of social enterprises in the host boroughs is another piece in the complex regeneration jigsaw. It is specifically about the contribution to economic and jobs growth that this can bring.\n\nThe Arc project is exciting because it is a first mover, providing practical, on-the-ground support for social enterprises in east London. The day after the Paralympic Games close, a huge plan swings into action to complete the business transformation, and this will take time to fully realise. But the project also has immediacy. Focused on social enterprise, it has triple benefits: it will support 1,000 new jobs, it will create new economic opportunity and it will cause successful enterprises to reinvest in the future of the community. It is accessible, practical, immediate help that intensifies the economic payback from the Games, as business opportunities continue to gain momentum in the years after 2012.\n\nDeloitte has backed London 2012 from the beginning, working with the bid team from its very early days and has since provided more than 400,000 hours of support to LOCOG. Alongside BP, another founding member of Arc, and other Games sponsors supporting this programme, we take seriously the responsibility we all have in ensuring a sustainable Games legacy for London and the UK.\n\nThe BITC programme was particularly appealing to Deloitte because it connects our role in delivering the London 2012 Games with our wider commitment to foster social innovation. We have already announced our backing for the Nexters scheme, which supports and develops social entrepreneurs, and Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus will be launching our full social innovation programme later this year. We want to help showcase social enterprises and social innovations that demonstrate real potential for growth and provide the support to help them achieve scale and become investment-ready.\n\nWe believe in the potential of this sector to become an important economic player. We want to be part of achieving that goal, share our experience with those emerging business leaders and learn from their innovation and creativity. Innovation is a big deal at Deloitte, it is a distinctive feature of our company, our services to clients and our people \u2013 and we want to be sure we recognise and support it.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges social enterprises face has been the difficulty of growing at speed and reaching a scale where they can make a difference on a larger scale. Business can play a vital role here, providing the advice and support to social enterprises as they grow.\n\nAnd this is a two-way exchange. Our people will learn new skills by working in this emerging sector, senior executives from other clients will have the chance to get involved and we will all improve our understanding of one of the fastest growing sectors in the country.\n\nNext summer, the UK will revel in the excitement and glamour that is the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The 29 days of events spread over six weeks will be a fantastic spectacle, but the impact and value of the Games will be felt for a much longer period across a broad and hugely worthwhile set of areas. Social enterprise, and specifically the Arc programme, can play a significant role in delivering this legacy.\n\nDavid Sproul is senior partner and chief executive of Deloitte For more information on Deloitte's Social Innovation programme, clike here\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Earlier this year he wrote to all governing bodies to warn them that they had to deliver.\n\nThe sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said: \"These sports bodies have delivered on our key objective of driving up participation. The \u00a33.5m of additional funding for these sports is so that they can continue this work, capitalise on the added interest that comes with hosting the Olympic Games and help create a real sporting legacy.\"\n\nThe additional money largely comes from cash withdrawn from other governing bodies deemed not to be hitting the targets they have been set. Basketball, rugby union and rugby league are among the sports that have had their funding cut.\n\nBritish Cycling received an additional \u00a31.058m with the aim of recruiting a further 12,000 weekly cyclists by expanding its Sky Ride local scheme. \"I am delighted that British Cycling has been granted additional funding to develop its participation programmes,\" said the Olympic team pursuit champion Ed Clancy. \"London 2012 is not only about athletes contesting Olympic and Paralympic medals, it is also about getting the nation active and leaving a lasting sport legacy for future generations.\"\n\nEngland Netball, long held up by Sport England as a positive example for the way it has encouraged lapsed players to return to the sport, also received over \u00a31m to achieve an increase of 8,500 extra players a week.\n\nAnother \u00a31m will go to England Athletics to recruit 30,000 regular informal runners a week. The move will be seen as an attempt to boost numbers among the most popular sports ahead of the 2013 target date. Smaller awards will go to lacrosse and canoeing. The canoeist Tim Brabants, who won gold at the Beijing Games in 2008, said: \"This additional investment demonstrates the confidence and health of canoeing in this country. The funding will help us continue to grow the sport and get more people enjoying canoeing on a regular basis, with the many positive benefits that brings.\n\n\"Go Canoeing is an exciting project; the tours, trails and series of events, delivered in a consumer-focused way, will broaden the appeal of canoeing to a wider market.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/SPORT/Pix/pictures/2011/10/4/1317725227194/Netball-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=81b6ccdee005387a2273f0c74c1b6c60", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/SPORT/Pix/pictures/2011/10/4/1317725227194/Netball-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=84c4c01bdbd4f1f064f901c9d7bc3fbb", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport+politics%2CCycling%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2CNetball%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/SPORT/Pix/pictures/2011/10/4/1317725227194/Netball-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=81b6ccdee005387a2273f0c74c1b6c60", "date": "04/10/2011"}, "rank_53": {"title": "Lord Coe: Olympic stadium will not be white elephant after London 2012", "text": "\u2022 Collapse of West Ham deal forced Coe to reject claims \u2022 'It was the right decision to cut through ongoing legal challenge'\n\nThe London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, has been forced to reject claims that the Olympic stadium will become a white elephant after the Games, after a deal with West Ham United collapsed.\n\nIt was Coe who made the promise to the International Olympic Committee in 2005 that the stadium would have an athletics legacy and he has campaigned passionately for the track to be retained.\n\nBut following the collapse of a deal with West Ham and Newham council for the east London club to move in following the Games amid prolonged legal challenges, there have been renewed concerns over the viability of the stadium with an athletics track.\n\n\"It was the right decision to cut through the potential for ongoing legal challenge here and, worse than that, ongoing legal challenge that was taxpayer-fuelled,\" said Coe, appearing before the London Assembly.\n\n\"It is very important that we maintain a commitment to an Olympic legacy and to a mix of tenancies in there.\"\n\nAssembly member John Briggs put it to Coe that there was \"a high risk\" of the stadium becoming a white elephant if there was not a fundamental rethink of the options.\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company and the government have signalled their determination to hold a quick-fire tender process to find a football club prepared to move in on a tenancy basis, with the stadium remaining in public ownership.\n\nThe most likely outcome is that the taxpayer will have to foot the bill to convert the 80,000-seat stadium into a 60,000 venue suitable for both football and athletics, with West Ham paying an annual rent and UK Athletics entitled to 21 days use per year.\n\nHowever, Coe was challenged over whether the stadium would ever be full for athletics meetings. Those fears will deepen if UK Athletics fails in a bid to host the 2017 world championships in London on 11 November.\n\nCoe said that the stadium would be filled for \"every session\" of the world championships if London is chosen by the International Association of Athletics Federations, but also pointed to the success of domestic meetings. He said the Olympic Stadium would be full for Diamond League meetings, currently held back-to-back over two nights at Crystal Palace.\n\n\"If we had a larger venue we would fill that venue. You only have to go to Crystal Palace for any of those Diamond League meetings to know how many people turn up on spec hoping to get tickets,\" he said.\n\n\"London is the only city that stages two of those back-to-back. We not only sell out for every one of those meetings but would also probably be able to sell five times that number of tickets. There is no lack of demand for top-class track and field in this country but clearly sitting alongside the use of the stadium for local events, English schools championships and the plethora of events and other competitions.\"\n\nCoe said he had been right to campaign for the retention of track and field within a mixed use stadium. \"Let's not run away with the idea track and field is a sport that is not supported. It's a popular sport with an extensive network of clubs in this country and is central to broader policy aims of public health. I am a doughty defender of my sport and I think it is the right mix.\"\n\nAlso appearing before the Assembly, the London organising committee chief executive Paul Deighton admitted that its existing budget of \u00a3262m for security within venues \u2013 the only element provided for by public funds \u2013 would not be enough. He said that money would have to be found from contingency funds within the overall public funding package of \u00a39.3bn to pay for extra guards around perimeter fences and within the venues.\n\nLocog is finalising with the Metropolitan police and the Home Office what the final number should be. The original estimate of 10,000 is likely to end up well below the final total, with the use of the armed forces and the territorial army one option under consideration to bridge the gap.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/19/1319055676338/Sebastian-Coe-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d2e72fd3d114aec229b6c57b90dc2f48", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Stadium%2CSebastian+Coe%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/19/1319055676338/Sebastian-Coe-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5771fc5b6139b6e895030fc7d3b91eb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/19/1319055676338/Sebastian-Coe-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d2e72fd3d114aec229b6c57b90dc2f48", "date": "19/10/2011"}, "rank_60": {"title": "London's Olympic legacy must fulfil the promises made | Dave Hill", "text": "The creation of the London 2012 Olympic Park has, so far, been a model of precision budgeting and solid time-keeping. No, you are not dreaming. The top brass of the Olympic Delivery Authority, the body responsible for getting the east London site ready for the Games, has confirmed to the London Assembly that it expects to use up only \u00a37.2bn from the \u00a38.1bn it had to do the job.\n\nThe landscape and various buildings this, admittedly still prodigious, quantity of cash has been splashed on \u2013 the main stadium, the athletes' village, that exotic aquatics centre and more \u2013 have long since sprouted from the soil, standing as palpable, architectural rebukes to Olympics doubters everywhere. All seems to be going swimmingly. We must now curl our lips and ask if it can last.\n\nI'm not referring to next summer's festival of sport but the sunlit vista of urban regeneration that we've been promised lies five, 10 and 20 years beyond it. The argument marshalled to justify the giant sums spent on the park is that the Games will be but the golden dawn of an era of social and economic renewal in the capital's poorest compass points. But dark clouds can be seen on the horizon. They do not fill the sky and may yet be wafted away, but they are there and full of rain.\n\nThe most prominent hangs over the future of the stadium. The recent decision to dump the deal that would have seen West Ham United become its owners in partnership with Newham council has been dignified by the government and London mayor Boris Johnson as ending, in the latter's words, the \"faffing around\" caused by an array of legal challenges.\n\nAlas, a faffing comeback is already underway. The plan now is not to sell the stadium at all but instead to seek a steady tenant. Barry Hearn, the chairman of little Leyton Orient, whose club aspires to moving in, has demanded that Johnson be excluded from the letting decision because he's said he thinks the Hammers will get the keys.\n\nMeanwhile the Olympic bid promise to retain an athletics track for posterity has been strengthened. This further entrenches the bedrock problem with the stadium. That problem is that it needs to draw regular football crowds to have a hope of being commercially viable, yet football and athletics tracks make a poor mix because the latter means that fans of the former must sit further from the action on the pitch.\n\nWest Ham remains ready to take the risk. Orient supporters have raised a 4,000-name petition asking Johnson to reconsider his apparent endorsement of the bigger club. Whichever prevails, major surgery will be required on the \u00a3600m bowl to make it fit for a multipurpose future. Who will pay? Unless and until all these issues are resolved the stadium's legacy, both financially and as a place of bustling activity, remains uncertain. Cynics say it is destined to turn white, grow a trunk and gorge from the public purse for years.\n\nA javelin throw from the stadium are the Olympic press and broadcast centres, assembled on the banks of the River Lea. Shadows of uncertainty surround these facilities, too. The Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC), which will handle the park's transition from a Games setting to a whole new metropolitan district, has tried mightily but failed to get the BBC to shift its EastEnders operation into part of the gaping spaces that will be left after the world's sports hacks have gone away. They've now taken those spaces to market and will appraise their options in seven weeks' time. The aim is to found a thriving creative industries hub, complementing the informal arts quarter across the waterway. This was never going to be easy. Failure will be quite a calamity.\n\nThen there are the 8,000 new homes the park is planned to eventually contain. Five neighbourhoods have been mapped out and named by the public in advance. Complex planning applications have been submitted. The first dwellings in the forthcoming Chobham Manor should be complete in 2014, but who will end up living there? In line with the demands of mayor's new London Plan, 35% of the homes must be affordable.\n\nWhat, though, does \"affordable\" really mean? In London, where accommodation costs are daily more insane, the coming squeeze on housing and other benefits combined with the advent of the government's ill-named \"affordable rent\" product in preference to subsidising cheaper \"social rents\" raise the prospect of the next generation of \"affordable\" homes being beyond the financial reach of increasing numbers of London households whose housing needs are great.\n\nPlace-making, to use the jargon, is a complicated art, yet there is widespread confidence that the leadership of the OPLC has mastered it as well as anyone. Operators will be assigned to other sports venues in the park \u2013 the aquatics and handball centres \u2013 early next year to make them ready for public use. Much thought has been devoted to filling the park's open spaces with events and attractions when it reopens following the Games. But a half-dead stadium, a half-empty media hub and rows of new homes that ordinary Londoners can't afford would undermine the legacy landscape. These things must not come to pass.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/10/20/1319130043277/Olympics-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2a2f8063516d73d22349b14f1ffb4c90", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CBoris+Johnson%2CPolitics%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CRegeneration%2CHousing%2CSociety%2CCommunities%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/10/20/1319130043277/Olympics-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0aa07ceb2b6306d4b4dd92ce70d26010"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/10/20/1319130043277/Olympics-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0aa07ceb2b6306d4b4dd92ce70d26010", "date": "21/10/2011"}, "rank_54": {"title": "Olympic Park: long office block and upmarket shed for rent", "text": "Artist's impression of post-Olympics broadcast and press centres\n\nAs I surveyed the third floor of the Olympic Park press centre I was seized by a profound insight. This room is very long, I thought. Very long indeed. I calculated that Usain Bolt in full flight would get from one end to the other in just under 15 seconds, which gives you a clue about the distance we're discussing. He'd cover the width in roughly five, assuming he didn't collide with a lift shaft.\n\nIt was, in short, a cavernous, sterile space, naked but for stacks of shrink-wrapped carpet tiles awaiting the arrival of a fitter. While the games are taking place, this floor and four others will be rammed with written word sports journalists. And when the games are over? Who knows?\n\nMy visit to the press centre was, rather suitably, part of a media tour organised by the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC), whose job it is to ensure that the park's 500 East London acres and the structures they contain do not go to waste after the gongs have been awarded and the athletes have gone home. A prominent part of that task is the creation of a commercial district in the north-west corner of the park on the banks of the River Lea navigation canal.\n\nThe plan is for the press centre, with its 300,000 square feet of floor, to become office space where cutting edge tech and creative industries flourish and multiply. The neighbouring - and twice the size - broadcast centre, from which billions of hours of TV and radio output will emerge for three weeks next summer, must also be filled with tenants of the same, preferred kind.\n\nThe OPLC's website stresses the proposed district's proximity to the art galleries of Hackney Wick across the waterway, and notes eagerly that the neighbourhood was tipped by Vogue to \"become the centre of the cultural universe.\" Projections of the post-games era depict a buzzing hub of happening innovation and sophisticated lifestyle consumption, complete with hair salons and cafes.\n\nI think you're getting the idea, and I can certainly vouch for the great view of London the upper levels of the press centre offers, from the Victorian Gainsborough primary school in the foreground to a glimpse of the mighty Shard far beyond. But translating vision into reality is not going to be straightforward, as a more realistic, parallel OPLC narrative has long acknowledged.\n\nThis pair of hulking piles - an office block and \"an upmarket shed\" as one candid member of the tour party described them - were erected with Olympic requirements in mind, not legacy ones. The OPLC and Hackney Council, which has invested great job-creation hopes and energies in the project, tried mightily to get the BBC to relocate the EastEnders operation to the broadcast centre, where it would have filled getting on for half the space. They failed despite the park being awarded the E20 postcode of the soap's fictitious Walford setting.\n\nThat let-down bravely absorbed, the OPLC formally invited bids from potential tenants five weeks ago and is at pains to emphasise its own flexibility and that of the caverns it is seeking to populate. The worlds of games development, fashion, and movie post-production are all urged to look and inquire. Large anchor tenants are welcome to sub-let, multiple occupation would be just fine, the generation of \"growth and move on space\" for new companies would be marvellous too. True, it takes 23 minutes to walk to the planned hub from Stratford station, but a bus shuttle service will cut that travel ordeal down to eight.\n\n\"It's really very open,\" chief executive Andrew Altman said. \"The space can be used in many ways.\" Apparently the broadcast centre can be \"reconfigured into four separate buildings,\" if that seems like a good idea. Extra windows can be installed in it as well. The closing date for offers is 2 December. Preferred bidders will, with luck, be announced next June. The two buildings should be re-fitted for companies to function in by spring 2013. A commercial district knee-deep in tumbleweed does not bear thinking about. Cutting-edge creative types in all their, ah, vibrant diversity, can \"take a look around\" right here.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/8/1320750268281/Press-and-Broadcast-Centres-CGI-with-indicative-text_website-news.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14e8548ea1648bbdaa6ad6c5a773baa1", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "08/11/2011"}, "rank_201": {"title": "Olympic legacy at stake in London's bid for 2017 World Championships | Owen Gibson", "text": "The verdict on whether London or Doha hosts the 2017 World Championships will have ramifications for British athletics, the bidding team and the future of the Olympic stadium\n\nWhen Jodie Williams, the great hope of British sprinting, joins forces with the UK Athletics delegation in Monaco bidding to bring the World Athletics Championships to London, there will be more at stake than simply making it third time lucky in securing the event.\n\nAmid the high hopes and dashed dreams of a principality long associated with desperate spins of the roulette wheel, Lord Coe will join the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, the UK Athletics chairman, Ed Warner, and the chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, Baroness Ford, in an attempt to beat Doha to the prize on Friday.\n\nFor the politicians and sports administrators, the decision of 27 members of the International Association of Athletics Federations Council will have a large bearing on how the unfolding chaos surrounding the future of the \u00a3496m Olympic stadium plays out. Win, and the case to retain the athletics track in a 60,000-seat stadium in Stratford is bolstered. Lose, and the rationale for maintaining a track in a stadium of that size starts to break down.\n\n\"I think the case for a mixed use community stadium in Stratford is an absolute commitment we've given and that case remains as strong as it can be, regardless of what happens on Friday. But I do want these world athletics championships very, very badly indeed,\" said Robertson, without specifying big that stadium may utlimately be in the event that London loses.There are also high-stakes personal considerations. As ever, the decision will be made partly on the merits of the two bids but against the backdrop of a host of other political and financial calculations.\n\nCoe, the London 2012 chairman and IAAF vice-president who vowed to leave a strong athletics legacy in the Singapore speech that helped secure the 2012 Games, is widely suspected to have ambitions to succeed Lamine Diack as president of the IAAF in 2015. But he is jostling for position with Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian former pole vaulter who is also an IAAF vice president, which could split the European vote.\n\nCoe insisted that internal IAAF politics would not be a factor: \"My council will make a balanced judgment on Friday and those judgments will be based on the merits of the two cities and the sport going forward.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson and Robertson are still bearing the scars of their ill-starred involvement in the 2018 World Cup campaign, on which \u00a321m was spent in securing a single non-English vote. Johnson, with a re-election campaign looming, and Robertson, having pledged to underwrite the bid, are also desperate to deliver a meaningful manifestation of the Olympic legacy. Having already missed out on hosting the world hockey championships and the football World Cup, the only events currently inked in for the period once hubristically dubbed the \"golden decade\" were won under a Labour administration.\n\nTheir determination was in evidence whe IAAF inspectors arrived in London last month. Robertson skipped the Tory Party conference to host them, while David Cameron left behind the keys to Number 10 for him to host a reception there. \"I do still feel a bit bruised about 2018 but I also recognise athletics is a different sport to football. Personally, I know the electorate here much better than the Fifa delegates and that does give me confidence in the integrity of the process,\" Robertson told the Guardian.\n\nFor Doha, the stakes are also high. The oil-rich middle eastern state of Qatar has targeted international sport as the means by which to promote itself to the world and undertake infrastructure improvement projects of mind-boggling scale. The 2017 World Athletics Championships are seen as the ideal staging post towards its hugely ambitious aim of securing the 2020 Olympics, two years before it will host a World Cup secured in controversial circumstances.\n\nHaving persuaded the IAAF to accept its bid on the basis of moving the championships to September, victory would provide further ammunition in its campaign to win over IOC members sceptical about the prospect of doing the same for the Games.\n\nIn some senses, it is a replay of the choice faced by a series of international sports bodies in recent years.\n\nDoha is offering to take the sport into new territories, pledging substantial financial support for a not hugely cash rich sport in the interim and promising innovative solutions to deal with the oppressive heat, which could top 100F even in September.\n\nLondon, on the other hand, will argue that after Daegu, Moscow and Beijing by 2017 a return to western Europe will be overdue and cautions that long-term relationships with sponsors and fans could be damaged if not. Coe and Warner will promise full stadiums for all sessions, claim the support of athletes and sell the potential commercial benefits of London. Qatar can offer deep pockets and the prospect of untapped new horizons.\n\nDoha, for example, has already promised to underwrite the IAAF's entire \u00a35m prize fund for the 2017 championships. London cannot compete except to argue, as Warner has, that the sum is modest compared to the potential overall commercial boost for the sport in coming to London.\n\nCoe is also planning to borrow a couple of pages from his London 2012 playbook in emphasising the potential benefits to the future of the sport in inspiring young talent. \"We are a world capital for young people and we are a global media hotspot. Those two combinations are very important. It is driving that message through to the next generation and encouraging them to choose a life in track and field,\" he said.\n\nWarner and Coe are convinced they have neutralised the ongoing uncertainty over the fate of the Olympic Stadium, despite the high-profile collapse of a deal with West Ham and Newham Council last month under the weight of legal challenges from Tottenham, Leyton Orient and amid rancorous accusations of spying and subterfuge.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, they will be accompanied by Ford, deployed to reiterate the commitment to the track remaining in the stadium no matter what. But it is perhaps telling that the OPLC is delaying its re-tender of the Olympic Stadium tenancy until early next month, when the outcome of the bid will be known. It admits going back to the original \"base case\" - a 25,000 seat, stripped down athletics stadium with no roof - remains an option. In what those involved will hope is not an echo of the blighted 2018 World Cup campaign, Diack is under investigation by the International Olympic Committee over claims that he accepted bribes from the defunct sports marketing firm ISL.\n\nDiack denies the claims, made in a BBC Panorama documentary broadcast last December, but the IOC executive committee will hear the results of an investigation by its ethics committee in December. The IAAF president is considered crucial to London's chances, as he is expected to sway the votes of others. Warner insisted Diack's view would not be coloured by the allegations.\n\n\"One of the things I've realised in recent weeks is that there is a huge industry of people who make it their job to see conspiracies behind every door, to get you to worry about what the opposition is doing and what people might be thinking,\" he said. \"I have taken a policy decision that we'll put our front foot forwards, go through the front door and engage in a dialogue with people about the merits of our bid. Every indication has been that this whole process has been fair, open, honest, straightforward and will be decided on its merits on Friday.\"\n\nRobertson and Coe, who went to Monaco last week in an advance party to meet with Diack, will try to persuade the Senegalese that he must deliver on his side of the bargain over the retention of the track. At the height of the battle between Spurs and West Ham over the Olympic Stadium, Diack was pressed into action to claim London's 2012 bid would amount to nothing more than a \"big lie\" and a \"betrayal\" if Spurs' plan to demolish the track won the day. Having now promised to keep it, there is a belief that Diack has something of a moral obligation to deliver.\n\nFor London's critics, there is evidence of the arrogance charge that always tends to be flung at domestic bids for major sporting events. In 2005, London successfully diffused that perception; in 2010, the World Cup bid did not. Critics say that Warner talking of Europe being the \"breadbasket\" of the sport and London's commercial offering being \"head and shoulders\" above Doha's may reinforce that perception.\n\nCoe sought to strike a different note: \"You have to be the right city at the right time. You have to chime with the environment...We're not bidding with an air of entitlement, this is about service.\" Warner also insisted that, rather than the failed bids for 2005 and 2015 being seen as a black mark, London would be given credit for staying power. A previous bid to host the 2005 world athletics championships ended in ignimony and embarrassment after plans to build a new stadium at Pickett's Lock were abandoned, while a bid for 2015 also had to be shelved because the wording of the tender document for the stadium left some ambiguity over whether the track would remain, leading Spurs to propose that it be removed.\n\nThere is now talk around the hotel lobbies of Monaco of an elegant solution that would see one city awarded the 2017 championships while the other hosts the 2019 edition. But Warner said unequivocally that London was only interested in 2017 because the \"stars were aligned\" for that date and government funding guarantees would not stretch to 2019, a stance Robertson confirmed.\n\nA representative of the Doha bid also said on Wednesday that it was not interested in 2019 either, because it would not fit in with its wider plans. Coe said he believed the single vote would go ahead as planned and would go to the wire. \"Out of a group of 27 people, you have to assume there are a few that are yet to make their mind up.

New to Sport England, new to sport, with everyone beginning to talk about how to create a legacy from London 2012, it made sense to find out how other host cities had approached it. So on a sunny, cold autumn day, I found myself walking around the Olympic Park in Athens.\n\nIt was completely empty, behind high, padlocked gates. The swimming pools were literally crumbling. And no one was playing any more sport. Our hosts were charming and disarmingly frank. Before their Games in 2004 there had been only two priorities: finishing the venues in time, and improving the city. It's true that they no longer have power cuts every summer in Athens. But legacy as we would understand it \u2013 especially sporting legacy \u2013 was simply neither a plan nor an issue.\n\nSo the very fact that we have been working on \u2013 and investing in \u2013 legacy since we won the bid puts us light years ahead of recent host cities. The result is that we have an Olympic Park that will regenerate east London and become a centre for both elite and participation sport, and a sport sector that is more focused than it ever has been on growing participation.\n\nI think every Olympic and Paralympic sport recognises that London 2012 offers them a huge opportunity to boost their profile and participation in their sport. But it's just that \u2013 an opportunity.\n\nWhen the interest is created, and thousands of young people think \"I'd like to do that\", sports need to be ready to respond. Governing bodies like hockey and equestrianism already have excellent plans in place to convert that moment of inspiration into a great first encounter with their sport and a long-term commitment to participate, but more need to follow their lead.\n\nThe focus on a mass participation legacy \u2013 and the expectations we've set in return for public funding \u2013 have helped sport move towards a better business model; one where the consumer is at the centre and the sporting offering reflects what people really want.\n\nI don't pretend this journey has been plain sailing. We've had to issue wake-up calls \u2013 and in some cases reduce funding \u2013 to some national governing bodies that weren't delivering at the pace we need to see. But there's no doubt that our sector is maturing. Look at netball or cycling and you'll see sports that really listen to what their customers want \u2013 and recognise that satisfied customers are the ones that will stick with sport.\n\nWe're seeing more innovation too; the Ping project has taken table tennis tables, bats and balls onto the streets of England, helping to drive a surge in the number of players.\n\nPeople also want to play their sport in a decent environment. Just as a restaurant with tatty decor will struggle to prosper, so we need to invest in high-quality sports facilities. Through our Places People Play legacy programme, we're putting over \u00a390m into facilities and playing fields. Just last week 350 local projects learned that they've been successful in their bid for around \u00a317m of that investment. Swimming pools with leaking roofs, cricket clubs without decent practice nets, sports halls without decent changing rooms \u2013 all will be fixed with lottery grants as a direct result of the Games coming to London in 2012.\n\nWe still have a long way to go and some big challenges to overcome, as the participation figures we issued earlier this month show. I'm particularly concerned that we're not yet doing enough to tackle the gender gap in sport, with only 28% of women playing sport once a week, compared with 40% of men. It's critical that our sector does more to make sport relevant and appealing to women.\n\nSport also needs to adapt to the economic situation. More of those people doing less sport are telling us it's because they can't afford it or no longer have time as a result of working longer hours. So sports need to work on low-cost and flexible options that fit in with people's lifestyles.\n\nDespite some progress among the rest of the adult population, participation among those aged between 16 and 19 is heading in the wrong direction. Too many young people are dropping out of sport when they leave school, further education or university. We've been working with ministers since the summer on a new strategy that will tackle this issue head-on by taking community sport to the doorstep of young people and helping them to discover what sport has to offer.\n\nSo none of us underestimate the difficulties \u2013 but nor should we overlook the extraordinary power of the Games. On the brink of 2012, we need to celebrate the fact the Olympics and Paralympics will offer us the opportunity to connect with a new generation and tempt older generations to give sport a second chance. Now we just need to grasp it.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/30/1325261702856/east-end-celebrate-olympi-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3b461c942c9911f852ae3e745c19fad0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/30/1325261702856/east-end-celebrate-olympi-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3dbb3c7697b5c33f1e633fe5f61cd0db", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CSport+politics%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/12/30/1325261702856/east-end-celebrate-olympi-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3b461c942c9911f852ae3e745c19fad0", "date": "31/12/2011"}, "rank_129": {"title": "School sports cuts threaten the Olympic legacy, says Tessa Jowell", "text": "The 2012 London Olympics will go down in history as a giant \"missed opportunity\" for young Britons unless David Cameron orders an urgent rethink to revive and boost sport in schools, former Labour Olympics minister Tessa Jowell says.\n\nThe stark warning from Jowell, a member of the Olympics board and one of the leading champions of the Games, lays bare mounting concern at sport's highest levels that the Olympics will be scarred by a failure to deliver on the promise of a permanent legacy.\n\nHer comments, in an interview with the Observer, will embarrass Cameron ahead of a special Olympics cabinet meeting this week to fine-tune planning for the \u00a39bn Games, which are now just some 200 days away.\n\nJowell, who helped frame the successful 2005 UK bid around a promise to \"inspire a generation\", has been central to the cross-party consensus behind the planning of the Games.\n\nHowever, she felt she had to speak out to try to reverse the coalition's \"incomprehensible\" decision to \"dismantle\" the very national programmes for school sport that had been on course to deliver the legacy. Jowell said the decision in 2010 of the education secretary, Michael Gove, to withdraw funding for the programme of schools sports partnerships had \"undone eight years of work at a stroke\".\n\nThe need to build a legacy through school sport was a \"classic example\", Jowell argued, of where cross-party cooperation had been necessary \u2013 but had broken down after the coalition came to power. Jowell said: \"The fact is that kids were beginning to build sport into their everyday lives, using sport as a motivator to get them to school on time, to feel proud of being at school where they could discover abilities that they never thought they had.\"\n\nThere was evidence that sport in primary schools had gone into decline with the Olympics approaching, though statistics were difficult to compile because Gove had abolished the survey that monitors sporting activity.\n\nShe said the prime minister \"needs to understand that a great national opportunity is slipping away every week \u2013 and it can, just, be rescued in time for the Games. The failure to continue the progress toward unprecedented levels of participation in sport for children of all ages in state schools risks being one of the great missed opportunities of the 2012 Olympics.\"\n\nShe called on Cameron to order a complete rethink of policy and re-instate or replace the previous national network of local sporting partnerships, which provided specialist teachers to schools, as a matter of urgency.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2010, secondary school children playing two hours or more of sport a week rose from 20% to 85% as the partnerships were built.\n\nCameron now faces pressure from several directions to act to avoid having the Olympics marred by his government's approach to school sport. Last week Baroness Campbell, who heads the Youth Sport Trust and heads UK Sport, the funding agency for elite Olympic sport, called for a long-term agreement to be reached on funding for school sport. if there was to be any chance of delivering a real legacy from the Games.\n\n\"My plea is that if you want a legacy, you need to think long-term strategy,\" Campbell said. \"There was a legacy from the last strategy, which was greater participation [in schools]. If you really want to make the School Games a driver you've got to think long term.\"\n\nJowell said: \"The decision to bid to host the Games was a decision to do something very big and ambitious for young people's lives. So it is simply not good enough for ministers to wring their hands about childhood obesity, low self-esteem, absenteeism and bad discipline, when there is so much evidence to show the extent to which sport can remedy so many ills.\"\n\nMinisters are putting in place a new national competition, the School Games, that will climax with finals at the Olympic Park in the summer. They say the Games will be the basis for a policy for competitive sport, although funding is not guaranteed beyond 2014-2015. So far only around half of all schools have signed up to take part.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/1/9/1326141618925/Handout-photo-of-the-Lond-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b5b63c951117c1e44632fa091885fb03", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=School+sports%2CTessa+Jowell%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CPolitics%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CMichael+Gove%2CUK+news%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/1/4/1325688578867/Baroness-Sue-Campbell-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=308666a5121fabdfa4314ba2c63228c2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/1/7/1325958220844/Olympic-park-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=722803cf91a29bc54abba98a0c646525", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/2/7/1328633130472/Pupils-in-a-PE-class-at-L-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8627c145648278676f8d8d43b65d5f9a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/12/7/1291713680208/school-sports-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56a76137f3fe6ac88ea53c0d292d7762", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/1/7/1325958220844/Olympic-park-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=255b639262e53fc04f06175dd6146a6a"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/1/7/1325958220844/Olympic-park-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=255b639262e53fc04f06175dd6146a6a", "date": "07/01/2012"}, "rank_239": {"title": "London Olympic press and media centre legacy shortlist revealed", "text": "An \"innovation city\", a UK \"fashion hub\" and a sports-based offering in partnership with Loughborough University have been shortlisted to move into the cavernous media and press centres on the Olympic Park after the Games.\n\nThe vast buildings have long been considered among the biggest legacy challenges for the Olympic Park Legacy Company but the chief executive, Andrew Altman, said it had generated \"huge amounts of commercial interest\".\n\nPrime minister David Cameron has said he wants the tenants to be part of his vision of a \"tech city\" stretching from Shoreditch and Old Street to the Stratford Park.\n\nAn earlier plan for the BBC to move the studios where it films EastEnders to the Park collapsed amid concerns about its suitability from producers. A plan to turn the media centre into a giant indoor snowdome has not made the shortlist.\n\nThe broadcast centre and press centre will house 30,000 journalists during the Games.

With 12 months on the countdown clock, Boris Johnson played his traditional Paris-baiting role in the newly unveiled aquatics centre and David Cameron invited the world to the capital from Trafalgar Square. Accompanied, incongruously, by Princess Anne and The Feeling.\n\nBut with six months to go and the organising committee kicking for home, or whatever other sporting metaphor you choose to employ, things have got serious. The cavorting one-eyed mascots \u2013 sinister to adults, oddly appealing to kids \u2013 have been pushed to one side; the east London schoolchildren in matching T-shirts given the day off.\n\nInstead, the world's media will be walked painstakingly through plans for the next six months, from the final batch of ticket sales to the torch relay and all the way to the opening ceremony on 27 July.\n\nThe years spent poring over spreadsheets and models are about to be put to the test under the glare of a world media not necessarily predisposed to London after the cheerful kicking doled out to previous Games by our press.\n\nUntil recently, progress appeared remarkably smooth. The organising committee had reached Olympic year without the mass resignations, sackings, government splits and huge cost overruns that have defined previous Games. The venues were built, sponsors brought onboard despite the economic crisis and tickets all but sold out.\n\nBut the pressure of imminent delivery has caused cracks in the facade. While ticketing has been a triumph in terms of revenue, it has dented public confidence as technology failed and disappointed punters complained of unfair treatment. The scramble for the final batch of 1.3m sales in April will be a stern test.\n\nLocog's reputation for painstaking attention to detail took a dent when security numbers inside venues more than doubled from 10,000 to 23,700 \u2013 requiring a call on the military and pushing the \u00a39.3bn budget to the limit.\n\nThen there is the ongoing drip, drip of negative publicity over Dow Chemical's sponsorship of the wrap that surrounds the stadium, fuelled by campaigners who believe it has yet to fully answer for its links to the 1984 Bhopal disaster.\n\nIt is a wholly unnecessary row, especially given that many believe the stadium looks better without the wrap, and taps into the worst fears of some about the relationship between the Games and big business.\n\nFor all that, organisers could not hope to be in much better shape ahead of the home straight. The three biggest imponderables remain the same as when the bid was won: London's crowded transport system, security and the British weather. There will be plenty of doom laden prognoses issued for each but organisers believe they have done all they can.\n\nTransport for London chiefs are relying on entreaties to commuters and ticket holders alike to consider alternative routes and change their travel plans. Security costs and numbers have soared, but organisers insist it won't affect the atmosphere. And, short of investing in cloud seeding technology like the Chinese, the weather remains in the lap of the gods.\n\nThe stage is ready \u2013 now Locog needs to put on the show and build the public mood. At one end of the scale are the professional cynics and \"Gloomadon poppers\" (as Johnson has christened them). At the other, the evangelical cheerleaders \u2013 led by Coe and the politicians who have staked their reputations on its success, who insist it will result in huge legacy benefits for UK plc and the health of the nation.\n\nMost of the public remain somewhere in the middle \u2013 excited by the sporting spectacle and an excuse to party but unsettled about aspects of the International Olympic Committee juggernaut about to hit London.\n\nAs the focus switches, probably sometime around the torch's arrival in May, from logistics to the scale of the sporting spectacle, the lesson of previous Games is that cheerleaders will start to drown out cynics. Most importantly, the cohort of Team GB athletes who will have the biggest impact on the mood of the nation appear in fine shape following a period of unprecedented public investment. Organisers hope for an early \"moment\" \u2013 perhaps a gold for cyclist Mark Cavendish on the first weekend \u2013 to catalyse support.Ministers and organisers are banking on a repeat of the wave of giddiness that gripped the country during the royal wedding to trump the pervading gloom of a dark economic cloud they had at one point hoped might be about to lift by the time of the Games.\n\nThe mixed bag of expansive legacy promises that went a long way to securing the Games for London and justifying its price tag will fade into the background the closer the Games get \u2013 only to return more loudly afterwards. In the meantime, a viable future must be found for the main stadium if it is to avoid the dreaded white elephant tag.\n\nIn truth, we won't really know just how gaga the British public will go for these Games until Danny Boyle unveils his Underworld-soundtracked opening ceremony. In the meantime, there's just 82 days until the 100-days-to-go milestone.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/1/26/1327597114858/Londoners-celebrate-as-th-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa1a73673e7d0af55130cad027cc5b25", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/1/26/1327597114858/Londoners-celebrate-as-th-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=483b305d571e47122a1a5d3d75ec0aed", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CLondon%2CSport%2CUK+news%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/1/26/1327597114858/Londoners-celebrate-as-th-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa1a73673e7d0af55130cad027cc5b25", "date": "27/01/2012"}, "rank_241": {"title": "The Olympic legacy will be a festival of the people | Dennis Hone and Andrew Altman", "text": "Anna Minton asserts that the Olympic Park will be \"entirely private, sold off piecemeal to the highest bidder\" (A festival of private Britain, 25 January).

In the tradition of London's great estates such as Grosvenor and Cadogan, the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) plans a long-term approach to the regeneration of the park and its surrounding areas, maximising returns to the taxpayer, and economic and social opportunities for local people.\n\nYour leading article (London 2012: Keeping the Olympic spirit, 30 January) lists three \"universal truths\" about the Olympics. It could have added a fourth: that when critics see the Olympic reality minds will be changed.\n\nWe know most people have not yet been able to visit the park. What they will see this summer is an extraordinary transformation by the Olympic Delivery Authority of a run-down area, delivered on time, to a tight timetable, and producing savings of over \u00a3900m against the budget set in 2007.\n\nThey will see for themselves a range of new sports facilities intended for public use \u2013 the Olympic Stadium; an architecturally stunning Aquatics Centre providing 50-metre pools that London badly needs; an indoor sports arena; and a velodrome that will gain extra facilities after the Games \u2013 as well as riverside parkland that will become a place to visit in its own right.\n\nThe Olympic Village, used by athletes during the Games and providing housing afterwards, has been sold \u2013 so reimbursing some of the considerable public spending. Half the 2,818 mainly rental apartments are designed to be affordable, with half of these allocated by councils. There will be a new school for 1,800 students and a medical centre.\n\nFar from ducking our local jobs duty as Minton claims, more than 46,000 people have worked on the park - 18% resident in the host boroughs, exceeding the targets of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). We have worked with councils on job brokerage services for local residents, giving them priority access to new jobs, and training, both in basic and construction-industry specific skills.\n\nLike the legacies left by the Festival of Britain and the Great Exhibition, the Olympic and Paralympic Games are a once-in-a-lifetime chance, a catalyst to create a new piece of London bringing benefits for generations to come. It stands comparison with both those great projects.\n\n\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Stadium%2CLondon%2CHousing%2CJob+hunting%2CSociety%2CSport%2CUK+news%2COlympic+legacy%2CCommunities%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/6/1328550832558/Olympic-Park-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e82ded6cadb2a93830f9bf340d9a657d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/6/1328550832558/Olympic-Park-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3bb0e4646aff0d1e90e28c42d05632e", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/6/1328550832558/Olympic-Park-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e82ded6cadb2a93830f9bf340d9a657d", "date": "06/02/2012"}, "rank_198": {"title": "Olympic legacy head Baroness Ford to step down after London 2012 Games", "text": "Baroness Ford, in charge of securing the economic future of London's Olympic Park, has announced she will step down after the 2012 Games.\n\nThe chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company said: \"The next phase of the legacy work, including major transformation plans to the park, are critical and will require a great deal of attention.

Some may lack the facilities. Or the coaches and role models to teach them. Others, in an age of 24-hour entertainment and instant fame, may simply lack the desire. We are determined a London Games will address that challenge. So London's vision is to reach young people around the world. To connect them with the inspirational power of the Games. So they are inspired to choose sport.\"\n\nAs Guardian education editor Jeevan Vasagar writes today, there are now very real fears that Coe's electrifying words will result in little meaningful change. The background is complex and controversial, marked by political and ideological rows and turf wars.\n\nIn 2010 the education secretary, Michael Gove, resolved to remove the \u00a3162m ringfenced funding for a network of school sports partnerships that had raised the number of schoolchildren engaged in two hours or more of sport per week from 25% in 2002 to more than 90% by 2010.\n\nFollowing a feisty debate in the Commons (during which the shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, suggested the cuts were Gove's revenge for years of misery on the playing fields) and a furious rearguard action from teachers, pupils and athletes, some of the money was reinstated. But it was less a U-turn and more a 90-degree turn.\n\nSue Campbell, the redoubtable chair of the Youth Sport Trust, and her new chief executive, John Steele, are putting a brave face on the new strategy. Campbell says it can be the start of a renaissance for competitive school sport.\n\nBut while a total of \u00a3153m will be going into the School Games over the next four years \u2013 gathered from a variety of sources and including \u00a310m of sponsorship from Sainsbury's \u2013 it doesn't make up for what has been lost.\n\nMeanwhile, behind the scenes, there was also a pitched battle for control of the School Games themselves. Lord Moynihan, the British Olympic Association chairman, thought that its remit after the Games could usefully extend to running a school Olympics. But Hunt said on Monday that the BOA wanted complete control, which wasn't on the table. So the name was changed to the School Games and the BOA sidelined.\n\nHunt also lauded the fact that half of all schools had signed up. By the same token, that means that half of schools haven't \u2013 in London the total is only 42%.\n\nThe risk is that we will be left with a patchwork of provision between those schools that understand the wider value of sport and those that don't \u2013 exactly what the original strategy was introduced to combat. There is no such hesitation at private schools which pour their considerable funds into top-class sporting facilities and as a result have punched well above their weight at recent Games, supplying half of all Britain's medallists.\n\nHunt deserves praise for doing what he can with limited resources to try to minimise the effect of the cuts imposed by Gove and he loyally defends the actions of his colleague.\n\nBut it is hard to see how sacking 450 people, then re-employing the majority of them on fewer hours with a re-badged job title and simultaneously cutting the primary school provision that could instil the very \"sport for life\" attitude that Hunt's rhetoric promises can be seen as a step forward.\n\nFor all the economic gloom, and the inevitable cuts, the London Games should have been a moment to definitively rebalance Britain's relationship with sport and exercise \u2013 beginning in schools, and particularly in primary schools.\n\nMinisters from all departments are keen to pay lip service to sport's role as a social tool \u2013 inspiring otherwise hard to reach children, raising academic achievement and self-esteem. But not enough of them are willing to find the means. This is difficult stuff and the societal and cultural barriers are immense. But that does not mean the original aim \u2013 to use the Olympics to catalyse a lasting change in sports policy and the amount we invest in it \u2013 was wrong.\n\nFor all the money poured into school sport by the last Labour government when times were good, they arguably didn't do enough to hardwire investment in sport and exercise into bigger Whitehall departments such as health, education and the Home Office.\n\nNow the money they did provide is leaking away. Nor does there seem much clarity on how progress will be measured \u2013 Hunt talks vaguely of instilling the habit of \"sport for life\" and measuring progress at 16, 18 and 21. Which means it will be years before we know if the strategy works.\n\nThere are other pressing concerns. Cuts to local authority budgets will inevitably impact on facilities, and the effects are just starting to be felt. Meanwhile, planning laws are being changed in a way that has raised fears about the impact on playing fields.\n\nHunt spoke at a briefing this week of wanting to follow the example of continental Europe and create community sports clubs of the kind that will be familiar to anyone who has spent time in the Netherlands, Germany or France. That is a laudable aim, but is hard to see how the mishmash of policies and initiatives \u2013 individually impressive as some of them are \u2013 that has been cobbled together to assuage concerns over the Olympic legacy can achieve it. Hunt's enthusiasm seems genuine, but it is hard to avoid the suspicion that the government as a whole increasingly views the Games as a month-long morale-boosting advert for Britain rather than a driver of lasting change.\n\nCoe, loyally, insists that the coalition is delivering on his promises by reinvigorating competitive sport. But others are less sure \u2013 from opposite sides of the political divide both Tessa Jowell and Moynihan have expressed confidence in the regeneration vision for east London and Team GB's medal hopes but flagged up school sport as an area of grave concern.\n\nThe danger is that after the Games, Britain's attitude to sport will remain broadly unchanged \u2013 world-class at watching it, and sometimes at practising it at the elite end, but with a population largely happy to take part from the comfort of their sofa with a big bowl of crisps.\n\nStadium wrap leaves a little to be designed\n\nLondon 2012 organisers are close to unveiling the design for the contentious wrap that will surround the stadium at Games-time, but Damien Hirst and other big-name British artists who were initially approached will not be involved.\n\nThe \u00a37m wrap that will surround the main stadium during the Games is at the centre of protests from MPs and human rights groups over the fact it is being paid for by Dow, the chemicals giant which they claim still has outstanding liabilities relating to the 1984 Bhopal disaster in India.\n\nInitial plans for the 1km wrap were scrapped during the government's comprehensive spending review as the \u00a39.3bn Olympics project shared some of the pain of widespread spending cuts, but revived when a commercial sponsor was found.\n\nHowever, the original designs for the wrap were abandoned and a push to find a new designer was launched. Hirst and other British artists were approached but it is understood that talks went no further than preliminary conversations.\n\nBarry Gardiner, the Labour MP who has called for a parliamentary review of the decision to back Dow, told the Guardian that any prominent British artists would be damaged by their association with the wrap.\n\n\"I can't imagine the artistic community of the UK feeling that Dow Chemical, with all its history, is a sponsor they particularly want to associate themselves with. I would be gobsmacked if any eminent British artist decided that what they wanted to do was associate themselves with the Bhopal tragedy.\"\n\nSir Humphrey doesn't take the train\n\nHarassed civil servants across Whitehall were this week expected to \"reroute and remode\" their journeys to work in order to practise for Games-time. The transport secretary, Justine Greening, has already promised that her department will achieve a decrease of 50% in normal traffic by working from home and travelling at different times. Games organisers are relying on an average reduction of 30% among London commuters to avoid transport chaos. Posters pinned up around the DCMS building urged staff to partake in the week-long rehearsal. And Ian Watmore, the former FA chief executive who is now leading a Whitehall cost-cutting drive, tweeted: \"This week we are practising for the Olympics by working out of London or on flexible shifts. Today I'm heading to Norwich from Manchester.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/SPORT/Pix/pictures/2012/2/8/1328697658982/Jeannie-Longo-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=649fdf38a59d6f1ba8d0fb05723b18f9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Players/Player_Photos/2012/2/7/1328630157425/David-Howman-in-Lausanne-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c1c9fceabb4668667cf643464854fab", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/2/7/1328657295201/London-Olympics-School-Sp-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=63afc6420d89a6e081ec09b314332d92", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/8/1328704993238/Alberto-Contador-Cadel-Ev-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d31610ea447154f1dc1bb16af4fa57b", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CEducation%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/2/7/1328657295201/London-Olympics-School-Sp-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=162266f02f7ad7771d9e247293715db0", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/2/7/1328657295201/London-Olympics-School-Sp-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=162266f02f7ad7771d9e247293715db0", "date": "08/02/2012"}, "rank_39": {"title": "Universities' Olympic legacy will be one of collaboration", "text": "The future of higher education at the Olympic site in London will centre on the need for institutions to work together not compete\n\nBy the time the last athlete breasts the line at this summer's Olympics, another set of competitors will already be at the starting blocks. These are the businesses and organisations keen to take over parts of the site at Stratford, east London, and their focus is on intellectual rather than sporting muscle.\n\nAll three of the bids shortlisted for a chance to occupy the Olympic press and broadcast centres involve a higher or further education element \u2013 from a fashion college, to a link-up between a French sports retailer and Loughborough University, to research and technology centres.\n\nUniversity College London (UCL) is also developing plans for a new campus east of the Olympic Park, with possible research and teaching space and accommodation for staff and students.\n\n\"The scale of the site we are looking at \u2013 over 20 acres \u2013 in central London terms is incredible,\" says Andrew Grainger, UCL's director of estates. \"And the fact that it will be adjacent to the Olympic Park is a significant attraction. The government has invested hugely in the area, and the Olympic Park will be fabulous.\"\n\nThere have nevertheless been mutterings, online and person-to-person, among some UCL staff about the wisdom of opening a campus away from its main Bloomsbury site in central London. \"Having everything concentrated close together has a whole number of advantages, such as encouraging communication between people in different disciplines,\" says Simon Renton, the University and College Union's (UCU) vice-president, higher education, and a UCL history lecturer.\n\n\"Geography means students and staff are more in touch with each other, so in that respect moves away from Bloomsbury are generally not something people are very keen on.\"\n\nBut Grainger says that while the project is still in its early stages, with no decision expected until June on whether or not it will happen, good transport links and the opportunity to be part of the Olympic legacy and to \"bookend\" the growing technology corridor in east London, stretching from Shoreditch to Stratford, were too good to ignore. Operating on multiple sites is hardly new in higher education \u2013 at one stage De Montfort University had campuses in four different towns, and three different locations in Leicester alone \u2013 and the trend has been growing, particularly through moves to open campuses overseas.\n\nFigures just released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that the number of students studying in overseas branch campuses rose from just over 11,400 in 2009-10 to just over 12,300 in 2010-11. At the same time, universities based in the UK regions are expressing increasing interest in setting up campuses in the capital. Coventry, Glasgow Caledonian, East Anglia, Bangor and Northumbria already have bases in London, while others, including Newcastle and Loughborough, are considering the possibility.\n\nMalcolm Gillies, chair of London Higher, which represents higher education in the capital, says: \"London has a more vibrant demographic than many other parts of Britain, so it is not unusual that people would look to come there \u2013 particularly if they have a good-quality educational product \u2013 to secure student numbers.\" He suggests that east London is a particular draw because it is the biggest area of population growth.\n\nBut he warns there are downsides, from fierce competition for students to the cost of recruiting staff, and that a high-quality brand and good lines of recruiting both undergraduates and postgraduates is therefore essential.\n\n\"London is just very expensive \u2013 some estimate up to 15-25% more than other parts of the country,\" he says. \"That has to be factored into salaries.\"\n\nCertainly, having satellite bases, particularly in pricey London, does not work for everybody, and while some in the sector have responded to uncertain times by exploring new locations, others have retrenched. By last year, De Montfort had consolidated to one campus. Gloucestershire University was forced to close its London campus two years ago after money problems, and the University of West London (the former Thames Valley University) shrank to just two campuses to pull itself out of financial disaster.\n\nOverseas campuses can be even more problematic. Renton says quality assurance can be more difficult, as can relations with academic staff. UCU is now gathering data on potential problems in this area.\n\nRenton argues that many of these campuses may also be less lucrative than they appear because many of the students they recruit are students that would otherwise have travelled to the UK to study.\n\nPeter Scott, professor of higher education at the Institute of Education, says that while setting up branch campuses can be fine for universities that are global brands, the ineffable essence of the institution may not translate so easily: \"All universities have their own habitats; they are 'places'. That atmosphere and ethos are not always easy to reproduce.\"\n\nBut how far does place matter in a globalised sector, where communication is increasingly carried out online rather than in a college quad?\n\nGillies, who is vice-chancellor of London Metropolitan University, says: \"Increasingly we are becoming less dependent on place in higher education.\" But he says students still want physical contact, as well as online learning.\n\nRenton agrees that \"there is no electronic substitute for students talking together and exchanging thoughts and ideas in order to dissect them in the presence of a senior leader\".\n\nBut he says there is no reason why these staff and students should all be from the same institution. His department already welcomes students from colleges affiliated to the University of London, such as Goldsmiths and Royal Holloway, to study specialist courses. \"There would be no good reason why, with goodwill on all sides, we couldn't be exchanging students with a wider group of institutions, and why other institutions couldn't do the same kind of thing,\" he says.\n\nBack to the Olympic Park, where Grainger says UCL would be keen to work with whatever other higher education providers end up there. UCL also hopes to build on its existing links with the University of East London. \"We see them as very good neighbours, with whom we work closely,\" he says.\n\nUCL will find other familiar neighbours, too. Also opening in Stratford is Birkbeck College, which is based just a few streets away from UCL's Bloomsbury home. From Autumn 2013, its new campus in Stratford centre \u2013 to be called University Square \u2013 will offer flexible day and evening courses, in a joint venture with the University of East London.\n\nFar from ending up a race between rivals, the future of higher education at the Olympic site \u2013 and quite possibly elsewhere \u2013 could be more about collaboration than competition.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2012/2/17/1329494081540/The-Olympic-Park-site-in--007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=228fa40a4530649c49e7a6ad99c36fe9", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Higher+education%2CUCL+%28University+College+London%29%2CUniversity+of+East+London%2CBirkbeck%2C+University+of+London%2CLondon+Metropolitan+University%2CUniversity+teaching%2CUniversity+administration%2CEducation", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2012/2/17/1329494081540/The-Olympic-Park-site-in--007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b22c86359b6ff38d13e4cbcf004cf66", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Education/Pix/pictures/2012/2/17/1329494081540/The-Olympic-Park-site-in--007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b22c86359b6ff38d13e4cbcf004cf66", "date": "20/02/2012"}, "rank_162": {"title": "London 2012: Game plan to boost community", "text": "Could playing in a team encourage people across the UK to build new ties with their neighbours and create an enduring legacy for the Games?

A few yards away, passing shoppers are excitedly flicking pieces across a wooden board as they get to grips with the table billiards game carom. Meanwhile, I am losing to all-comers at giant Jenga.\n\nThe level of sporting prowess on show may seem a million miles from the world-class performances we can expect to see this summer when London hosts the Olympics. But the afternoon of fun and games in Hackney, east London, is, its organisers claim, just the sort of event that can take the spirit of the Games out of the sports arena and into some of the country's most deprived communities.\n\nConfectionery firm Cadbury, which is pumping more than \u00a31m a year into the Spots v Stripes programme as part of its sponsorship of London 2012, says more than 120,000 people across the UK and Ireland have taken part in some 1,800 events involving sport. Including spectators, more than 900,000 people have been involved since the programme was launched in 2010.\n\nCadbury's charity partner Groundwork, which runs the events, has put on everything from family sports days to competitive bike mending workshops and from mock gameshows to football matches for blind people. The idea is that by playing for a team \u2013 the Spots or the Stripes \u2013 people of any age or background can have fun, build new relationships and so create stronger communities.\n\nAccording to an independent evaluation of the programme to be published this week, it's a recipe that works. More than three-quarters of participants surveyed for the report said the programme had allowed them to meet others of a different age or cultural background and 85% felt a greater sense of community after taking part. One in three said they were more likely to consider volunteering in their area as a result.\n\nPeter Taylor, professor of sport economics and co-director of the Sport Industry Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University, who drew up the report alongside researchers Ecorys, says the programme has been able to attract people who might feel excluded by the idea of elite sport, instead tapping into what he calls a \"universal need\" to play games. \"The programme essentially involves bringing people together to play games \u2013 which is a very positive form of social engagement. The effect on volunteers, participants and associated spectators is clearly positive,\" he says. \"Society often marginalises play as being only relevant to children, but all people need play in one form or another to lighten their lives.\"\n\nTaylor estimates that every \u00a31 invested in the scheme creates a social return, or benefit to the community, of \u00a31.90. The figure is calculated by putting a value on key benefits, such as increased feelings of community safety, greater participation and employment opportunities.\n\nIt is \"very encouraging\" that 80%of the events so far have taken place in the top 25% of the most disadvantaged communities, says Taylor.\n\nNorman Brodie, general manager of Cadbury London 2012, says the company has, as part of the programme, spent money improving nine recreation areas near its offices and factories across the UK and Ireland. But the main focus, he stresses, has been on creating the social glue that binds communities together \u2013 a much tougher task, he believes. \"If you are rejuvenating a park, you have a date for the bulldozers to come in, a date for the work to be done and for the mayor to cut the ribbon. The brave decision is to invest in people when you don't have a timetable of results in the same way,\" he says.\n\n\"But when you go to events, you can see the difference it makes. I saw a young Sikh lad sitting down with an old man playing draughts, and they would never have been brought together but for something like this. Making these connections and bringing people together is very powerful.\"\n\nThere is a potential benefit too for volunteers working with Groundwork to run the events. Already 85 people across the UK have been able to use the experience they have gained to secure a job.\n\nNatalie Skerritt, 21, a volunteer at the Hackney event, is hoping to do just that. \"I can't find work, so this is good for me in building my confidence,\" she says. \"We have put on events on housing association estates where we have had all the community coming together. We get a lot of bad media about this area, but people are pleased to have the opportunity of doing something positive.\"\n\nMany more events will take place across the country as Olympic fever intensifies. But can the benefits be sustained? The programme is due to come to an end when the Games close, but Cadbury and Groundwork are exploring how to continue to reap the rewards of games playing, perhaps through new, more localised programmes or a package of grant funding for specific projects.\n\nNaomi Pietersen, Groundwork's community team manager in Hackney, says the Olympics have already had a positive impact in helping to spark community spirit. \"This is the real legacy,\" she says. \"People are going to have the skills to carry this on and the confidence to run events in their community.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Society/Comment/Columnist/2012/3/19/1332158452788/People-in-Hackney-east-Lo-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8720d1f24153f3f9d21c9360ff73b2fe", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Society/Comment/Columnist/2012/3/19/1332158452788/People-in-Hackney-east-Lo-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5f2b880626f4eaa697937d2d1cd3e14b", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Communities%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CCharities%2CVoluntary+sector%2CSociety%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Society/Comment/Columnist/2012/3/19/1332158452788/People-in-Hackney-east-Lo-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5f2b880626f4eaa697937d2d1cd3e14b", "date": "20/03/2012"}, "rank_166": {"title": "London 2012 has 'raised the bar' on legacy planning, says IOC president", "text": "Jacques Rogge, president of the International Olympic Committee, has hailed the \"legacy blueprint\" laid down by the London Games before Wednesday's meeting with the prime minister, David Cameron, and its final inspection visit.\n\nIt was the legacy promises made by the London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, in Singapore in 2005 that helped secure the Games, with the IOC particularly concerned to engage with a new generation.\n\nIn order to create continued competition among potential host cities, the IOC also recognises the need to prove that investing in an Olympics can be a driver of regeneration and leave a lasting legacy. Rogge said that London had delivered on its promises and created a new blueprint for future hosts.\n\n\"London has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy. We can already see tangible results in the remarkable regeneration of east London. This great historical city has created a legacy blueprint for future Games hosts,\" said Rogge.\n\nCameron said the opportunity to deliver on the myriad legacy promises made on behalf of the Games was the government's biggest challenge and the greatest opportunity.\n\n\"Legacy has been built into the DNA of London 2012. But by definition, of course, the true legacy of London 2012 lies in the future,\" he said. \"Though much has been done, I am acutely aware that the drive to embed and secure the benefits of London 2012 is still to come. That is our biggest challenge. It's also our greatest opportunity.\"\n\nThe focus on legacy is part of a government drive to reframe the debate and highlight the benefits as justification for investing \u00a39.3bn of public money in them at a time of austerity.\n\nThe government has been stung by criticism over areas of the promised legacy, most obviously in sports participation where a target introduced by Labour to use the Games to inspire one million more people to play more sport had to be dropped amid negligible progress, and will today publish a new 80-page document called Beyond 2012 as part of an attempt to redress the balance.\n\nCameron and the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, are expected to highlight the progress made in securing a lasting legacy for six of the eight permanent Olympic venues, despite the ongoing debate over the future of the iconic stadium.\n\nAnother recurring theme is the extent to which the Olympics have proved a boon to British business and acted as a calling card for the UK economy, as well as driving the regeneration of east London.\n\nThere has also been criticism of the decision to slash the dedicated school sport budget by more than half only 18 months before the Olympics.\n\nBut Hunt and the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, will counter it by pointing to the new School Games scheme backed by Sainsbury's \u2013 a network of inter and intra school sports competitions culminating in finals in the Olympic Park \u2013 and a reworked plan to encourage more grass-roots youth sport.\n\nThe IOC's co-ordination commission delegation, led by its chair, Denis Oswald, will start its final two-day inspection visit following the meeting at Downing Street, which will also be attended by Lord Coe.\n\nIt is the last of 10 visits to monitor London's progress that began in 2006 and, like those that preceded it, will largely consist of a series of in-depth updates on various aspects of the London 2012 preparation.\n\nAs well as the latest \"Get Ahead of the Games\" transport campaign to try to prepare businesses and the public for potential bottlenecks during the Games, the IOC will also be updated on the plans for the last phase of the sometimes controversial ticketing process.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2012/3/27/1332870206186/Olympic-Park-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=29793a22e2fca0bd2882f9f83cc024fc", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CLondon%2CInternational+Olympic+Committee%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2012/3/27/1332870206186/Olympic-Park-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1bdec28aeaef97f4ec4feb7fd035c81d"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2012/3/27/1332870206186/Olympic-Park-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1bdec28aeaef97f4ec4feb7fd035c81d", "date": "27/03/2012"}, "rank_98": {"title": "David Cameron discusses London 2012 Olympics security and legacy \u2013 video", "text": "The prime minister said legacy planning for the summer Games was further ahead at this stage than for any previous host city, and it was time to 'tear up any notion of leaving behind white elephants'.

But will these leave a lasting legacy? Join the debate Friday 4 May at 12 BST\n\nEarlier this year Andy Miah asked: what will the olympics do for higher education in the UK? Given that I'm naturally sceptical of the claims that these sort of events will do anything more than make the athletes who do well celebrities and make money for businesses and individuals who already have the networks or resources needed to capitalise on these opportunities, I thought Andy's was a darn good question.\n\nBut not only did he ask it, he then provided some answers: \"From setting up undergraduate modules on media training to building links with hospitality courses or security, there is hardly one dimension of the higher education sector that has not been reached by the Olympic programme in some way.\" He also added: \"The Games have given rise to cross-sector collaborations, particularly between education and the arts sector.\"\n\nAnd he's not the only one to celebrate the sector's contribution to this major sporting event. The focus of the annual UK Universities Week is unsurprisingly the Olympic Games and a report published on Monday, points out that 94% of higher education institutions across the UK are, or plan to be, involved in Games-related projects. But what happens after the Games are finished?\n\nWhile there is little doubt that the Games have long captured - and continue to capture - the interest of academia, is it possible for HEIs to use the Olympics to transformative effect long-term - both inside and outside their walls? And if they can, what is the scope of that legacy? Does it end with improved student experience - perhaps through new gym equipment campuses will potentially inherit from resident teams - or can the Games also impact on other aspects of higher education?\n\nOn Friday 4 May, we'll gather a panel, as international as the Olympics themselves, to discuss how universities can - and should be contributing to the Olympics legacy.

Why should somebody be able to force you out of your home? A home that's got nothing wrong with it, that's standing solid? I do not want to go.\"\n\nSlow dispersal of the estate's residents, mostly to alternative dwellings nearby, has been in progress for some time. This has been justified for Wales by the need to embrace a host of development opportunities created not only by the draw of the Games and the park but also, just as importantly, by the economic arteries formed by the improved transport hub at Stratford station. Already, the giant Westfield Stratford City shopping centre has been a hit.\"It's always a balance if you want to do something for an area,\" Wales says. \"What is the wider community getting at the expense of the inconvenience caused to local residents? People in Carpenters are concerned. I would be too. I completely understand that. But with UCL we would get an amazing, top university coming to the area. Our vision is for science and hi-tech providing jobs and skills. It would be such a good offer from the point of view of our kids.\"\n\nFinch is not alone in being unenthusiastic. Two younger residents, Joe Alexander and Osita Madu, are driving forces in the campaign group Carp \u2013 Carpenters Against Regeneration Plan \u2013 which has been quarrelling with Wales's pledges to treat residents properly, bombarding him with questions at public meetings. They reason that the Carpenters works well as a community, so why dismantle it? \"We're not some kind of social ill or blight on the landscape that needs help,\" says Maduu. \"Somehow Newham council thinks we're a social problem that needs to be addressed.\"\n\n\"We voted for a mayor and got a dictator,\" adds Alexander.\n\nIt is, in many ways, an archetypal urban regeneration conflict between local authorities on a mission to improve, and those on their patch who fear they only stand to lose. Strife also marked the clearance of the Olympic Park site, when a twilit labyrinth of small industrial concerns was removed from the land on which the array of sports venues now awaits the world's athletic elite.\n\nAmong them was H Forman and Son, a family salmon-smoking business founded in east London by a Jewish migrant from Odessa in 1905. The proprietor, Harry Forman's great-grandson Lance, had his premises where the Olympic stadium now is. He fought a long compensation battle and celebrated victory with an email to the Games organiser Lord Coe, a former Olympic champion whom he'd been due to cross-examine at a public inquiry. The email said: \"You can run, but you can't hide.\"\n\nThe upshot is a handsome, salmon-pink building on a bank of the river Lea, containing not only a smokery, but also a restaurant and an art gallery in a location long called, with glorious suitability, Fish Island. Olympic dignitaries and others now congregate there. The stadium looms across the water. Forman will soon erect a pop-up corporate hospitality venue on a piece of adjoining land he owns, complete with recreational beach volleyball court. Speedo was the first big name to take space in this Fish Island Riviera, and Forman is finalising discussions with others.\n\n\"We're going to have some luxury yachts along the riverfront,\" he enthuses. \"Sixty palm trees are being shipped in. We're going to have this beach club that turns into a nightclub.\"\n\nForman hopes to emerge a winner from the Games, but says business is still recovering from the disruption caused by compulsory purchase. He hopes to be part of long-term rejuvenation by developing the land his Riviera will briefly occupy, perhaps with a mixture of homes and boutiques, and facilities for the arts community that has flourished in recent years in former warehouses along the towpath in Hackney Wick. Forging links, he invited a graffiti artist to enhance his restaurant's toilets. In the gents, fine silver fish leap skywards above the urinals.\n\n\"I think the area was regenerating anyway,\" Forman says, looking across at the stadium. \"But the existence of the park ought to help. I think when people come here they're amazed at how impressive it already is and how easy to get to.\"\n\nLondon's outgoing Olympic legacy chief, Margaret Ford, also gives an upbeat assessment of the post-Games future of the 200-hectare park and its immediate surroundings, although she warns that expecting it to be \"the catalyst for the regeneration of the whole of east London\", has \"never been entirely realistic\". Citing prior experience with renewing England's coalfield communities, she stressed the need for \"continued investment and belief over a long period\".\n\nFord steps down as chair of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) this month, having led it and its predecessor, the Olympic Park Legacy Company, since May 2009. She says the park should be an example of how you \"change the psychology\" about an area. \"You're hoping that the whole view of investing in east London changes by persuading people that it is a fabulous place to come to and do business and invest.\"\n\nShe accepts that a great fear with large regeneration projects is that the wealth they attract fails to benefit existing residents, many of whom are in pressing need. Canary Wharf, whose glass towers pierce the skyline a short distance away, is often condemned as the ultimate example. \"The concern is that the park will become a sort of golden city on a hill surrounded by a sea of poverty,\" says John Biggs, a former City analyst and senior Labour member of the London Assembly, who represents three of the six Olympic boroughs \u2013 Tower Hamlets, Newham and Barking and Dagenham.\n\nFord, a Labour peer held in high regard across the political spectrum, says she and her board have been \"utterly preoccupied from day one\" with ensuring that local people derive the maximum value from the post-Games plans, and with facilitating the Olympic boroughs' goal of economic convergence with the richer west and centre of London. She is proud of creating training and schemes and close links with local schools. \"The big game-changers will be jobs and changes in educational attainment and aspiration for a lot of families in east London,\" she says.\n\nFord will depart with most of the arrangements made for putting the permanent sporting venues and other attractions to post-Games community use, and with decisions in the pipeline for the three big jigsaw pieces not yet in place:\n\n\u2022 The commercial occupants, either a fashion hub or digital \"innovation city\", for the two buildings the media will use during the Games.\n\n\u2022 The long-running search for tenants for the main stadium, very likely to include a football club.\n\n\u2022 The determination of planning applications for the future development of the park as a residential area and visitor destination.\n\nFive neighbourhoods will form within the boundaries of the park over the next 20 years, with the first, Chobham Manor, due to be completed at the end of 2014. Ford emphasised the importance of including sufficient genuinely affordable housing. \"I think we need to remember there was quite a big promise made to the communities in east London about the houses being affordable \u2013 either affordable to rent or affordable to buy. I think it's one they are not going to forget.\"\n\nWhile pointing out that the LLDC remains committed to 35% of the up to 8,000 homes it plans to see built on the park being affordable \u2013 in addition to 3,000 that the Athletes' Village will be converted into \u2013 she felt it was a matter for regret for London as a whole that the government's new funding approach means \"affordable\" rent can now be up to 80% of local market rates, which even in poorer parts of London are high compared with the rest of the country.\n\n\"I think Londoners are desperately short of affordable housing. It's definitely short of good-quality social housing [which has far lower rents]. If we mean what we say about needing to house all of our key workers, we need to house lots of people in lower-paid jobs who make this city work then, yes, I would say moving to 80% of market rents will cause some of those people not to be able to afford properties.\"\n\nAnother Olympic borough mayor, Tower Hamlets' independent Lutfur Rahman, who, like Wales, is a member of the LLDC board, has called for more homes for social rent among the 800 housing units proposed for the Olympic Park neighbourhood to be called Sweetwater, which will fall within his boundaries.\n\nFord, who has 33 years' experience of delivering regeneration programmes under both Labour and Conservative governments, is to be replaced by the Conservative politician Daniel Moylan, the appointee of London's mayor, Boris Johnson, to whom the LLDC is accountable. The selection of Moylan, an experienced councillor in Royal Kensington and Chelsea whom Johnson made his deputy as chair of Transport for London two years ago, has caused some disquiet among political opponents.\n\nBiggs says that although he likes the urbane Moylan \u2013 \"he's fun to talk to\" \u2013 he worries that he is not equipped to follow someone with Ford's track record. \"The truth is, he doesn't know anything about regeneration.\" There's an ideological issue too. \"The point of bodies like the development corporation is to do the things the market can't or won't, and Daniel is the sort of politician who thinks red-in-tooth-and-claw market forces will take care of everything.\"\n\nFord, though, says she's confident Johnson has made a good choice and praises him for allowing her and her chief executive, Andrew Altman, to produce a new masterplan for the park. The one she'd inherited, she says, \"pretty much had the place populated by high rise buildings. Why would you stuff it full of flats when it's an obvious family housing neighbourhood, given the green space and the venues? We didn't want to create some pastiche of the Old Curiosity Shop, but a place that had squares and crescents and little pocket parks \u2013 the kinds of things that make London quite higgledy piggledy but recognisably London. Boris was hugely encouraging.\"\n\nShe gathered intelligence for the masterplan on \"mystery shopping\" excursions \u2013 chatting to people in cafes and the old Stratford shopping centre. \"They wanted front gardens, back gardens for their kids to play in, really good lighting, lots of storage space, nice green spaces, somewhere they can afford and a decent school \u2013 it's not bloody rocket science.\"\n\nWhen the park begins to reopen for the public next July, its name will change to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Ford believes the royal touch will enhance local attachment: \"It's about creating a different feel about the place. It's about people having a pride in it.\"\n\nEven so, while Olympic borough schools gear up for the excitement of the summer, renaming their classes Helsinki, Tokyo and Beijing, parents express a mix of views about the value of the changes underway. Martin Sadler, a resident of Hackney who works in education and lives with his wife and two daughters not far from the park, foresees a good and a bad side.\n\n\"I think this part of Hackney will start feeling a bit more like central London and less like east London,\" he says. \"I've lived here for over 20 years, and it's always been a traditional East End sort of place \u2013 a real mixture of people, plenty of cheap accommodation. It's already becoming more affluent, partly because the schools have improved. That brings good things with it, but there are worries too. I think London could be getting more like Paris \u2013 that doughnut effect, with the poorer people having to move out of the centre.\"\n\nThat is not the outcome legacy idealists say they have in mind. Time will tell if they manage to avoid it.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CLondon+politics%2CPlanning+policy%2CPolitics%2CRegeneration%2CCommunities%2CSociety%2CUCL+%28University+College+London%29%2CHigher+education%2CEducation%2CArchitecture%2CBusiness%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "13/06/2012"}, "rank_271": {"title": "London 2012 legacy: 'The Olympics has cost me my home' - video", "text": "The Carpenters estate on the fringe of London's Olympic park faces demolition as part of a regeneration scheme that Newham council believes will benefit the whole area.

The auguries are not good. The last two Games in London, in 1908 and 1948, endured atrocious weather and competitions were severely disrupted. Shortly after the opening ceremony in 1908, the heavens opened. Very soon the sodden conditions of the track and turf took their toll. The cycle track became flooded; the outdoor swimming pool became murky and unhealthy; the rifle shooters complained of high winds and poor light; the tennis had to be transferred indoors from Wimbledon; and the rugby final was nearly abandoned as fog descended.\n\nOn marathon day, the weather changed dramatically. The temperature hit the 80s and the roads became burning hot. About half the runners dropped out, dehydrated by excessive heat, and from the effects of alcohol \u2013 the beer, champagne and spirits \u2013 readily plied to runners by the enthusiastic spectators. Some authorities claim the dramatic collapse of Dorando Pietri in the stadium was caused more by intoxication than anything else.\n\nNor was the weather any better in 1948. A scorching heatwave, violent storms and torrential rain, meant the conditions were the worst in Olympic history. The opening ceremony was held on the hottest day since 1911 and several athletes fainted. After that, the rain fell in buckets and the track was often completely flooded. Despite this, and the country's severe \"austerity\" programme, the British public responded magnificently. Huddling stoically together under their raincoats, umbrellas, blankets and newspapers, they marvelled at the feats of the Olympians such as the Czech runner Emil Zatopek, and Fanny Blankers-Koen.\n\nKeith Baker\n\nSheffield\n\n\u2022 Stratford is being transformed by the Olympics (Report, 14 June), and the council is determined to change the social profile of the area by \"decanting\" residents from the Carpenters Estate. But on 1 January our council celebrated the start of the Olympic year with its promise to create a step change in sporting participation, by closing the nearest swimming pool to the Olympic park. Sadly, also, much of what the area is gaining is temporary. Many Olympic venues will be demolished soon after the closing ceremony, as they have been built for minority sports that will not generate income.\n\nMuch of what would serve as a real asset to Newham will also be destroyed. A bridge has been built across the busy A11 so those using the Docklands Light Railway can walk safely to the venues. This is also being ripped down, even though it would make a value contribution to cycling and walking and enjoying the new Olympic park, which was supposed to be a legacy of the Games.\n\nSimon Shaw\n\nLondon\n\n\u2022 This is the country in which Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens, Newton and Darwin lived and worked, the country of Magna Carta and the home of parliamentary democracy, where the industrial revolution began, the first iron ship built, the first railway system laid down, the first jet airliner built and the hovercraft invented. The country that boasts a plethora of Nobel prize winners, whose top half dozen universities are (still) the envy of most of the world. And what do we get for the start of the Olympic Games (The real Britain, 13 June)? Sheep, chickens and dancing round a maypole. What a shambles. What a lost opportunity to show the real Britain.\n\nMichael Abraham\n\nLondon\n\n\u2022 Sebastian Coe has blocked, and thus ignored, substantial numbers of emails, including ours, sent to him as a result of a recent appeal by Amnesty International to undo the damage the London Olympics' contract with the Dow Chemical Corporation (which has provided the \"wrap\" for the Olympic stadium) has caused in the context of the Bhopal disaster.\n\nWe, like many others, feel the partnership with Dow has tainted the Games, through association with one of the most egregious cases of corporate negligence in recent history.

Ford had intended to stay until after the Games but was persuaded to leave early.\n\nThe pair decided to tear up plans to build high rise apartments and instead focused on family friendly housing in the north of the Park and a more urban feel in the south of the 500 acre site, to be renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park after the Games.\n\nBut they also endured a bruising battle over the fate of the \u00a3468m Olympic Stadium. They awarded it to West Ham but were then forced to abandon the deal in the face of legal pressure from Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient, and a complaint to the European Commission that it may have broken state aid rules.\n\nA new tender process was launched, inviting applicants from would-be tenants. The deadline was recently extended to attract more bids amid tense negotiations with West Ham, who want to move in on their terms.\n\nBut Ford and Altman say that six of the eight permanent venues in the Park now have a legacy tenant in place, with only the stadium and the cavernous media centre still to be finalised.\n\n\"It has been a tremendous honour to lead once in a lifetime project that will transform the face of London and will be spectacular example of city building the world over,\" said Altman, who will leave in August after the Olympics.\n\n\"I am proud to have been able to set a clear vision, resources and commercial investment.

The increases are driven by those over 26 and the percentage of 16- to 25-year-olds playing sport once a week has declined since 2005.\n\nThe number of 18-year-olds playing any of the nine sports specifically targeted for tackling \"drop off\" among those leaving school has also declined, from 189,100 in 2008 to 181,700 last year. No previous Olympics has ever sparked an increase in the number of people playing sport and the government's legacy plans have attracted consistent scrutiny. Last year, the Guardian revealed the government planned to drop the target introduced by the last administration to get 1m more people playing sport three or more times a week by 2013, amid negligible progress.\n\nThe sports minister Hugh Robertson has admitted that the target, which he said measured the wrong thing in the wrong way, should have been dropped earlier. The new figures show that Sport England is halfway to meeting that now defunct target, increasing the figure to 7.3m, an improvement of 400,000 on last year.\n\nAmong individual sports, the picture remains extremely mixed. Eighteen sports show an upward trend since \u00a3480m was committed in 2009 to a new four-year strategy of investing money through governing bodies. Of those 18, three sports \u2013 rugby union, rugby league and tennis \u2013 have only increased because their baseline figure was reset after they were docked money for failing to make progress.\n\nFourteen sports have seen their numbers decline, with swimming by far the worst performer. The number of people swimming at least once a week has declined by almost 440,000 since 2009.\n\n\"This is a strong set of results, with all of the key measures showing participation in sport is increasing. As we approach the London Games some of our key sports such as cycling and hockey are already beginning to feel the Olympic effect,\" said Sport England chief executive Jennie Price. \"I am particularly pleased that there has also been a sharp increase in the number of disabled people who are playing sport every week.\"\n\nThe Department of Culture, Media and Sport unveiled a new strategy, targeting 60% of the \u00a3450m that will be invested through sports governing bodies from 2013 onwards on youth sport. They will be charged with building better links between schools and clubs.\n\n\"With the London 2012 Games round the corner it's encouraging that sports participation is on the rise. Hosting the Games will give us the platform to go even further and inspire many more to take up sport,\" said the culture secretary Jeremy Hunt. \"We want people to have a sporting habit for life. Going forward sports governing bodies will target the 14- to 25-year-old age group to do just that and strengthen grassroots sport across the country.\"\n\nBut critics of the government plans fear that a reduction in ringfenced funding for school sport and the lack of a coherent national strategy across government departments mean that it will struggle to reverse the trend among young people.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/6/22/1340366448171/Cyclist-in-Manchester-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2f73c70ad678644ab5df7700752df298", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/6/22/1340366448171/Cyclist-in-Manchester-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6aeddb0f86374c1a4bcfe062624ab0cd", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSebastian+Coe%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/6/22/1340366448171/Cyclist-in-Manchester-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2f73c70ad678644ab5df7700752df298", "date": "22/06/2012"}, "rank_261": {"title": "London 2012: Olympic training camps spread Games fever across the UK", "text": "Pakistan's hockey teams are heading to Cannock in Staffordshire. The Belarussian judo squad will be using the facilities at Tonbridge school in Kent. And for two weeks in July, the Forum sports complex in Antrim, Northern Ireland, will be the temporary home of the Egyptian athletics delegation.\n\nLondon has entered the final stage of its preparations for the Olympics, and across Britain scores of other towns and cities are also getting ready to welcome the world's greatest athletes this summer. Encouraged by the organiser, Locog, as part of its commitment to spread the Olympic legacy far beyond the capital, thousands of international competitors will spend the final few weeks before the Games training with their colleagues in pools, gyms and stadiums from Aberdeen to Plymouth, Swansea to Richmond-upon-Thames.\n\nFor the athletes, the pre-Games training camps will carve out a valuable space for them to bond with their teammates, perfect last-minute tweaks to their performance and acclimatise to whatever weather the British summer lays on for them.\n\nFor the communities that will host them, however, the camps offer an opportunity to participate in the pre-Olympics buzz, and claim a share in direct and indirect financial benefits totalling many millions of pounds \u2013 a prospect that has led to intense competition between councils, universities and sporting facilities across the country.\n\nThe need to supply training facilities for Olympic delegations from across the world has resulted in some unlikely cultural pairings. The Antiguan and Barbudan athletics squad, for instance, will be based in the Guildford Spectrum in Surrey, while the Gambian delegation will be based at the Huntington athletics stadium at the University of York. And in Wrexham, north Wales, the council's leisure manager, Ken Danskin, is making preparations to welcome the Olympic team from Lesotho, likely to number, at current estimates, between seven and nine athletes plus a handful of officials.\n\nDespite the modest size of the Lesotho delegation, Danskin says, the local sporting groups who may be called on to work with the athletes \u2013 providing a sparring partner, for instance, for the boxers who are expected to qualify, or pace-setters for the three or more marathon-runners Lesotho hopes to bring \u2013 are \"buzzing\" at the prospect. Local school and community groups, too, are excited about the visit, meaning that one of the challenges for the council will be protecting the athletes from too many demands on their time.\n\n\"It's not a huge team, so while we're aware that they are going to have down-time, we have to be mindful of not over-pushing them into doing stuff,\" says Danskin.\n\nThe competitors are spending only a fortnight at the Queensway sports ground in the middle of a Wrexham housing estate before heading for the Olympic village, but for the council, their presence is the culmination of years of determined lobbying.\n\nIn Wrexham's case, and that of all the Welsh facilities seeking to host athletes, the decision was taken early on to lobby centrally through \"a pre-Games training taskforce\" set up by the Welsh assembly to attract international delegations to Wales. A representative flew to Beijing in 2008, says Danskin, \"to tout for business the same as most countries did in Europe, talking to national Olympic committees and saying, 'Have you considered ... ?'\"\n\nPerhaps inevitably, the world-class athletic and swimming facilities in Cardiff and Swansea, and the Wales National velodrome in Newport, attracted the bulk of the 19 Olympic and Paralympic delegations coming to Wales; in Wrexham's case, the appeal to Lesotho may have been helped by long-standing educational links with the country. The Queen of Lesotho visited Maelor high school in 2010. The students there are already preparing what one sixth-former, Dylan Gallanders, called \"a massive welcome\" for the Lesothan athletes. \"All of us in the school are really excited about the team coming. You would hope by the time they arrive it's the same across Wrexham.\"\n\nIf the intense competition between communities to host an Olympic delegation can be explained in part by the cultural prestige and community benefits such a training camp brings, the critical factor for many teams in choosing a British training base was financial.\n\nIn 2008, Locog published a list of 600 facilities across Britain that had applied for accreditation as approved potential training camp venues, attracted by the prospect of a grant of \u00a325,000 offered to every Olympic delegation willing to base itself in the UK.\n\n\"This is a real opportunity for communities across the UK to capitalise on the benefits that hosting 2012 offers,\" the then Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, said. \"There will be fierce competition to host foreign teams and individuals, and now it is for every nation and region, every venue, to sell itself internationally.\"\n\nThough it has not published a comprehensive list of every facility that will host overseas athletes, more than 200 individual sporting delegations from 93 different nations have signed agreements to train in British facilities, Locog said in April, translating into more than \u00a32.3m spent directing the Olympic legacy into the heart of communities across the UK.\n\nThe \u00a325,000 grant may have been \"absolutely key\" to Lesotho's ability to come before the Games, and offer a welcome boost to Glyndwr University, formerly the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education, which will host the delegation in its student accommodation, but in other cases, the grant was of negligible consideration.\n\nBirmingham is one of the biggest winners in the scramble to attract international delegations, having persuaded both the American and Jamaican track and field teams to base themselves in the city \u2013 though the two will train in strict isolation from each other.\n\nIf the smaller Olympic teams were eagerly fought over, says Steve Hollingworth, assistant director of sports and events for Birmingham city council, the competition to attract the best and highest profile athletics squads in the world was ferocious. The city first opened discussions with Team USA in 2006, he says, while a delegation from the city was invited to the Beijing camp in 2008 to get a sense of quite how exacting the team's standards were. A memorandum of understanding was signed the following year, subject to Birmingham making upgrades to its Alexander stadium \u2013 including remodelling the layout and re-laying the track \u2013 to bring it in line with the team's expectations.\n\nBirmingham was more than happy to comply, says Hollingworth. \"What you have to remember here is how hard it was to get the teams. From 2008, there were cities in the UK talking to the USA and Jamaica, and on the continent. Regularly. It was a bidding process, and therefore part of our bid was to offer as much as we could, within our budget restraints, to make sure they chose Birmingham.\" The US squad, accordingly, will be offered the use of civic facilities free of charge.\n\nBenita Fitzgerald Mosley, chief of sport performance for USA Track and Field, is unapologetic about making such demands. \"We want to make sure we get the most ideal location for our team, so we get started early. That obviously means world-class track and field facilities, but we also wanted to find great trails for our distance runners, weight room, training room, medical facilities, and also potentially an indoor facility for inclement weather, and Birmingham had all that.\"\n\nThe athletes will stay in a central Birmingham hotel \u2013 though the city has not disclosed its identity for security reasons \u2013 where team officials have checked the strength of training-room floors to ensure they can bear the weight of two or more ice baths.\n\nThe smaller Jamaican team, meanwhile, will be based at Birmingham University, where they will stay in halls of residence in which a number of extra-long beds have been installed to accommodate the 1.96-metre-tall Usain Bolt and others. While they were inevitably attracted by the university's sporting facilities and what its director of sport, Zena Wooldridge, calls \"a department which is a bit like a spaceship of sports science provision\", the city's multicultural heritage was also a factor, she says. \"We'll have a Jamaican chef coming in as well to work alongside them, but our own chefs are quite used to doing Jamaican food because we do a lot of weddings for the Jamaican community \u2026 We're going to make sure that every small component part is right, because it's that that can determine whether it's a gold medal or a silver medal.\"\n\nBirmingham has calculated that hosting the teams will bring benefits worth \u00a320m to the city, but to Hollingworth the value of their visit goes beyond the financial. \"Birmingham wants to be an international city, and having the fastest people on earth choose Birmingham reinforces us as a world class city of sport. And the world's media will be here. Two weeks before the Games, we hope, the focus will be on Birmingham, not London.\"\n\nIn Wrexham, meanwhile, the council has been given an organisational headache of the most welcome kind. The Lesothan Swimming Association confirmed last week that it plans to send a swimmer, Masempe Theko, though she has yet to decide which stroke to compete in, according to the association's general secretary.

And those who can are clearing out for the duration. But there will be no escape. The Olympics will still be there when they get back because it will leave behind amazing infrastructure that will be an asset to their community for years to come.\n\nThe Games has given the East End a complete new train line and one major line upgrade, a light railway line extension plus a repulsive yet useful Westfield shopping mall.\n\nAnd, oh, I nearly forgot. There's the sport. And for all \u2013 not just the elite. On our doorstep will be fantastic Olympic facilities that if managed correctly will be the catalyst for future East End achievement and fulfilment. Unlike most Games in other cities, hundreds of thousands of people actually live where new facilities are located. You can almost feel the pent-up determination to use them.\n\nOur appetite has been whetted by the seven-year run-up to the Games, which has seen an injection of money into school and community sport. My kids get steeply discounted basketball, BMX and swimming coaching. They have the opportunity to play sport with disabled kids, which they seize with relish.The worry is the funding will be switched off once the caravan has passed through. We need to shame the purse string holders to continue what they started. But that's for another day. We are incredibly lucky to have the Games in our manor.\n\nAnna Minton, author of Ground Control: Fear and Happiness in the 21st Century\n\nI agree the new transport connections brought about indirectly by the Games are great for Stratford. But I feel the way the development of the area has been handled is not only all wrong but deeply anachronistic. The Olympic Park to date is a new \"quarter\" of London built on an outdated Docklands model. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is not a royal park and the new places within it are not public. Instead they are privately owned and privately controlled. So, the Olympic Village, the first neighbourhood to be completed, has been sold off to a consortium led by the Qatari royal family.\n\nThere are many problems with this, not least the fact that the taxpayer foots the bill. This is a model of development based on very large amounts of debt, borrowed on the premise of ever increasing property values. But with the financial crisis the model collapsed, with the private sector unable to borrow the money. At the same time as we bailed out the banks we also bailed out the Olympics to the tune of an extra \u00a35.7bn. According to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, the private sector has only contributed 2% of a budget that now tops \u00a310bn. All over the UK this model of development has stalled, leaving construction sites empty, because this is a model that doesn't add up any more, unless we, the taxpayer, pay for it.\n\nI'm glad your kids are enthused by the sport and I hope they enjoy the Games. I just think it's such a missed opportunity that the development has followed a model stuck in the past.\n\nNM It was the International Olympic Committee's assessment that transport was a weak link within the original London bid. This forced the government to accelerate its investment in new lines. They have indisputably opened up huge tracts of previously hard-to-reach areas of the East End, plugging them into the London network and beyond. It is an utter boon. And without the Games, they would likely still lie on the drawing board. The economic downturn would have seen to that.\n\nSure, the Olympic Park \u2013 I refuse to call it Queen Elizabeth's \u2013 will be privately owned. How else are we meant to pay for this? So far 75% of the cost of building the Olympic village has been recouped in deals, not just with the Qataris but with housing associations too. Is that bad?\n\nThe thing about the Olympics is that you have effectively got six years to build them. So the state has to get involved. I like the idea of a big vision by a courageous state transforming a largely poisoned, redundant, post-industrial 500-acre wasteland with amazing facilities.\n\nI think what is now important is to focus on ensuring that the Olympic Park brings education and employment opportunities for local people to bring down horrendous rates of unemployment and drive up achievement levels.\n\nAM There is no disagreement between us when it comes to the improvement of transport links. What I'm concerned about is that the model of development pursued, based on \"trickledown\" economics, is precisely one that does not bring opportunities to local people. We know, from Docklands and the Isle Of Dogs a generation ago, that wealth does not trickle down to the poorest places that need it the most.\n\nAffordable housing has been at the centre of legacy promises and indeed we are told that half the homes in the Olympic village will be affordable. The Olympic boroughs are among the poorest in the country and affordable housing is desperately needed. Yet now the definition of affordable housing has been changed to mean up to 80% of market rent and that is not affordable at all to the vast majority of local people.\n\nBefore London won the bid, an ethical Olympics agreement was signed by the former mayor and the Olympic bidding committee, which included pledges on local jobs, training and affordable housing. But when the Olympic Delivery Authority took over after London won the bid, they refused to honour the agreement, claiming that \"it is illegal to dictate the terms of contracts struck under open tender\". So much for the Olympic spirit.\n\nNM True, employment opportunities from the Olympics have not lived up to the hype so far. Just 25% of contractors during the build phase lived in the Olympic boroughs, according to the Olympic Delivery Authority. But 35% of the eventual 11,000 units to be built on the Olympic Park will be affordable. That is substantial, even though moving the \"affordable\" goalposts is definitely not good.\n\nIf the Olympic Park creates another bankers' ghetto like Canary Wharf, it will have utterly failed. But I do not think it will end up like that. For one thing, unlike the Wharf, this is a public-facing project. And the fact that sport facilities are involved changes the dynamic.\n\nWhat will be crucial is the eventual use of the Media Centre. The tenant selected for this will be pivotal in determining the employment nature of the park. But in a broader sense the Olympics has put the East End on the world map. The challenge is to ensure it's sustained. That things such as community sport, which has progressed, remain funded. Otherwise the Games will be just for show.\n\nAM I think it's very unlikely that 11,000 homes will be built in the Olympic Park. I think there is now an opportunity for the Olympic legacy to be handled very differently from what has gone so far. Daniel Moylan, the new chair of the Mayoral Development Corporation, which takes over from the Olympic Park Legacy Company, has said that he wants a clean break from the old Docklands model, which he described as a \"fortress\". Instead he has said that he wants the streets and public places under his remit \u2013 which spans an area considerably larger than the park \u2013 to be genuinely public. Of course, it's too late for the Olympic village but excepting that, this indication of a desire to do things differently could result in what you describe as a \"public-facing\" project and what I would call development that is genuinely in the public interest for the rest of the park. The problem is there isn't going to be any money. But as far as I'm concerned a willingness to break with what has gone before is at least a start.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/7/6/1341592367612/Olympics-2012---Bordering-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ab2971ff80331b2d7e08fec3e2b088b", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/7/6/1341592367612/Olympics-2012---Bordering-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=acba7e41d4eafa55ad291744e909ea31", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/5/1341487501381/Brick-Lane-003.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=af403444d9cb89992b97e5c3a1d8a1e0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/7/3/1341316190704/rachel-whiteread-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6d86f31202bd65dffe6a0dfcf3eb0653", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CLondon%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/7/6/1341592367612/Olympics-2012---Bordering-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=acba7e41d4eafa55ad291744e909ea31", "date": "07/07/2012"}, "rank_270": {"title": "London legacy: security and towpath protests", "text": "Section of River Lea navigation canal next to Olympic Park closed off and guarded by soldiers in tent. Photograph: Dave Hill\n\nIt's not as dramatic as having anti-aircraft missiles planted on your roof, but the closure of a popular walking and cycling route that borders the western edge of the Olympic Park has prompted the same sort of resentment among some local people. I'm feeling just a touch of it myself.\n\nOn Sunday, personal experience confirmed that my regular run from my home in Clapton to the Olympic stadium and back will not be possible again until 10 September for reasons of Games security. The towpath on the eastern bank of the River Lea navigation canal was fenced off just past Hackney Marshes, at the point where the A12 flies over it, all the way to Bow to the south.\n\nA small group of demonstrators had gathered in protest at the Marshes end, distinguished by bicycles, waterproof garments and small children. Police officers stood in attendance. Behind the wire I made out a figure in military fatigues next to a little tent. Beyond him, the Olympic press centre stood behind the perimeter fence, awaiting colonisation by journalists. The Open Our Towpath campaign has blogged about its demo and you can see more photos of the scene here.\n\nYes, it was sort of chilling - a small but deadly earnest military presence appearing as if from nowhere to colonise and deprive. Some might find it reassuring but, either way, it's a stark reminder of terrorism anxiety and its habit of curtailing valued freedoms. On these occasions I try to put myself inside the shoes of those who'd get the blame should some atrocity occur - hands up who forgot to block the towpath - yet they also underline my determined view that the whole Games palaver had better be worth all the trouble in the end.\n\nRuth-Anna Macqueen, a junior doctor who co-organised Sunday's protest, recognises the need for precautionary measures, but wouldn't mind just a clue or two from the authorities about why this particular section of the park perimeter is being placed out of bounds. \"You can walk, drive or even live close to other parts of the fence,\" she says, and complains that Locog simply repeats a mantra about unspecified security reasons.\n\nShe also thinks the move was poorly planned. Ruth-Anna cycles daily from her home in Clapton (all the best people...) to work at Newham hospital, but having already lost access to the Greenway, which linked east Hackney to Stratford, she's not smitten with the official alternative route. Neither was the London Cycling Campaign (LCC), when it got wind of the arrangement back in March:\n\nWhereas the two mile towpath route is smooth, direct and traffic free the 3.2 mile diversion has over 40 turnings including a left and right turn on Bow road and the horrendous Hackney Wick motorway junction. The by-pass includes one section of estate roads where cyclists will have to dismount and push their cycles. Without very careful signage visitors are likely to be easily lost and confused.\n\nLCC added that in 2009 Games transport organisers were anticipating the towpath being a route to be promoted for cyclists and pedestrians during the Games. A new \"floating towpath\" and bridge across the river was constructed at the Bow end, but that too has now been placed out of bounds.\n\nRuth-Anna contends that preparations might have been better had Games authorities, \"Seen how many people use the towpath at 8.00 in the morning.\" She's not alone in remarking on the incongruity of the greatest sporting show in the world making it harder for people to run, walk and cycle past that show's main location (or indeed many other parts of London) for several weeks. A letter has been written to Boris Johnson, the \"cycling mayor,\" setting out the case against the closure and seeking his support.\n\nI don't think it will be forthcoming, but perhaps the campaign will concentrate the mayoral mind on ensuring that first-class walking and cycling facilities are truly part of the post-Games transport legacy. Further demonstrations are being planned.\n\nAs my runner's knees know, the pre-Games period has seen big improvements to the Lea towpath surface, not just near the Olympic Park but also by Lea Bridge to the north and still further to the stretch that flanks the Arriva bus garage between the Stonebridge and Picketts locks.\n\nContinued, sound investment will pay dividends in the long term and may make 2012's summer of sport towpath closure easier for irked local residents to forgive. The same principle might be usefully applied to the legacy promise as a whole.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/11/1342018329532/TowpathBlockAnon.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a663dbffc029897ed98d30fe0a2ac824", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Politics%2CLondon%2CLondon+politics%2CCycling%2CLondon+holidays%2CRivers%2CEnvironment%2CWalking+holidays%2CBoris+Johnson"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "11/07/2012"}, "rank_199": {"title": "Transport for London's 'keep away' message may leave an Olympic legacy | Annie Mole", "text": "If you live in London, you've probably heard Boris Johnson's booming voice on the tube and train networks, telling us that a million extra people will be pouring into the capital's transport system and that we shouldn't \"get caught out\" and to \"get ahead of the games\". Transport for London (TfL) is doing as much as it can to encourage us to use less of its service. Clearly having a public address system with Johnson's enthusiastic and excitable tones on permanent loop will do much to keep many Londoners off the Tube; it could be their secret weapon.\n\nThat and the continual messages reminding us just how dreadful the service is going to be seems to be TfL's modus operandi for the games. From November 2010 TfL and the Olympic Delivery Committee have been urging us not to use the tube during the Olympics \u2013 with the dire prediction that on the busiest days there would be an extra 3m journeys on the transport network, with a 30-minute wait to get on a tube train.\n\nFast forward two years and the reality of this \"don't use our service\" policy is in full force. There's a multitude of TfL posters encouraging us to work at home, get on a bike, walk, pole vault, travel on the roofs of cars, do anything but use the public transport system. We're being handed maps at mainline stations with \"handy\" walking distances to various locations. \"Walking is a great way to soak up the Games atmosphere and experience what is happening in and around the city\", the map helpfully advises. It might also be a great way to soak up the rain and a lot of sweat.\n\nBack in January, transport commissioner Peter Hendy tried a jokey tone by encouraging working Londoners to stay out late and \"enjoy the attractions of the South Bank\" or \"have a beer with a colleague\" in order to avoid facing a 30-minute wait for a tube between 5pm and 7pm throughout the Olympics. Some lines may be able to cope with this, as capacity has been increased on the tube's Jubilee and Central lines, the main lines carrying spectators to the Olympic park in Stratford, and about \u00a3125m has been spent on giving Stratford a much-needed facelift. Travellers can also use high-speed Javelin trains running between St Pancras and Stratford International stations, and to and from Watford Junction. But is this really enough to deal with the extra passengers?\n\nIn May 2012 TfL even turned to \"gamification\" to try to keep us off public transport. They teamed up with a company to produce Re:Route where walkers and cyclists earn points and money off products the more they walked or cycled. Although it appears that even cycling part of your journey might not be an option any more, as bicycles aren't allowed on the London Overground, Southeastern, Southern, Gatwick Connect and Heathrow Express services during the Games period. Also if you cycle in or even stop your bike in the Games Lanes you'll be subject to a \u00a3130 fine.\n\nNow with just a few weeks until the Olympics start come the transport rehearsals. \"Simulated queuing\" and other \"passenger diversions\" took place earlier this week as we were asked to test the transport system. Staff in fluorescent jackets were at major London stations waving passengers, who normally knew where they were going, through one-way systems and weird bottlenecks. This was putting our Olympic queuing skills to the ultimate test. Upbeat internal emails have been sent out by TfL inviting staff to take part in a \"tube crush test\", just to see how many people can physically be packed into a Central Line train.\n\nAll this goes to show that TfL is doing as much as it can to remind us that travelling on public transport during the Olympics is going to be far from pleasant and will be operating at its absolute limit, so why not just avoid it. But what will this policy have a longer term legacy on London's transport? Perhaps we will discover that we can live without it (and those pesky strike threats). Teleworking may increase, when employers discover that their staff can start work earlier and get a lot more done by working at home in their curlers without being stuck on a tube.\n\n\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/13/1342177272963/bikes-in-London-traffic-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ce69b854da5066312c1c7ecd4c464715", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CTransport%2CTransport+policy%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CSport%2CLondon%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/13/1342177272963/bikes-in-London-traffic-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=10460c23398ac34436e7ea62f01d3944"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/13/1342177272963/bikes-in-London-traffic-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ce69b854da5066312c1c7ecd4c464715", "date": "13/07/2012"}, "rank_122": {"title": "The White Building/ Lea River Park \u2013 review", "text": "Hackney Wick's offbeat White Building has all the hallmarks of a sensitive Olympic legacy, but the possible scrapping of the Lea River Park walkway suggests that petty politics not community is the driving force\n\nI'm looking at wool \u2013 lamb's wool from Wales \u2013 hung in billowing nets beneath the sloping ceiling of an old brick workshop, formerly a printer's works, before that a peppermint cream factory. Through the window is a view of the Dow-Chemicals-don't-mention-Bhopal wrapper going up on the Olympic Stadium. A few feet from the building, huge lumps of black and yellow steel have recently arrived, unannounced, along with military personnel, as part of the fortifications for the Olympic site. The steel looks as if it weighs more than the whole workshop.\n\nI'm in the White Building, a new cultural centre that includes studios where artists work and places to exhibit and hold events. It's run by Space, which provides studios all over east London, but adds a new dimension to its work in that the public can be invited in. A residency programme and a schools programme, both sponsored by Bloomberg, will bring in international artists on the one hand, and on the other introduce children to the usually hidden world of artistic production.\n\nIt sits by a canal, on the border between the Games zone and the still-shabby hinterland of Hackney Wick, where large off-message graffiti says of the London 2012 project, \"IMAGINE WAKING TOMORROW AND THIS SHIT HAD DISAPPEARED\". The canal is a thing of emerald weeds and dankness, whose calm is interrupted by freight trains barrelling over a nearby bridge. In due course this spot will be a major point of entry to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nThe project is funded by the London Legacy Development Corporation, which says it is a statement of intent about the hoped-for future direction of the Olympic legacy. It's conspicuously different from the major Olympic monuments which are mostly works of large international design practices built by the biggest contracting firms, using steel and concrete techniques that are essentially global, and which, following the guidelines of the International Olympic Committee, are only tangentially concerned with the pieces of earth they have landed on.\n\nThe White Building has been refurbished by contractors and fabricators from the immediate area, and makes spaces for many of the neighbourhood's artists. A local cafe is setting up a branch here, with an on-site brewery. It's almost agricultural, with hops as well as the wool. The building itself is the sort of place that could easily have been swept away in favour of stacks of luxury waterside urban living, which early masterplans for the Olympic site proposed should happen.\n\nThe decision to keep it asserts the value that apparently unexceptional buildings have for the area. Hackney Wick is a ragged but distinctive place, and without structures like this it would be almost nothing. The new chairman of the Legacy Corporation, Daniel Moylan, seems to have adopted the idea: \"Obliteration is not a word in our lexicon,\" he says. Previously, in building works around here, it was.\n\nThe project's architect, David Kohn, aims to be led by the existing building rather than impose himself on it. He leaves its skinny red trusses exposed and paints the much-marked floor black. I'm invited to admire the pink tone of the concrete blockwork in the cafe/bar, and some slight details that try to create a softer atmosphere, and indeed they do this well. The most notable move turns out to be the wool. It is a practical way of insulating the roof, introduces an unexpected softness into a hard environment, and does nice things to the acoustic. Natural, simple and slightly humorous, it's the opposite of the highly processed plastic that Dow are putting around the stadium.\n\nAll of which is appropriate and admirable and definitely a good way to proceed, even if it also seems somewhat fragile next to the well-funded juggernauts of sport and shopping nearby. It makes the possible cancellation of another project in the area, which shows similar principles of making the best of what is there, dismaying and baffling.\n\nThis is the Lea River Park, designed by architects 5th Studio, a project that will enable people to walk from the Thames to the Olympic Park. It will use bridges and other means to link various bits of open space and water into a three-mile-long linear park, called \"the Fatwalk\". It will create water meadows and new hills made of spoil from building the Crossrail underground line. It's a serious and obviously good idea, first proposed by Lord Abercrombie's Greater London Plan of 1944. It will connect places up. It will create new open space in an area that badly needs it. It will add value to new developments.\n\nIt will help make sense of one of the mayor of London's favourite projects, the cross-Thames cable car known as the Emirates Air Line, as it will continue its path of movement northwards. It has been designed, consulted upon and granted permission, and contracts have been signed and land acquired. It was part of \"London's Great Outdoors\", which is \"the Mayor's ambitious programme to transform the public places we live in\". A few million in public money and five years of work have been spent getting it this far.\n\nYet it's in danger of foundering for the boring technical reason that responsibility for it has been transferred from the wound-down London Thames Gateway Development Corporation to the Greater London Authority, and that the latter's support is now needed to complete legal work, which for some reason they don't seem particularly keen to give. In which case the whole project will unravel, collapse and be impossible to resuscitate. Nothing similar will be attempted in the foreseeable future.\n\nPerhaps this risk of foundering is to do with some petty turf war, because its new proprietors don't feel the Lea River Park is their project. Perhaps the mayor would rather put his energies into another eye-catching, sponsor-friendly, not particularly useful idea, such as the Orbit or the Air Line.\n\nWhatever is true, none of these would be good enough reasons for the waste of money and effort in abandoning something of direct benefit to the impoverished districts whose betterment is so often invoked as the reason for holding the Olympics. It would also make the good intentions of the White Building seem tokenistic in the extreme \u2013 as if no one in authority really did much care what happened to the battered places around the shiny Olympic Park.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/01/23/Rowan_Moore,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=280070523cc8d66b01c807a52545943f", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Architecture%2CDesign%2CArt+and+design%2CCulture%2COlympic+legacy%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/7/12/1342110205522/Local-colour-the-White-Bu-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e2579d8d5ca95d7e0045f041da598e0", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/7/12/1342110205522/Local-colour-the-White-Bu-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=acc2ba7ac8befe62c7fc4246b8b7f7a3"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/7/12/1342110205522/Local-colour-the-White-Bu-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=acc2ba7ac8befe62c7fc4246b8b7f7a3", "date": "14/07/2012"}, "rank_100": {"title": "London 2012: Despite our anxieties, the Olympics will be a force for good in Britain | Observer editorial", "text": "In February this year, a team from the International Olympic Committee made their tenth and final visit to inspect and assess preparations for the 2012 \"Games of the XXX Olympiad\" due to begin in 12 days. The Games will embrace 26 sports in 34 venues across the country, involving more than 16,000 athletes watched by 11 million spectators and billions more around the globe. The cost to the public purse has risen over seven years from \u00a32.5bn to more than \u00a39bn. The IOC's verdict is that it is money well spent. \"London is ready to host the world,\" it declared boldly.\n\nEvents over the past week or so have injected more than a modicum of doubt into that enthusiastic assertion \u2013 while raising questions about a lack of political leadership. A series of crises have occurred that appear all the more alarming both because of their proximity to the Games' opening on 27 July and also, perversely, because the previous seven years of planning and delivery, under the stewardship of Lord Coe, have gone mostly smoothly.\n\nFirst, a crack in a flyover on the M4 risked putting London's most important Olympic route in jeopardy. Then, the ongoing issue of inadequate immigration staffing at Heathrow resulted in the public relations disaster of arrival lounges packed with visitors queueing for up to two hours and no staff in sight despite a ministerial promise that this would not happen. Most disturbingly, and still ongoing, is the security fiasco caused by the mismanagement of the international company G4S in failing to meet its target of providing up to 17,500 guards for the Olympic Park. As a result, 3,500 military personnel have had to be shipped in, many facing redundancy and forfeiting well-earned holidays, as well as extra police reinforcements. Ian Swales, of the House of Commons public accounts committee, has criticised G4S for charging \"colossal fees\" for \"very poor service\". On Tuesday the G4S chief executive, Nick Buckles, explains the company's latest public sector calamity (it lost its contract to deport refused migrants last year after one death and 773 complaints of abuse) to the home affairs select committee.\n\nBoris Johnson, mayor of London, has told us glibly this is a case of \"pre-curtain jitters\" before the \"very safe, very secure\" Games begin. He is almost certainly correct, but what was needed was not flippant Boris-lite but a strong ministerial reminder of the uplifting mission and potential long-term rewards of London 2012. Jeremy Hunt, the Olympics minister, has been in purdah since his appearance at the Leveson inquiry and David Cameron, perhaps wishing to distance himself from yet another potential shambles, has conspicuously failed to fill the political void. Well, at a time when the eyes of the world are on London, someone needs to.\n\nThe prime minister could still rise to the occasion and give a clear explanation for the \"jitters\" and, as importantly, provide a spirited narrative about the world-class athleticism and human endeavour to come. He could pause to praise the admirable response of more than 70,000 volunteers (\"big society\", anyone?) and the fortitude of the local East End community, disrupted for the past seven years. He could remind us that Britain has faultlessly delivered world-class stadiums on what was a toxic industrial wasteland. He could talk of the hope we all have that this redevelopment will help regenerate one of the poorest parts of Britain. Instead, what we have this weekend are reminders to the public of the cost of the Games and the potential vulnerability of the host city.\n\nCritics remain convinced that the London Olympics is worth its weight in gold, but only if you count the bounty that will accrue to the corporate sponsors \u2013 among them McDonald's and Coca-Cola, whose brazen appearance in the Olympic Park seems, at best, incongruous.\n\nThe commercialisation of the Games is not of London's making \u2013 it's a pact that any bidding city signs up for. The IOC insists that the candidate cities must sign a contract, described as an \"epic masterpiece in micro-management\". It stipulates IOC transportation in exclusive \"Zil\" traffic lanes in 500 air-conditioned chauffeured limousines and accommodation in 1,800 four- and five-star hotel rooms. It also demands that the Olympics are a tax-free haven so the 18 Olympic partners won't have to pay \u00a3600m tax on the \u00a32.5bn they are expected to harvest.\n\nWhat the contract does not do is confront the IOC's continued association with corruption. Last month, for example, 27 Olympic officials and agents were caught selling tickets for London 2012 on the black market.\n\nCritics also voice concerns that the public money invested in the monumental regeneration of the East End (75p in every \u00a31 spent by the Olympic development authority) will benefit the already affluent, with jobs going to outsiders and housing beyond the price of locals. In addition, although the Games are sited across Britain, many non-Londoners view them as a purely capital city bonanza. In a BBC poll last week, 74% said the rest of the UK would not benefit and 59% thought the taxpayer had footed too large a bill.\n\nAdd to that cavalcade of criticism the daily thrum of unrelenting rain and the appalling neglect of school sports (a squandered Olympic legacy) and it might appear that there are very few reasons to be cheerful about London 2012.\n\nThe Observer disagrees.\n\nOf course there are caveats, including profound concerns about security; the IOC's \"vanity\" modus operandi; excessive commercialisation and inequities such as highly restricted ticketing that has locked out many ordinary people. But, uncharacteristically in Britain, let's look at the upsides.\n\nThe planning and execution of the London Olympics, delivering impressive transport connections, including the high-speed rail from King's Cross to Stratford. Completing infrastructure on time and \u00a31bn under the adjusted budget. And, most importantly, the longer-term, meticulously planned legacy transforming an area that has suffered decades of shameful neglect. All these add up to an achievement of which Britain has a right to be proud.\n\nAnd that is even before the Games commence, bringing with them a potential tally of medals accrued by our many young athletes, among them 15-year-old Rebecca Tunney, Tom Daley and Jessica Ennis. Over the past several months they have done so much to rebalance the almost wholly negative media coverage of youth. So, hopefully, we are on the threshold of a much needed 17-day holiday in optimism for Britain, an historic event that has its roots seven years ago in the quality of Britain's original bid and a promise \"to inspire a generation\".\n\nIn Singapore, in 2005, Team GB included 30 children from London's East End; David Beckham, Ken Livingstone, then mayor of London, and a typically crowd-pleasing performance from Tony Blair. London stole victory from the favourite, Paris, by only four votes. Lord Coe, two times gold medal winner, said he had won \"the biggest prize in sport\". Tessa Jowell, then minister for culture, media and sport, deserves credit as the godmother of London 2012. Against almost total cabinet opposition, and the professional judgment of economists she hired to conduct a feasibility study, Jowell persevered, allied with Ken Livingstone. Both believed that the Olympics could deliver to the highly deprived boroughs of Newham, Tower Hamlets, Waltham Forest, Hackney, Greenwich and Barking and Dagenham, \"60 years of regeneration in six\".\n\nThe 200-hectare site designated as the Olympic Park had the equivalent of 10 football pitches of Japanese knotweed; acres of fly-tipping; landfill and contaminated soil. The Queen visited in 2005 and viewed a mini-mountain of discarded fridges where the Velodrome is now sited. It is telling that while G4S has been handed bags full of public money without apparent scrutiny, targets or penalties, in contrast the Olympic development authority (ODA) has been transparent on goals, challenges and delivery. In the process it has created local jobs, training and apprenticeships.\n\nContracts have also been spread across the UK. Every public pound has worked hard trying to retain a senior partnership with private investment. While new techniques have been pioneered, from burying pylons to washing 2m tons of toxic soil to recycling and design, this is a remarkable story that has yet to be fully told. At London 2012, for the first time in Olympic history, the legacy plans were initiated three years before the Games began. That is a powerful blueprint for future Games.\n\nCould more have been done for the East End community? Undoubtedly, but there are the next 30 years to make that good. The Observer would like to see an independent watchdog with clout established to ensure that this is the case. \"Convergence\" is a plan to improve a range of issues in the six boroughs \u2013 for instance, in education, employment, poverty and health \u2013 and bring standards up to the level of the rest of London. In July next year the Olympic site will reopen as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Six of the eight permanent venues are secure. The stadium goes out to tender again in the autumn; on Tuesday, it is likely that its agreed the press and broadcast centre will become home to iCity, a digital university, enterprise hub, broadcaster and provider of the first digital apprenticeship scheme.\n\nEffort has been made in regeneration to treasure the past, not ensure its obliteration. Over the next three decades, 11,000 new homes (35% \"affordable\" housing) will be built. Homes, not high-rise apartments. Homes with gardens built into a new living community in the Park. All of these are reasons to cheer.\n\nTwelve days hence we shall judge whether the imaginative appointments of Danny Boyle and Stephen Daldry will produce a multimillion pound opening ceremony that sets a benchmark for creativity. London 2012 has already proved that, for a tiny island with a population of 60 million or so, we are far from slow off the blocks. Last week the ODA published its final report. In The Finishing Straight, Sir John Armitt wrote: \"At every turn since 2005, the UK has proved that it can compete with the best, win, deliver and do what is promised.\"\n\nLet the Games begin.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSebastian+Coe%2CKen+Livingstone%2CBoris+Johnson%2CG4S%2CInternational+Olympic+Committee%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "14/07/2012"}, "rank_99": {"title": "Lea River Park: linking the Thames to the Olympic Park \u2013 in pictures", "text": "A view of the proposed site of the Lea River Park, a long-planned project to build a path connecting the Thames to east London's Olympic Park, which is faltering.

To me it looks breathtaking. To Des Smith, head gardener for 2012 gardens, it is a problem. \"There's been so much rain recently,\" he said on a rare sunny day in mid-Junel, \"that we haven't been able to get in here for a month.\"\n\nSince 2008, plant specialists Nigel Dunnett and James Hitchmough from Sheffield University, Sarah Price, the Hampton Court gold medallist and Chelsea silver medallist, and Smith have been counting down to the opening ceremony. In the process they have been playing God, by holding back some plants and forcing others so that when the Olympic Games begin on 27 July, each one is looking at its best.\n\nAbout a year ago, Hitchmough did have his doubts about whether everything would be ready in time. \"Several areas of building work on the site were running behind schedule, so we got access later than planned,\" he says, \"and I did have a few weeks of sleepless nights. But we have now tested everything. We know it's all going to work.\"\n\nFor the rather too lush European garden, this means a big haircut to ensure the grasses, leucanthemum and yellow scabious are even denser and bushier than they are now; for the steeply-inclined meadow beside the Olympic stadium which still looks suspiciously like brown earth, this means that everything is on track; come late July, it will be a wall of blue cornflowers. If building an Olympic complex on a contaminated industrial site was tricky enough, then creating the largest new urban park \u2013 250 acres of parkland, wetland, meadows and gardens \u2013 in the UK for more than a century was a logistical nightmare.\n\nEvery cubic metre of the original soil had to be removed and replaced with a specially designed mixture of stone, crushed rock and green composted waste. For every \u00a3100 spent on the 4,000 semi-mature trees that have been planted on the site, another \u00a3300 was spent on what lay underneath them.\n\nAt the heart of the new park are the four 2012 gardens \u2013 European, American, Southern Hemisphere and Asian, designed to celebrate both the British passion for gardening and for nicking plants from overseas \u2013 that line the river by the main entrance to the park from Stratford, and the Great British Garden, designed by Rachel Read and Hannah Clegg, the two adult and child winners of the Royal Horticultural Society's open competition, with a guiding hand from Price.\n\nBut for those who want to get away from the crowds and the fast food concessions, the impressive wetlands \u2013 landscaped to be the focus of a natural amphitheatre \u2013 that lie to the north of the park may prove just as attractive.\n\nNot that anywhere will be off-limits. The lawns are there for people to walk on, the plants are there to be enjoyed up close and the trees are there to be climbed. After a test event for children in the Great British Garden, Smith and his team spent half an hour fishing hula-hoops out the pond. \"Bless them,\" he smiles. \"I love them all.\"\n\nAdults, children and dogs won't be the only ones in the park; like most things Olympic, sustainability is part of the project and if you look carefully you can find wildlife everywhere, from kingfishers in the wetlands to the hedges topped with spiders' webs.\n\n\"Our aim was always to wow people with the planting rather than go on and on about how good this or that was for the environment,\" says Hitchmough. \"Hopefully we've done that. But I still think it's cool there are more than a billion pollinators on the site.\"\n\nIt's Smith's job to maintain the balance between humans, plants and wildlife. Once the opening ceremony is over his main task will be to ensure that the gardens look at their best for the rest of the Games.\n\n\"There's going to be a lot of night shifts for me and my team of 22,\" he says. \"We don't know how people are going to use the park, but we hope they will treat it kindly. We've kept detailed notes of everything we've done over the past few years \u2013 the Olympic Development Authority always wants to know where the money has gone \u2013 so we should be able to cope with any situation.\" And after the Games? \"I'm not really meant to say as officially the park gets handed over to the Legacy company \u2026\" he continues.\n\n\"OK,\" I say, \"How about we assume, for the sake of argument,the Legacy company asks you to carry on running the park?\"\n\n\"Then it would be brilliant. This may have the feel of a Chelsea show garden, where everything has been grown to be at its best for the same limited period of time, but it really isn't. After the Games, everything will be allowed to flower at its natural time of year. I've been a gardener for 35 years and I'd always previously worked on private estates because most municipal gardens are a bit crap. But this park is absolutely stunning.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/2/1341253196229/Olympic-Parks-European-ga-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37a8b5045faa9b71f5397cdd89c95572", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/John-Crace,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=49ecc164b105ef1ee46a4ad8014adf25", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/2/1341253196229/Olympic-Parks-European-ga-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=51fa1b51b7c8a45abedafd066c4bbe8b", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport%2CGardens%2CLife+and+style%2CLondon%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/2/1341253196229/Olympic-Parks-European-ga-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37a8b5045faa9b71f5397cdd89c95572", "date": "16/07/2012"}, "rank_203": {"title": "London 2012: Sir Steve Redgrave visits Newham to see the Olympic legacy in action - video", "text": "Five-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Steve Redgrave visits Newham in east London, to see community sports projects that have secured lottery funding from the Olympics legacy fund.

Then there are the London 2012 'tier one' partners, such as Adidas, BT and BMW, who each pay around \u00a340m - there are seven of these. That's followed by another seven \"supporters\" who pay \u00a320m and then 28 \"suppliers\" who pay around \u00a310m\n\nMeanwhile, we report today that some of the sponsors are coming under pressure over their tax breaks:\n\n\n\nVisa is coming under increasing pressure to publicly waive tax breaks handed to major Olympic sponsors after two of the biggest backers of the Games promised to pay the UK Exchequer. McDonald's and Coca Cola both said yesterday that they would decline relief handed to the 11 \"worldwide\" sponsors of the Games, meaning that the profits made from selling burgers and fizzy drinks to spectators in the Olympic park will now be taxed\n\nThe row over Olympic taxes comes against a backdrop of the bill for London 2012 being funded by around \u00a31bn of sponsorship, which includes \u00a3700m raised locally by the organising committee and a further \u00a3700m contribution from sponsorship and broadcast revenues from the IOC.\n\nInterestingly, it might not even be that effective for most of the sponsors. Brand Republic reported recently that many people have no idea who's sponsoring the Olympics - for instance, 16% of those surveyed think Tesco's is a sponsor, which it's not. Similarly, Canon, Carlsberg, Sky and mobile phone company Orange were all erroneously cited as sponsors.\n\nHave we got the numbers right?

But developing a community from scratch is not easy\n\nThe end of the London 2012 Olympic Games will mark a new beginning for swaths of east London. More than 6,000 local people will move into the 2,818 homes that today make up the athletes village, as its legacy as Stratford's East Village takes shape.\n\nTriathlon Homes will take over ownership of 1,379 homes on the site, which includes 675 properties for social rent, but also houses to be let at intermediate rent, and sold to home owners through shared-ownership and shared-equity schemes. The remaining 1,439 homes will be available on the private market, but predominantly for rent rather than outright sale.\n\nWith a good number of family-sized homes, the East Village will provide much-needed affordable housing for east Londoners and, for many, this will be the true Olympic legacy. But creating a thriving sustainable community from scratch \u2013 especially across such a range of tenures and tenant needs \u2013 is an unprecedented challenge.\n\nTraditional villages and communities develop organically over many years, but we have worked hard to establish the foundations for a thriving and ultimately self-sustaining community in what is a relatively short time.\n\nIt is crucial that East Village's residents encompass as broad a range of lifestyles, family sizes and life stages as possible. But that poses its own problems; we must, for example, ensure that the 1,800-pupil Chobham Academy School is appropriate for families' needs while developing local healthcare facilities that are well used, but not overloaded.\n\nThe first step is to act early. Although the keys for the village will not be handed over until the summer of 2013, we will begin the allocation process for 675 social-rented homes later this year \u2013 months before any residents move in. This will allow us to start building a relationship with residents and understand their needs. The allocation process takes into account many factors to help secure a balanced mix of residents. It aims to recognise the housing needs of those in work, or wishing to enter work, and we will also provide relevant employment training and guidance for residents.\n\nAs the Greater London Authority will also receive a share of the homes, we expect residents from across the capital to move to Stratford. This is a physical manifestation of the city's centre of gravity tilting eastwards, with Londoners from all quarters of the city able to reap the benefits of the Olympics.\n\nWe hope our vision for the future of Stratford is reflected in the high standards of quality and design on the site. It will be near impossible to discern which homes belong to private renters, and which are allocated for affordable or social housing. All residents will have equal access to local health, education and sporting facilities, as well as community groups and public services.\n\nThe real test for East Village, however, is when its 6,000 new residents move in next year. We want to ensure that it remains a pleasant and desirable place to live. We do not want a management strategy that is overbearing or interfering for the community, but we will offer special support: concierges who can also carry out bike repairs; trustworthy delivery services; common areas maintained to the highest standard.\n\nAbove all, and just like the design of the village, our management strategy will be tenure-blind. The Olympic Games will offer London so many opportunities, but few are as long-lasting or as necessary as the thousands of new homes it will provide in a regeneration area of the capital.\n\nDale Meredith is executive director of Triathlon Homes, a joint venture established by First Base, East Thames Group and Southern Housing Group\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

While there are already signs of progress in areas such as antenatal care and infant health, high proportions of five-year-olds are obese and only just over half are ready for school\n\nHere are some of the key facts:\n\n\u2022 In four of the six boroughs, six to 12-year-olds are less physically active than elsewhere in London\n\n\u2022 A higher number of 13 to 18-year-olds in Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest smoke than the average for London\n\n\u2022 Young people in Newham and Waltham Forest have more first-time court appearances\n\n\u2022 Just over half of all school leavers in the boroughs \u2013 the others are Hackney, Newham, and Barking and Dagenham \u2013 achieve five GCSEs, significantly worse than the London average\n\n\u2022 Teenagers are less likely to be in education, employment or training. By the age of 18, the conception rate in all boroughs bar Tower Hamlets is above the capital's average\n\nThe issue is important: more than a quarter of the population of the boroughs is under 20. Three-quarters of five to 16-year-olds are from black or ethnic minority backgrounds and the proportion living in poverty ranges from a third in Greenwich and Waltham Forest to more than half in Tower Hamlets. The London average is just under 30%.\n\nThe report builds off the back of the early years' evidence from the Marmot Review of Health Inequalities in England: Fair society, healthy lives. Its aim is to \"give every child the best start in life and enable children, young people and adults to maximise their potential.\"\n\nThe full data from the report is below - including data showing which boroughs have improved the most.

Photograph: Dave Hill\n\nResidents of Wick Village in the Hackney Wick area of east Hackney, can look across the River Lea Navigation Canal from the walkway along the side of it and see the blank face of the Olympic Park press centre looking back. It didn't used to be that way. Before the vast 2012 land clearance began their view was of a green space known as Arena Fields, which lay just to the south of the legendary Hackney Marshes.\n\nThen came years of construction work, bringing with it noise, dust, inconvenience and some distress to the village and other residential areas nearby. The consolation, say Wick Villagers Dee O'Connell and Ian White, was a promise by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) that the walkway and a grassy, tree-lined continuation of it that runs behind the playground wall of neighbouring Gainsborough primary school would be improved for communal benefit.\n\nThe little stretch behind the school is of particular importance to the residents, not all of whom have gardens. A secure future of secluded waterfront barbecues was envisaged, restoring the space for the use it was put to until around 2010 when vandals damaged the lighting, making the space unsafe. But Dee, Ian and, it seems, many of their neighbours fear that the walkway and erstwhile barbecue spot will instead become a public thoroughfare serving one end of a footbridge that would span the canal and provide public access to the post-Games park.\n\nWhat we have here is a hyperlocal tale that illuminates larger issues about the benefits or otherwise to local communities of the Olympic Park's development in the years to come, and how those issues are managed by the powers that be.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. There's a strong argument for building a bridge. The catering building serving the press centre and the much larger broadcast centre behind it will be demolished after the Games to make way for new playing fields for the fast-expanding Gainsborough school, and these would eventually be shared with a new school on the park side of the canal serving one of the park's eventual new neighbourhoods. The bridge would replace one that had previously connected the school to the opposite bank, until it fell into disrepair and was demolished four years ago.\n\nThe Wick Village objectors recognise this need for the bridge, but think it should terminate within Gainsborough school's playground - as the old one did - and be for pupils' use alone. It's the possibility of general public access that worries them. Dee and Ian are young, relative newcomers but say that many fellow residents who've lived there since Wick Village was built in the early 1990s - and in some cases in the tower blocks it replaced - are elderly, frail and worried that their quiet niche will become a place that droves of park visitors pass through or, worse, that antisocial elements hang about in.\n\nThere's a complicated backstory here. The original planning application for a new bridge was approved in 2007, under the first Olympic Park masterplan. It was drawn up with Gainsborough school's needs principally in mind, but included a provision for the bridge to possibly become accessible to the general public at a later date.\n\nThe London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), now the planning authority for the park and some surrounding areas, explains that it has inherited this planning permission and is legally obliged to abide by it. However, it stresses that this doesn't mean that the bridge will be accessible to the public straight away or indeed ever, only that consideration of \"how public access could be facilitated in the future,\" would be included in the determination of the application its has submitted to the ODA jointly with Hackney Council. It adds that there would be consultation with residents if and when the process of making the bridge accessible to the public went ahead.\n\nBut this doesn't meet the objectors' fears. They say that not only would the possibility of full public access remain but that designing the bridge in a way that would allow for this in the future would cause them a separate problem by intruding on the barbecue area. An access ramp would be installed along the outside wall of the playground they say, taking up a wide strip of the space and requiring the removal of the trees along that side of it.\n\nAnother twist in the dispute is that some of the original residents say that the barbecue area was bought from British Waterways at the time of Wick Village's birth by the tenant management organisation, which is responsible for some aspects of its running, including repairing it and keeping it clean. However, no formal records of such a purchase seem to exist.\n\nHackney Council applied successfully for \"adverse possession\" of the land in 2010 (under the same legislation that grants rights to squatters). I understand that it and LLDC consider that they've minimised the space the access ramp would take up and would undertake to re-position or replace the existing barbecue facilities, plants and seating as well as instal a railing on the canal side to make it safer for people using the area.\n\nA public access bridge is also included in Hackney's planning policy for the area, the Hackney Wick area action plan and there have been public consultations on that. But whatever the pros and cons of the actual proposals, an underlying problem of trust seems to remain. Dee and Ian say there's a feeling among residents that the ODA and Hackney Council haven't always made clear enough to what the implications of the bridge for Wick Village might be, and are now not being as helpful as they should.\n\nAt least 34 of Wick Village's 120 households have sent off written objections to the proposals, which have been submitted for determination to the relevant committees of the ODA and Hackney Council on, respectively, 23 July and 12 September. This is not at all the situation they thought they'd up in back when thought something would be done to make up for all the disruption and change that has occurred.\n\nA closing thought. This might be a very small, very local Olympics legacy story, but, whatever has gone before, the authorities should do all in their power to bring about an ending to it that leaves local people as happy as possible. That, after all, is what legacy is meant to do, and not only in Wick Village.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Society%2CLocal+government%2CLocal+politics%2CLondon%2CPolitics%2CLondon+politics%2CPlanning+policy%2CRegeneration", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/20/1342740861200/BBQCrop.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e897765b40d8d8dcdf878f062c99ba37"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "19/07/2012"}, "rank_220": {"title": "Live discussion: regeneration and the London 2012 Olympics", "text": "Join our panel of experts from 12pm on Monday 23 July to discuss what makes a successful scheme project and what we can hope for from the Olympic legacy\n\nMore than 11,000 new homes will be built on the site of the Olympic Park in what London mayor Boris Johnson has described as \"the most important regeneration project for the next 25 years\".\n\nThe 202-hectare (500-acre) site will be handed over to the London Legacy Development Corporation after the Games and work will begin work on the area's transformation.

Share your thoughts in the comments thread\n\nDuncan Innes is executive director of real estate at the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC)\n\nFamily housing: A key issue, certainly for the Olympic Park itself, is to provide family homes and the social infrastructure (such as schools) that goes with them. We see families and the balanced, stable communities they tend to create as a key building block of our regeneration strategy.\n\nAffordability: For the affordable homes there will be a range of rent levels. Certainly not all of them will be at 80% of market rent.\n\nDave Smith is a community organiser for Citizens UK\n\nReintegration: In many ways, I think it is a question of how quickly and ably the LLDC, Newham council and local residents in Leyton and Stratford are able to reconnect with a piece of neighbourhood which has been shut off from their immediate doorstep for a long time. I'd argue that folk currently living in the areas immediately bordering the park will be the ultimate test for the legacy. Will it be something they feel they own and can afford to engage with? Or a new piece of city for a new clientele?\n\nRethinking prejudices: It is too easy to be immediately prejudicial towards large-scale regeneration efforts and unfair, in the case of this one, to presume that local people and municipal bodies necessarily want different things.\n\nCompromises: What does make people despondent is the feeling of disenfranchisement when their interests are, as they must be from time to time, weighed up against wider financial needs.\n\nLet's be upfront about the term 'affordable': In east London, 80% of the market rate is not affordable. And paradoxically it becomes even less affordable if the rest of the scheme is a \"success\" and house prices go up. Now if we were to base affordable lets and for-sale homes on people's incomes, rather than a proportion of the market rate, wouldn't that be something unique for London 2012 to be proud of?\n\nConor McAuley is executive member for regeneration and strategic planning at Newham council\n\nFamily housing has not been forgotten: 40% of the homes planned in the legacy communities scheme are intended for families. But if left just to the market, family housing will not be built. This government's desire to simplify the planning system must not be allowed to sweep away the planning policies that are designed to meet local housing needs. Its really is not just about housing numbers, its about family housing and sustainable communities too.\n\nCollaboration is crucial: The success of the East Village post-games will really depend upon some serious joined-up working involving the council, the landlords, Triathlon Homes and Delancy, the Chobham Academy, the NHS and the LLDC. This is placemaking on a scale not attempted since the era of the post war new towns. Except this is in the middle of London, so the local links to the existing communities and networks will be crucial.\n\nHousing is crucial, but people also need jobs: The temptation to see the regeneration of east London simply in terms of the number and type of new homes needed, plus the required social infrastructure such as schools and doctors, really must be resisted.\n\nUnderstanding the needs of the employers: Over the years, Newham council has been frustrated in the failure of successive regeneration programmes to successfully link local people to the new jobs. Five years age we created Workplace, our own council-funded job brokerage. In the last 12 months, 5,000 Newham residents have obtained employment with more than 2,000 obtaining full time employment at the new Westfield shopping centre.\n\nOlaide Oyekanmi is head of sales and marketing at Triathlon Homes\n\nUsing social media: We have already started this with the East Village Facebook page, Twitter and the London Living blog. We also intend to develop an online community for residents before they move in. We believe that this will help to develop relationships and ideas that can be delivered within the east village community once they move in.\n\nDavid Adamson is chief executive of the Centre for Regeneration Excellence in Wales\n\nPostcode inequality: One of the problems with past regeneration schemes has been rigid boundaries creating postcode inequalities. Permeable boundaries encourage organic development and integrate older communities with new developments.\n\nMark Dutton is head of regeneration at the Vela Group\n\nQualitative outcomes: It's important to capture and recognise the true and lasting value of qualitative outcomes around the local sense of place. What do the people living there feel about it? How has life changed for them? What has happened to local aspirations and external perceptions of the area? What about increased opportunities?\n\nCaroline Field is regeneration manager for Orbit Homes\n\nCommunity integration: We need to make sure that we not focused on building a stand alone community among new residents but forging links with the surrounding communities too. This ensures that the benefits are spread to surrounding areas as well as letting existing community infrastructure creep into the new development. It's much easier to invite in existing community groups and encourage them to expand than it is to start them up from scratch.\n\nLocal involvement: One way of building links with surrounding communities is to have some of the people with established local links moving into the new neighbourhood. Sometimes these are people looking to move into home ownership or trade up and still keep their local links, and there have often not been opportunities to buy what they want locally before the regeneration.\n\nAnabel Palmer is director of social and economic regeneration at Southern Housing Group\n\nBridging new and old communities: The current housing element of the scheme is part of a much wider offer to the local area: great new sports facilities, a new park, new school and health facilities. These will all be accessible to local communities and will be a hub for the new community as well as a bridge between new and existing communities.\n\nYou can catch up with the discussion in full here\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Potential appointments come and go until, on the Monday afternoon before the Olympics, Franglen sends me a last-minute text. Can I come to a station in London's Docklands for 11 o'clock at night? I'm advised to wear boots and dark clothing that I don't mind being ripped.\n\nThe reason for all this subterfuge is the venue: a derelict, partially demolished factory that serves as a document to Docklands' industrial past. It is dangerous and guarded at the best of times, let alone during the Olympic build-up.\n\nFranglen first came here four years ago with some urban explorers, intrepid types who infiltrate parts of the city that are abandoned and off-limits. The phrase was coined in 1996 and the internet has since enabled a worldwide network of urban explorers to swap stories, photographs and advice. In January, Franglen decided that the building would be the perfect venue for an idea that had germinated two months earlier, when he was asked to design a piece of sound art for the British Business Embassy, a networking initiative, and felt that he had caught a glimpse of \"the beast behind the Olympics\".\n\n\"I've always liked the Olympics,\" he says, \"but when you've got Jeremy Hunt saying we've decided not to have an austerity Olympics, we mustn't hold back, when we're cutting the School Sports Initiative, that's an interesting conundrum. Legacy is a ghastly word. Politicians talk about the legacy of the games to east London and I think what they're concerned about is what their legacy will be. Does east London benefit from all this regeneration or is it negative to have this completely alien infrastructure dropped into it and its heritage stripped out? I was trying to ask a question: what sort of Olympics do we really want? Why does it have to be like this?\"\n\nFranglen is a big, garrulous man but clearly has a steely, obsessive streak. Born in north London, he is best-known as half of chill-out duo Lemon Jelly and producer of albums by John Cale and Badly Drawn Boy. In recent years, however, his projects have become more unorthodox. With his band Blacksand, he has played gigs in such unlikely venues as a mine, a submarine and Pyestock, the former Concorde test centre in Hampshire, beloved of urban explorers. He has also played 24-hour solo theremin concerts beneath Manhattan Bridge and London Bridge.\n\nLegacy, however, is his most ambitious and taxing endeavour yet. He had initially hoped to conclude the installation by watching the opening ceremony fireworks from the building's roof but he has heard rumours that snipers will be stationed there during the games. \"I don't mind playing cat-and-mouse with security but I don't want to interfere with people doing a serious job,\" he says. Also, he adds, \"I don't want to be shot.\"\n\nIt's a warm, clear night. We rendezvous in the street and make our way through the outer layer of security. He can never be entirely sure he will get in. \"When I approach here my stomach's churning,\" he admits. \"I'm white with fear.\"\n\nUp close, the building's hulk looms vast and ghostly. Watching out for security patrols, we negotiate a series of fences and enter through a concealed opening. Inside, it is a disaster area. Several floors are gone. Those that remain are Swiss-cheesed with holes where machinery has been removed, covered by rotting boards too flimsy to support anybody's weight. A powerful torch might attract attention so we proceed using only the dim light coming through the broken windows. I follow Franglen's whispered advice: keep close to this wall, mind that loose step, watch out for that 20-foot plunge. \"This is not a building to fall over in,\" he says. \"It's a shocker. You could fall and kill yourself, of course, but worse than that you could break your leg in the basement where you can't get a phone signal and no one would ever find you. The first time I came here on my own I found that terrifying, but I feel that this is my domain now. I doubt anyone knows this place as well as I do.\"\n\nTo safely enter the section that houses Legacy you have to climb a ladder across a dizzying drop and scoot across a stretch of scrub that's in full view of a mysterious black dirigible that stealthily patrols the waterfront at unpredictable intervals. Finally, there is the so-called \"Leap of Faith\". Not, as a rule, having much faith in leaping, I'm relieved to find that it's actually another ladder. \"It doesn't live up to its name,\" agrees Franglen as he clambers down onto the concrete floor. \"I call it the Pace of Disappointment.\"\n\nThe building has a pungent, mushroomy aroma and a series of metal staircases and ladders that make our ascent feel reminiscent of a game of Donkey Kong. One room has no outside wall, so it is plastered with guano and noisy with the sound of pigeons' wings. Another is carpeted with hundreds of tangled cables. Franglen points to two industrial fans. \"They didn't used to be that close together. Sometimes you notice people have moved things.\" Urban explorers endeavour to leave minimal trace \u2013 they are trespassers, not vandals or burglars \u2013 but Franglen has been here often enough to notice the small things. Like many old buildings, it makes strange noises, as if turning in its sleep and muttering to itself. When you're not supposed to be there, these noises can sound uncannily like footsteps.\n\nEventually we reach the seventh floor, which houses Legacy 1. It's a small garden containing rows of lettuce, spinach, spring onions and radishes, watered by the rain seeping through a hole in the roof. Franglen obtained the seeds from a friend who used to have a plot on the Manor Gardens allotments before they were destroyed to make way for the Olympic Park. That was the easy bit. He used to have to enter the site through a hole in the perimeter fence, and heft sacks of compost across several hundred yards of scrubland. One night he had to climb a tree with two sacks and hide there for four hours. \"I used to pray for rain because it meant [the security guard] would stay in his car but, remarkably, it's always been a night like this.\"\n\nIn another room we find Legacy 3: a battery-powered television screening a DVD of the opening ceremony of the Athens Olympics. Franglen intended to contrast the triumphal spectacle with the fact that 21 of the 22 venues built for the games now lie empty. \"All these buildings in Athens are derelict and guarded and you're in a derelict, guarded building,\" he explains. He turns on the TV. In the gloom and hush it seems deafeningly loud and bright, so he quickly clicks it off again.\n\nLegacy 2 is a low roof filled with shallow water, which Franglen has transformed into a miniature boating lake. He smuggled in 205 solar-powered toy rowing boats \u2013 one for each nation competing in the Olympics \u2013 and, after much trial and error, successfully waterproofed them. \"Sainsbury's sandwich bags,\" he says, proudly holding one up.\n\nWe climb another ladder on to the upper roof and I'm suddenly aware that the building is an island of darkness amid a sea of electric light. Behind us lies City airport; to our left the gleaming shells of the Thames barrier; ahead of us the hedgehog spikes of the O2 dome; further to the right the winking eye of Canary Wharf; beyond that the violet glow of the Olympic stadium and the flashing red of Anish Kapoor's Orbit tower. \"It's just so beautiful up here,\" says Franglen, exhaling. \"And so quiet, and so secret.\"\n\nSuch hard-earned views are a key incentive for urban explorers, but Franglen doesn't consider himself one of them. \"I'm not really a group person,\" he says. We're sitting on the roof, conversing in low murmurs, like David Attenborough trying not to spook a herd of antelope. \"I like coming to these places at night, which means you see the sunrise and get a sense of the building waking up. It's about connecting with the space. These spaces talk to you in some way. Once you've done it, the world feels like a different place.\"\n\nAfter his first reconnaissance trip in January, he was apprehensive about starting work until, one night, he was on his way back from a gig and spontaneously thought, \"Now. Let's do it now.\" He has been coming regularly ever since. His original plan was to finish it by May and leave it as an installation for urban explorers. \"I was thrilled by the thought of someone discovering it and going, what the hell is this? They'd take photographs and discuss it and it would grow, the same way the plants are growing.\" But the heightened security associated with the Queen's jubilee and the Olympics has slowed him down and kept most visitors away. Now, he says, this article, and a documentary filmed by a friend, will be Legacy's only exposure to the public. \"It's been cut off at the knees,\" he says sadly.\n\nWe hear approaching rotor blades, and crouch, unmoving, beside the low wall that borders the roof. \"It's interesting what one gets scared of,\" he continues after the helicopter has passed overhead. \"For the past few weeks I've woken up every morning with a nightmare and it's never about being caught. It's about not being able to get in and complete what I've been trying to do.\"\n\nI wonder about the kind of person who commits to something like this: all those moments of panic and long hours of solitude. The politics and the artistic challenge don't quite explain it. \"It's pretty obviously an obsession,\" Franglen admits. He used to be a committed motorcyclist until a serious accident in 1998; now he's into scuba diving and cave diving. The goal is always the liberation that comes from intense concentration, when everything melts away but the task at hand. Legacy has had the same effect.\n\n\"There's been a point to doing it, and the point isn't just about what's going on in Stratford. It's about what's going on in here.\" He taps his head. \"Once I've delivered that to myself I need to get on with my life. I haven't had much of a life for the past few months. It's all I've thought about.\" He sighs. \"I've been mauled by it. It should have been so much easier. But I've still done it.\"\n\nThree days later, Franglen emails me to say that Legacy is finished, the last boat (dedicated to Team GB) waterproofed. Out of the blue, a friend who lived locally asked for a tour and became Legacy's fourth and final witness. Then Franglen said goodbye to his temporary domain. \"It felt like the fitting final celebration,\" he writes. \"It was always meant to be shared in some way.\"\n\nUp on the roof on Monday night, however, he knows none of this.

The facilities at Stratford are as good as ever. The park, the flowers, the \"Henman hill\" are a delight. The opening was appropriately zany. Above all, television's celebration of youthful energy \u2013 when spared the endless BBC chat \u2013 is a diversion from the woes of the world. Nor is it fair to chide the athletes for Locog's incompetence, soldiers packing empty seats, public school bias or the weird plutocrats of the \"Olympic family\", whom I saw yesterday tumbling out of our limousines into Harrods.\n\nSo is it worth \u00a39bn? No, of course not. The Games was never worth that. But those who doubted that a passably competent nation with unlimited cash could deliver two weeks of sport were wrong. The Games seems enjoyable and remarkably scandal-free.\n\nMore worrying is the impact on political discourse. Apparently any gesture of national prestige, glory and self-congratulation, once declared by government to be \"worth every penny\", is beyond rational debate. To quarrel with any feature of the games is to be a whingeing, unpatriotic naysayer. Normally hard-headed politicians (and journalists) have gone soft in the head \u2013 flat-earthers, creationists, climate-change deniers.\n\nIn 2005 Tessa Jowell was gushing that Athens had been rendered \"a changed place: cleaner, brighter \u2026 vibrant and modern\", when it was already plunging off the cliff. In his final bid for London 2012 in Singapore, Ken Livingstone dubbed it the \"regeneration games\". Locog's Lord Coe talked of the \"Olympics profit\". David Cameron burbles on about \"making \u00a313bn\".\n\nThis is nothing to do with sport, nor with hosting the Games. It has to do with the manner of the hosting. There is a copious literature on the impact of big-budget sports events on host cities and how to avoid pitfalls. Studies from the International Association of Sports Economists (IASE) are relentlessly cautionary. Postmortems on Atlanta, Barcelona, Sydney, Athens and Beijing all tell of hotel slumps, unpaid debts, empty parks and subsequent disillusion.\n\nA study of Sydney by Australia's Monash University found there was no tangible benefit \"or economic boost\" from the Games. An IASE report on Atlanta called Bidding for the Games: Fool's Gold? found that \"diverting scarce resources from more productive uses translates into slower rates of economic growth\". Civic leaders talk desperately of \"legacy\" but no survey can find any. Barcelona saw hotel occupancy fall from 80% to 50% in the year after the Games. The city's subsequent prosperity is now attributed to cheap flights and the Spanish boom. Beijing has seen no games-related uplift.\n\nOn London, an exhaustive 2006 report for the European Tour Operators Association pointed out that sport is a \"notoriously narrowly focused\" form of travel, with no spillover into wider tourism. \"During the Olympics, a destination effectively closes for normal business,\" it warned. Mark Perryman's spirited survey, Why the Olympics Aren't Good for Us and How They Can Be, charts the same tale. More ironic is Mitchell Moss's How New York City Won the Olympics. It points to how, by losing the 2012 bid, resources allocated to the Games were diverted to the Lower West Side and other, now booming, locations.\n\nThere is no shred of evidence for claims still being made by the government and others of an Olympics profit, fast weakening to a \"promotional legacy\". Nor is there evidence of ministers recovering their brains. Today the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, described talk of ghost London as \"absolute nonsense\". The city was booming, he said, and \"quids in\". The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, attacked ailing businesses, saying: \"This is hardly a surprise \u2026 there has been ample time to plan for [the Olympics].\"\n\nTheir problem is they did. For years Robertson's department told everyone to prepare for a boom. Hotels raised prices and took on extra staff. Bus and tube drivers were paid bonuses to cope with the crush. Central London was told to expect an invasion and that residents should stay at home. This was the tone of every statement from the mayor, Boris Johnson, and his transport boss, Peter Hendy. Either these men were lying or their apparatchiks dared not tell them the truth.\n\nI can find no warning in recent years from any official body that August 2012 would be anything but a cash-rich bonanza. Last week Johnson was still hyperventilating like Big Brother over tube loudspeakers that passengers should expect \"a million extra visitors a day\". He must have known this was rubbish. Reports were pouring in from London business associations of trade at hotel, restaurant, theatre and other tourist venues plummeting by an average of 30%. With August always down, they had been told to greet a \"games uplift\". They must have a strong case for a class action against the mayor, who has been milking the games for all the politics he can.\n\nClearly the authorities massively misjudged, but it was entirely because they refused to believe the evidence of past games. They were glory-blinded. Had the government said from the start that London was a rich city staging the Olympics as a costly but generous gesture to the world, there could be no further argument. Ministers said no such thing. From Cameron down, they claimed the games would make money, now and, if not now, then some time in the future. This was plain dishonest. Everyone knows there is no Olympic legacy, but, as with Santa Claus, we dare not tell the children.\n\nLondon will not recover the cost of the Olympics and may as well forget it. Having spent the money we should at least lie back and enjoy it. But we should stop pretending. The real victims of London's mind-numbing mendacity will be the poor and hapless citizens of Rio in 2016. They really cannot afford it.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/2/1343933484099/Otto-illustration-for-Sim-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15cc3157d4d3076ba4164b00b6d17f8f", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CBoris+Johnson%2CLondon%2CUS+news%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CSport%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/2/1343933484099/Otto-illustration-for-Sim-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b8796b095aded587f2c2f4fc83293566", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Simon-Jenkins,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1137fea1af60259ffbbc3908b7ab7419", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/2/1343933484099/Otto-illustration-for-Sim-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b8796b095aded587f2c2f4fc83293566", "date": "02/08/2012"}, "rank_251": {"title": "We need collaboration to realise Olympic legacy", "text": "London 2012 gives us a unique opportunity to address the deep-seated inequalities that currently prevent children and young people in the six Olympic host boroughs from achieving their potential.\n\nDespite progress in some areas such as antenatal care, the health and life chances of children in these boroughs deteriorates significantly between early and teen years.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of the games is to ensure that once the closing ceremony ends, the Olympic legacy really begins. It is vital, therefore, that any initiatives are evaluated effectively and grounded in evidence.\n\nNew analysis from the London Health Observatory (LHO), provides a baseline picture for Olympic legacy initiatives, and demonstrates an overriding need for a convergence between all the agencies involved in making change happen for these children and young people.\n\nTwo main conclusions can be drawn from the Child's play? report. The first is the clear benefit of antenatal investment to give mothers and babies the best possible start in life.\n\nIt is particularly encouraging that the London borough of Tower Hamlets is achieving notable successes in some of its health outcomes. The borough's low rates of smoking in pregnancy, high rates of breastfeeding initiation and immunisation for measles, mumps and rubella (that are heading towards 100%) indicate that it has acquired valuable expertise in commissioning maternity services; best practice that must be worth sharing between Olympic co-hosts.\n\nThe second conclusion is illustrated by our '400m health hurdles', which shows that early gains made in the antenatal period are not being sustained and as children get older, their health experiences become increasingly mixed. In four of the six boroughs, for example, six to 12-year-olds are less physically active than other counterparts in London, while a higher proportion of 13 to 18-year-olds in Tower Hamlets and Waltham Forest smoke compared to the London average.\n\nPreventing teenagers from lagging behind requires significant investment in the early years \u2013 as heralded by the Marmot Review in 2010 .\n\nIn addition to presenting the current picture of health in the Olympic boroughs, Child's play? includes a health forecast, showing that several positive gains have been made over the last few years. However, this forecast also shows that trends over time have been difficult to interpret.\n\nThe true impact of London 2012 for those starting life in the Olympic boroughs can only be measured through regular monitoring of health indicators in conjunction with effective, long-term and systematic evaluation.\n\nThe LHO has called on all partners involved in delivering the health legacy to collaborate in committing resources to evaluate the impact of change programmes.\n\nThe last challenge highlighted by the report will be delivering the legacy in a new commissioning landscape. It is clear that progress can only be made collaboratively since no single body can have all the answers. Local authorities have to take the opportunity of reconfigured public health services to learn from each other. Alongside this, the Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) need to commission co-ordinated population-based health services that work in tandem with both local government and the Greater London Authority.\n\nIf the 400m health hurdles were to be redrawn for the Olympic Games of 2020, it would be encouraging to find most hurdles safely cleared, a sunny health forecast and a coherent, collaborative commissioning process for the 2012 Olympic boroughs.\n\nDr Bobbie Jacobson is director of the London Health Observatory\n\nThis article is published by Guardian Professional.

There needs to be a total commitment to ensuring a sports participation legacy that has to focus on schools and clubs.\n\n\"For seven years successive governments have been treading water.\n\n\"We have tens of thousands of kids watching great moments which will live with them for ever. The government should step up to the mark.\"\n\nHunt told BBC Breakfast: \"I think at the moment school sport provision is patchy in some places, and we need to do what we can to make sure that the very best examples are spread throughout the whole country, and this is absolutely going to be a focus over the next few months and one of the things that we really want to take away from these Games.\"\n\nHe agreed that investment at primary school level was important, saying: \"Primary school is where it all starts, and catching people young is incredibly important.\"\n\nHowever, it was important to keep a sense of perspective, he said.\n\n\"When you were showing the medals table just then, we're third in the world. Actually the funding of sport has been one of the great successes. John Major set up the lottery in the early 1990s, and in the 96 Atlanta Games we won just one gold medal, we've already won 16 in these Games, and we are only halfway through.\n\n\"Other countries are now looking at the UK, and looking at our sport funding model, and seeing what they can learn.\"\n\nMoynihan said children should be given the chance to try minority Olympic sports such as handball, and primary schools help to provide more sporting opportunities. Sport England's focus is on improving participation in the 14-24 age group.\n\nLondon 2012 chairman, Lord Coe, who sat next to David Cameron in the Olympic stadium on Saturday night, said: \"He [the prime minister] was very seized by the need to build on everything he was seeing in that stadium, whether it was the extraordinary performances of our teams, the ongoing challenges of getting more young people into sport, and also the extraordinary potential for the economic legacy.\n\n\"He is very seized by the need to leverage legacy from every nook and cranny of that project. There is a limited window of opportunity.\"\n\nLabour's former sports minister Richard Caborn accused Moynihan of rewriting history.\n\n\"We did invest very heavily in sport under the Blair administration,\" said Caborn. \"The success now in the Olympics is a result of the investment we put into UK sports.\n\n\"Moynihan shouldn't be rewriting history, he should be reflecting on what we did over the last decade to get us to where we are now. He is not acknowledging the work that was put in over the last decade.\n\n\"We put money into school sports and we invested money in elite sport and UK Sport. That has got us where we are.\"\n\nSir Menzies Campbell, former Liberal Democrat Leader and one-time holder of the UK 100m record, said: \"I fully support Colin Moynihan's call for greater investment in school sport.\n\n\"For far too long in this country we have turned against competitive sport in schools but there is no doubt in my mind that if we are to sustain the wonderful legacy from these Olympic Games we must accept that competition is the very lifeblood of sporting achievement.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/6/1344240197948/Jessic-Ennis-wins--008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8f3c2f9adca23c3fbfb9dcea2a45e6f4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/6/1344240197948/Jessic-Ennis-wins--008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3072ff741c643574f5a77bab32cd94f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2CSchools%2CSport%2CUK+news%2CEducation%2CEducation+policy%2CPolitics%2CJeremy+Hunt%2CSebastian+Coe%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/6/1344240197948/Jessic-Ennis-wins--008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8f3c2f9adca23c3fbfb9dcea2a45e6f4", "date": "06/08/2012"}, "rank_103": {"title": "London 2012: who is claiming credit for the Olympic Games?", "text": "As the medals pile up, the debate begins about who should take credit and what the Olympics mean for modern Britain\n\nWho is claiming the Games?\n\n1.

Buchan's observation was retweeted 3,000 times. \"There must be something in the water, that and the Yorkshire pride,\" concluded Mick Hill, Jessica Ennis's javelin coach.\n\nAnd if the Games continue on their current pleasing trajectory, there will be more of this.

It is important that we encourage this sense of community and inspire young people to continue volunteering. I know many first time volunteers involved in the Olympics and we need to capitalise on their enthusiasm and experience.\n\nWe need to create and develop opportunities that are not just sporting related: We must develop cultural and community-based opportunities. I believe that as a sector we have to get organised, as well as reach out and develop ways that people can get involved using all the tools at our disposal. We must be creative, positive and enthusiastic about using the Olympics as a way of increasing volunteering like never before.\n\nThe Olympic volunteering programme has taught us the importance of brand: I am increasingly interested in the idea of \"brand\" when it comes to volunteers. The sense of pride and engagement people feel when they are part of a movement is a great concept that we should think about when designing roles and developing programmes.\n\nSusanne Rauprich \u2013 Chief Executive of National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYO)\n\nI was amazed by the number of young people who were recognised for their contribution: Carrying the torch was a fantastic opportunity for young people, who are often viewed negatively, to be featured in their local communities. We need more moments like this for as many people as possible - that would help to build communities and bring people together.\n\nI was impressed by the way in which the Olympics have influenced communities outside of London: I have watched with interest the range of events going on in all parts of the UK, specifically through the Cultural Olympiad. The Games Makers come from all over the UK and beyond \u2013 people travelled from Scotland and other countries, and there are volunteering roles at all the Olympic venues. My hope would be that the Games Makers will carry their experience back to their local communities and make things happen there.\n\nOne way of ensuring there is a lasting legacy is to make positive stories from the Olympics available to a larger audience: We could collect stories on existing websites and portals and there are numerous facebook groups, Twitter lists and other social media platforms where Olympic volunteers can remain in contact with one another that have been set up by Games Makers. We should find ways of making use of these sites to advertise volunteering opportunities.\n\nMike Locke \u2013 Mike Locke \u2013 director of public affairs, Volunteering England\n\nThe scale of the volunteering effort for London 2012 is important for volunteering in society: It has demonstrated how much volunteers contribute and how well, and has raised the profile of volunteering in public discourse as well as in government and policy-making circles. I was at the technical rehersal for the opening ceremony and it was amazing to see hundreds of volunteers in the performance.\n\nSome successes to learn from LOCOG: We need to continue to create volunteering opportunities that give people a buzz and a sense of contributing to something important. Volunteering should be fun and we need to create more\n\nappropriate opportunities for future volunteers by appealing beyond the main audience. We must also moderate the excitement and provide good inductions and training.\n\nWe need to have an evaluation of the Olympic volunteering programme: It has been frustrating to not have a proper evaluation in place. There are some individual university researchers who are surveying volunteers and interviewing people, but there are no funds for a full evaluation of the Games Maker programme. Perhaps voluntary organisations should organise to assemble and report on this data.\n\nOlly Benson \u2013 YouthNet\n\nThe Olympics volunteering programme has taught the sector the importance of getting it right: It has shown the need to contact people quickly and to keep them informed. We must find ways of making volunteers feel valued. The Games Maker programme also highlights the importance of recognising how people feel when things don't go right or when they are uninformed.\n\nSecondly, the Games have taught charities the importance of creating a value attached to their volunteering: Someone who is a Samaritans volunteer, or an RNLI volunteer, or a Scout Leader has a certain value attached to their role that is not just recognised internally, but by the wider public. Organisations need to think about how they publicly put volunteers at the heart of their operations. LOCOG intentionally didn't talk about volunteers, but gave them a distinctive brand of Games Makers to reinforce the fact that they were the ones who enabled the Games to happen.\n\nThirdly the Games have taught that it is important to be open to public scrutiny: I think organisations need to be prepared to allow their volunteers to talk about the good and bad experiences they are having, and then to learn from the feedback. I have heard about organisations that have barred their volunteers from talking about their experiences on public forums. LOCOG have had a lot of scrutiny of their programme and one thing organisations can take away from the Olymnpic volunteering programme is to ask themselves, how would their volunteering fare under similar levels of scrutiny?\n\nJoanna Shaw \u2013 Public Zone\n\nCharities need to be ready to mobilise people who have been inspired to volunteer by the Olympics: Be at the top of Google search results and make it easy for people to volunteer for you. After the Olympics there will be thousands of people in the UK who have been inspired to volunteer and charities need to ensure they are coming up in search engines. Eg. When people google ' I want to volunteer with children/sport/schools' they should aim to be top of that list.\n\nThere is a big role digital and social media can play: Organisations need to use the positive stories of the Games to promote and engage their online communities. Learnings, evaluations, stories and lessons learnt could benefit the sector hugely so we should find ways to curate these online. It is going to be difficult for the impact of the Games to be felt outside of London and digital technology could be really helpful. Volunteering organisations and charities who have supporters outside of London can use the content, stories and case studies generated throughout the Games and proactively push this out to people online. There is a huge opportunity for charities to use online resources to find people and to offer them volunteering opportunites. Central to this is the creation of good, relevant, searchable content, whether that is using social media or a website.\n\nMake people feel proud to volunteer: Giving volunteers an identity like 'Games Makers' gives them an extra incentive to get involved and to shout about their experiences. I think LOCOG have been very successful in shifting perceptions about volunteering, showing that volunteers have real jobs and are often senior, experienced professionals and not always casual workers. An example of this is medical volunteers. The strong brand and 'Games Maker' identity has empowered volunteers to feel no different than official Olympics employees. The more charities treat their volunteers as real staff, the more effective and engaged they are. Having an official email address that volunteers can use can make a huge difference in making volunteers feel more valued.\n\nKate Bowgett \u2013 Association of Volunteer Managers (AVM)\n\nI am cynical about whether there will be a lasting positive impact for the voluntary sector: I am not sure whether the motivation to volunteer for something like this is the same as the motivation to volunteer at a homelessness day centre or to mentor children in care. I am also a little sad that there seem to be a lot of people out there who have had a rather negative experience of applying to be a Games Maker, and I do worry that the bad press around that will put people off offering time to other organisations.\n\nGood Volunteer Managers know that how you respond to people's initial enquiries is vital: A poor response may not just put people off volunteering for you, it may prevent them from ever offering their time again. Knowing that they would have vastly more people wanting to volunteer then they could possibly take on, I think LOCOG should have put more thought and planning into dealing with that, and maybe passing them on to Volunteer Centres.\n\nOne negative experience can end up being shared with a lot of people: There has been a lot of negative comment about the Games Maker programme and that is an important reminder to all volunteer involving organisations that now people share experiences online, one negative experience can end up being shared with a lot of people and not spending the time to get volunteer management right could end up being a bit of a PR nightmare.\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

There's been a great atmosphere in here.\"\n\nBarry had feared the worst about Games time: \"In a word, I thought it would be manic \u2013 transport would be absolute murder.\" But his walk from nearby Plaistow has been no problem at all, and neither has his bus journey back home. Music from the Olympic Park has sometimes reached him through his bedroom window, he said, but that hasn't stopped him and his fellow patrons rising to the East End occasion.\n\n\"We've enjoyed having the foreign visitors. We've been very friendly to them. We've done our bit.\"\n\nA duty as well as a pleasure, then?\n\n\"Of course it is.\"\n\nVisiting athletes have been among the clientele, Wilks said: \"Russians; Americans, drinking the British beer.\" He looked forward to the park reopening for public use next year. \"I'm retired now, and I enjoy walking. Good for children, too. I'm very pleased.\"\n\nHis one strong complaint is that the Paralympics won't be shown on the BBC, but Channel 4 where ad breaks will intrude. \"I pay a licence fee. Are they saying the disabled athletes shouldn't be treated the same?\"\n\nThe Langthorne is on Stratford Broadway, a town-centre street separated from Stratford's teeming public transport hub and vast, new Westfield mall by a block that houses an older retail space. The Stratford Centre contains its share of high-street household names, but has been dwarfed by the giant newcomer since it opened last September.\n\nIn its indoor market, which looks out on to the Westfield side, traders' stories of their Games fortunes vary according to what they sell. Jawad Khan, standing amid packed racks of casual clothes, says business has gone up by 40%-50% since the Olympics began.\n\n\"Visitors are coming in for souvenirs,\" he said, nodding towards T-shirts with union flag themes, prominently displayed. \"We're working seven days a week, until eight at night.\"\n\nOthers, though, complain that too few Games spectators are crossing the street and that those who do aren't buying what they have. \"Horrendous,\" is the word Les Barry uses to describe his delicatessen's turnover. \"We're 40% down.\" His usual local customers are on holiday or just staying away, deterred by parking problems and crowds. Les Berry has been been resourceful, bagging up portable snacks \u2013 \"the olives have been going quite well\" \u2013 but as he talks the wall of fresh eggs stacked behind him begins to look unloved.\n\nBerry is not alone in believing that the ticketed droves pouring off trains across the way are being herded straight through Westfield to the Olympic Park turnstiles beyond, even actively discouraged from exploring Stratford itself. \"We've all been expecting to be busy, but it just hasn't happened.\"\n\nBack on the Broadway, though, the gold rush of goodwill so evident in London at large had touched some Stratford residents too. Carmen Song, who made her home there after arriving from the Philippines 27 years ago, said the Games has caused no problems for her. She's found the influx of visitors exciting, putting Stratford on the map, and is hopeful that it signifies continuing improvement. \"When I first moved here I thought the area was no good, but it has just got better and better. New buildings going up everywhere.\"\n\nBut not everyone is basking in the glow. Just off West Ham Lane, on a footpath bordering Stratford Park, a group of local artists taking their display down from the railings have Olympic scepticism to spare. \"As a local resident it's meant nothing, really,\" said one of them, Angela Daley. \"No inclusion. Not enough jobs for locals. I spent the start of the Games in the Dordogne.\"\n\nShe said that she and her fellow exhibitors want to celebrate the Olympics \"in a more artistic way\", but haven't had the support they'd like from Labour-run Newham council, even though its leader and the borough's mayor, Sir Robin Wales, was due to pay a visit. Angela was pleased to have sold three of her works, but the broad feeling seemed to be that Big Art has dominated the remaking of Stratford. Arrivals at the station are greeted by the Shoal, a high, handsome sculpture of titanium \"leaves\" 250 metres wide. Anish Kapoor's ArcelorMittal Orbit tower looms wonkily from inside the Olympic Park.\n\nAngela's sense of the small and local being crushed by regeneration's big wheels also informed her view of the longer-term economic benefits it's claimed the Games will bring. \"I don't think it will make a lot of difference. The only thing that's happened is new retail jobs in Westfield. That's better than nothing, but where's the inspiration in it?\" Her summing up? \"I suppose we're all a bit disappointed in Newham.\"\n\nThe council would beg to differ. As in other host boroughs, it's easy to find residents who feel excluded by the Games \u2013 inconvenienced by its presence, while being unable as yet to go inside the Olympic Park. Yet on the other side of the Stratford Park railings, Wales has laid on a big screen, beaming the sporting action to all-comers for free. There are food stalls and entertainments too, although on a cloudy, drizzly Tuesday night the security staff who searched my bag as I entered almost outnumbered the punters within.\n\nOne of them, Nazmin Lalaounis, sharing a blanket on damp grass with her mum and a German friend from Forest Gate, described with animation her experience of the local mood. \"Everyone I know is loving it,\" she says. \"A few are moaning about too many people but that's all. There's a holiday atmosphere. My mum likes all the bunting. She wants it to stay.\"\n\nThere's a bit of pride as well. Nazmin, an office administrator, grew up in Dagenham, part of the very different borough to Newham's east. She describes having \"a bit of a culture shock\" when she moved to Stratford, with its huge ethnic and social diversity. But she soon took to defending it.\n\n\"People I work with used to joke that Newham was a place you just passed through. I would say, 'I live there, so go away!' But now Stratford at least is becoming a place to visit.\"\n\nShe recalled Jamie Oliver noting that Newham is rich in fried chicken takeaways, \"but now, with Westfield, there's all sorts of restaurants and delis. It's given people an entry to a different world.\" There's been a wider Olympics effect, she said, going right back to when the Games bid was won in 2005. \"It's made a difference to who is living in my street. A lot of people have moved out. I think it's the cost of living, especially for the ones who are sending money home to other countries. There's a lot more private renting. Some of the landlords seemed to take better care of their properties when the Olympics were getting near.\"\n\nNazmin is conscious too, though, of the drawbacks of such change, praising small-scale neighbourhood efforts to bind the established community together. Newham markets itself is a place where people \"choose to work, live and stay\". Wales wants to slow the borough's population \"churn\" and build \"resilience\" instead. As ever, though, regeneration can prompt an exodus driven by rising house prices and rents as new people with more money move in. On the Broadway, a street food trader who said he lived close by was bluntly resigned to the harshest parts of this effect. \"The investment will be for people with money, and the poor will have to shift out. That's always the story. That's the regime.\"\n\nResearch by east London academics does not contradict this view. Monitoring housing scheme planning agreements along Stratford High Street since 2009, Dr Penny Bernstock and Professor Gavin Poynter report a \"dramatic departure from previous commitments to mixed communities and on-site affordable housing\".\n\nNewham, like all the east London host boroughs, is pledged to achieve social and economic \"convergence\" with the richer, healthier west of the capital. But as Bernstock and Poynter wrote for the Guardian: \"The danger is that this will be achieved by simply changing the population mix rather than transforming the lives of existing east London communities.\"\n\nAvoiding that danger is the post-Olympic political challenge. Meeting it won't be easy. For now, though, there is excitement as well as cynicism in Stratford, an air of opportunity co-existing with the disappointments and doubts. Outside St John's church, a preacher spoke of his conversion from football delinquency and teenage girls performed a dance tribute to visitors from Brazil. Meanwhile, as dusk fell, shutters came down in the Stratford Centre and boy skateboarders replaced departing shoppers on one of its quieter avenues. Will their young Stratford lives be transformed?", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/9/1344522570022/looking-towards-westfield-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=495b6c845075c7d8c56fc0134599e1e8", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CHousing%2CCommunities%2CSociety%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/9/1344522570022/looking-towards-westfield-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ac3fcf5bb84bb66e8e9f89bb267bb2b", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/9/1344522570022/looking-towards-westfield-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=495b6c845075c7d8c56fc0134599e1e8", "date": "09/08/2012"}, "rank_63": {"title": "London 2012 legacy: Coe warns that children likely to be less fit than parents", "text": "The chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, Lord Coe, has warned that the current generation of parents are likely to be the first to be fitter than their children.\n\nIn a plea to politicians to capitalise on the success of the London 2012 Olympics, he implored them to recognise the complexity of the issues surrounding school and grassroots sport.\n\nLondon's organisers won the Games promising they would inspire the nation's youth to play more sport. Coe said he was convinced that they had lived up to it but the \"complex\" debate over school sport should not be about political point scoring or become sidetracked by a debate over the relative merits of competitive sport and exercise.\n\n\"That cross-party debate I hope is a grown-up debate. The one thing that politicians of any hue now recognise is there is an appetite for that,\" said Coe, a former Conservative MP.\n\n\"People have voted with their feet in millions to support British sport. There are sports out there that have never been so popular. There is an appetite.\"\n\nThe shadow Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, has called for a cross-party consensus on the best way to capitalise on the Olympic legacy.\n\n\"We mustn't confuse high quality physical education within schools, and competitive sport. They are, in essence, two different things,\" she said. \"Done properly, they take you to the same virtuous outcome. Everybody recognises that giving young people a competitive outlet through sport is a very good thing.\"\n\nCoe said he was wary of getting embroiled in a party political debate, but appealed for a particular focus on sport in primary schools. Specialist support for primary schools is set to be scrapped during the next academic year.\n\n\"It is my instinct that if you haven't got that pattern and love of sport and that pattern of exercise by year 10 or 11, it is going to be quite hard to introduce that to 14- to 15-year-olds with the cluttered landscape that you are then competing against,\" he said.\n\nCoe called for a mature discussion that could lead to a long-term plan. \"It is really important that we promote competitive support in schools,\" he said. \"It is [also] very important that we recognise that has to be underpinned by good quality physical education and by getting people into patterns of exercise. We have to recognise that we are probably going to be the first generation of parents that are marginally fitter than our kids.\"\n\nHe insisted the inspirational effect of the Games on young people was real and there was a \"limited window of opportunity\" to capitalise.\n\n\"We have really inspired a lot of young people.

We've still got a riot legacy to deal with | Michael White", "text": "Promises of outreach and investment, better facilities and job prospects have been patchily met and sometimes not at all\n\nI think I'm right in saying there was more media coverage this week of the sentencing of the \"Notting Hill mob\", which rampaged through a fashionable London restaurant and shops during the August 2011 riots, than there was of the anniversary of the riots themselves. That's puzzling, isn't it?\n\nAll right, the first anniversary of the shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham on 4 August, and the rioting that spread through parts of London and other cities two nights later, coincided and contrasted with the surge of enthusiasm for the London Olympics, its growing success and the parallel achievements of Team GB.\n\nBoth took many people by surprise, not just those in authority, but ordinary citizens \u2013 horrified last summer, thrilled this one. Even the abysmal weather since early April has relented enough to retain only a bit-part in the collective Olympic memory, which (we hope) will sustain a warm glow through hard times. Wonderful!\n\nBut surely none of that can explain the extent to which the riots were blanked in many places you'd expect them not to be.\n\nThe Guardian carried an extensive series of reports based on LSE-conducted interviews with rioters \u2013 and took a lot of stick when they blamed the police. Likewise the Observer, the Mail (lots of convicted offenders have reoffended!) and the Sunday Telegraph \u2013 which reported that, one year on, a lot of victims are still waiting for compensation from an inefficient and careless bureaucracy \u2013 carried reports.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about the Olympic legacy, but we have a riot legacy to deal with. Perhaps there was a blockbuster on the TV that I missed or in one of the political magazines I no longer monitor as I should. Overall I think we've chosen to look the other way.\n\nThere is a positive case to be made for doing so. In one bit of film I found \u2013 an NBC News report contrasting London's two Augusts \u2013 the Reeves family, who lost their five-generation furniture store in Croydon to an arsonist (since jailed), chose to stress the help they had received from the community and the efforts they are making to pay it back.\n\nTheir surviving store is plastered with upbeat notes this week and Maurice Reeves, 81, told the TV crew how good the feeling had been when the Olympic torch passed through the south London suburb. Corny, I know, but corny is often good. Someone called it \"reverse rioting\".\n\nWhen I contacted a political chum in north London he said basically the same thing. Tottenham was cleaned up within days \u2013 only the stench of smoke and boarded-up buildings remained \u2013 but reputational damage was still hurting it and its retail businesses, he said. Perhaps the Olympics were a helpful distraction. Even cranky David Starkey wrote of \"blessed amnesia\".\n\nAnother reason for forgetfulness is that the government decided not to follow the instant inquiry route of the 1981 Brixton riots, after which a very weighty judge, Lord Scarman, delivered the scathing Scarman report. It highlighted \"complex political, social and economic factors\", not least heavy-handed use of police stop and search powers, and urged Margaret Thatcher's ministers to act to improve conditions and confidence in the police.\n\nThese were the days when Willie Whitelaw, an old-school liberal Tory, was home secretary and some steps were taken to reform the Met and police procedures. A new stress on community relations (rather than race relations) emerged from the rubble.\n\nBut this quote from Scarman could apply to an analysis today: \"Without close parental support, with no job to go to, and with few recreational facilities available the young black person makes his life the streets and the seedy, commercially run clubs of Brixton. There he meets criminals, who appear to have no difficulty obtaining the benefits of a materialist society.\"\n\nA lot of that sounds ominously familiar, doesn't it? Sharon Grant, widow of Bernie Grant, the Tottenham MP, told the BBC that stop and search rates in her area have halved, but that a lot of promises remain unfulfilled. The communications mechanism between police and locals, which broke down so disastrously between Duggan's death and the start of the riots, is still not repaired or improved, she said. Stafford Scott says similar things.\n\nIndeed not. Duggan's family have still not been told exactly how he came to be shot by a police officer while being tailed as part of an anti-gun-crime operation. That's pretty shocking and gives some justification to claims routinely made \u2013 often rather too casually \u2013 that it could all happen again, only worse.\n\nAcpo, the chief police officers' organisation, says it doesn't have \"a standing army\" to deal with disorder on this scale, as some countries, including France, have. The CRS riot police, hanging menacingly around in lorries at sensitive junctions, have been a sight in Paris for as long as I can remember. Were they there before the 1968 riots? I can't recall.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the police response \u2013 better in Manchester and Birmingham than in London \u2013 will be as feeble and poorly co-ordinated as it was in some riot boroughs of London in 2011. But we don't want to go down that road, do we? We want more constructive remedies than the iron fist Eric Pickles seems keen to wave. To flip an old joke, \"a law-and-order Tory is a libertarian whose neighbourhood's been trashed\".\n\nBoth oh-so-familiar camps in this debate have solid points to make. As with the Olympic legacy the riots legacy team made promises of outreach and investment, better facilities and job prospects, which have only been patchily met, sometimes not at all. These are hard times for the economy and public investment, though the Met's attempts to recruit more non-white officers ought to have been more successful than they look, hard times or not.\n\nRichard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, co-authors of that excellent book The Spirit Level, made another assault on what they call \"the poison of inequality\" in the Guardian last week. Lynsey Hanley, whose experience of life at the sharp end is more hands-on, makes another in today's edition. Even in Stratford, east London, the Games must look a million miles away to some residents.\n\nBut the \"no excuses\" camp \u2013 which includes a lot of unprivileged immigrant families of all backgrounds \u2013 have their case to make too. In its critique of the Guardian/LSE study, Reading the Riots, the Sunday Telegraph stated that stop and search rates and unemployment were worse in boroughs like Tower Hamlets and Brent, which did not riot last summer, and that shops, not police buildings, were the main target. The Footlocker looting jibe, a thieving spree by people who didn't expect to be caught, remains a potent one.\n\nAnd do this summer's Olympic champions, drawn from heroically poor backgrounds like boxer Nicola Adams \u2013 her face across the Guardian's front page today \u2013 or the community effort in Flint which supported Jade Jones to her gold goal, as well as more upper crust winners, reinforce the message that poverty and disadvantage is no excuse for urban mayhem?\n\nThe usual suspects are squabbling over that one too. The answer is even more complicated and nuanced than a 100m final. Success in sport takes teamwork and money as well as individual commitment. But we can hardly blame those who look at Adams's grin and answer the question with an uncomplicated yes.\n\n\"Inspiration\" is a sentiment more easily mouthed than achieved. When the Games are over who will have been inspired to do what?", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/10/1344601995528/Media-coverage-of-riots-y-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a1d7929c30dfc4765ecca605ba21402", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=UK+riots+2011%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2CLondon%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/10/1344601995528/Media-coverage-of-riots-y-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=51fda3d55777da95c5ad314f7621e59a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/10/1344601995528/Media-coverage-of-riots-y-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4a1d7929c30dfc4765ecca605ba21402", "date": "10/08/2012"}, "rank_228": {"title": "Olympic Games have shown world what Britain is made of, says Cameron", "text": "Prime minister vows that London 2012 will have positive effect on UK economy as he boasts of sporting and social legacy\n\nDavid Cameron has declared that Britain has \"shown the world what we are made of\" and vowed that the success of the Olympics would leave a positive legacy for sport, volunteering and the British economy.\n\nWith Britain third in the medal table and the Paralympic Games still to come, Cameron used the midpoint of London 2012 to declare that \"Britain delivered\" and had shown itself to be \"not a country whose time has been but whose time has come\".\n\n\"We showed the world what we are made of, we reminded ourselves what we can do and we demonstrated that you should never ever count Team GB down and out.

We in this country are going to make sure that these are not just Games that made history but the Games that helped to shape our future.\"\n\nAs the Games prepared to draw to a close on Sunday, a clearly cheered prime minister paid tribute to a \"truly great country\" where a boy born in Somalia, Mo Farah, could come to the UK, seize on the opportunities \"and run his way into the nation's heart\".\n\n\"Over the last couple of weeks we have looked in the mirror and we like what we have seen as a country,\" he said.\n\nThe prime minister, who has appointed Lord Coe, chair of the London 2012 Olympic organising committee (Locog), as his Olympic legacy adviser to help secure the long-term benefits of hosting the Games, vowed to draw on this spirit to ensure the impact of the Games \"isn't just for the summer, but for good\".\n\nHe promised a \"physical legacy\" that would ensure the Olympic Park was put to good use, an economic legacy \"with new deals broken on the back of these Games\", one for volunteers who want to play a part in a \"bigger society\", and one for sport.\n\nCameron confirmed that sport would continue to receive \u00a3125m a year up to the next Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, with \u00a387m coming from the national lottery and \u00a340m from the exchequer.\n\nThe prime minister also defended his decision to put competitive sport such as football, hockey and netball in a new draft PE curriculum, due to be published in the autumn \u2013 a measure announced over the weekend as he faced down calls to bring back a target for pupils to do two hours of sport a week.\n\n\"We are saying out with the bureaucratic, anti-risk, all-must-have-prizes culture, which has led to a death of competitive sport in too many schools, and in with the belief that competition is healthy, that winning and losing is an important part of growing up\" said Cameron.\n\nHe added: \"The trouble with so many of the top-down targets is they become something that schools think once you've achieved, that's it. I think that's been one of the problems in the provision of sport.\"\n\nThe move will only cover local authority-run state schools, however, since academies and free schools are free to set their own curriculum.\n\nCameron said he believed in giving schools much greater freedom but felt it was \"a mistake\" that the national curriculum currently makes no mention of \"competitive sport\".\n\n\"The two are totally reconcilable \u2013 the competition between schools that we are going to see, now that more schools are academies and more schools have these freedoms, I think will engender great competition in terms of schools wanting to do more to respond to the demand that parents and children have for sporting activity, physical exercise and all the rest of it.\n\n\"So competition and choice and diversity will help to drive up provision but at the heart of the national curriculum should be a few simple ideas about what we mean when we talk about sport in our schools.\"\n\nCommenting on the fact that his two older children were at a state school that didn't have a green space as big as the Downing Street garden to play, Cameron said he wanted his children to have the chance to play mainstream sports such as football, rugby and netball \"alongside really important things in terms of PE\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, defended the requirement for two weekly hours of PE in schools, saying that it had seen a big rise in the number of children doing sport.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"I think at least two hours of sport in school a week, that was the idea that the last Labour government had, I think it was the right thing to do and we saw a dramatic improvement in the number of kids doing two hours' sport \u2013 from something like 25% to 90%.\"\n\nBut the Labour leader stressed he did not want \"political argey-bargey\" and said he wanted to see a cross-party 10-year plan for sport.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CDavid+Cameron%2CPolitics%2CSchool+sports%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CEconomic+policy%2CEconomic+growth+%28GDP%29%2CEconomics%2CBusiness%2CVolunteering%2CVoluntary+sector%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344789320850/David-Cameron-and-Mo-Fara-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0cb653799431e998969b16c2378abdb", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344789320850/David-Cameron-and-Mo-Fara-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=073f3d2eba88e9baf059b2e7a9dbcece"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344789320850/David-Cameron-and-Mo-Fara-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=073f3d2eba88e9baf059b2e7a9dbcece", "date": "12/08/2012"}, "rank_255": {"title": "Lord Coe to become Olympics legacy ambassador", "text": "Lord Coe, the London 2012 organising committee chairman, has accepted an offer from the prime minister to become a \"legacy ambassador\" for the Games.\n\nThe as-yet-undefined role will focus on ensuring British businesses reap the rewards of hosting the Games.\n\n\"Capitalising on everything we've witnessed in the last fortnight and in the last seven years is going to be important,\" he said. \"The prime minister asked if I would help in that process and I said, of course.

The prime minister, David Cameron, said Britain had \"delivered\"; Boris Johnson, the London mayor, declared London had demonstrated it was the \"capital of the world\"; while the former prime minister Tony Blair called it a \"spectacular success\".\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, Johnson noted it was time for \"a little\" triumphalism and \"pointless displays of irritating flag-waving jingo\", after a Games that he said had comprehensibly proved doubters wrong.\n\n\"There were people who were worried that the transport network would not hold up, and that there would be delays on the Tube, and that our antiquated systems would not cope and that there would be a general embarrassment. Remember them?\" he wrote.\n\nInstead the transport system had been so efficient that officials \u2013 who were expected to use Olympic lanes throughout the city \u2013 took to the Underground; the armed forces had worked well with the much-criticised private security firm G4S, and spending was up in the capital, Johnson said.\n\nThe opening ceremony had been \"the best in memory\", despite fears that London would not be able to \"find the resources and the discipline to match the sheer pyrotechnic firepower of the Chinese opening ceremony\".\n\nJohnson wrote: \"As things have turned out, I reckon we have knocked Beijing \u2013 with all respect to our Chinese friends, and greatly though I admired those Games \u2013 into a cocked hat.\"\n\nLondon had been fully immersed in an inescapable feel-good factor, said Johnson. \"Across London there has been a happy maelstrom of parties and celebration ... it has been everywhere, and not just in the centre. Yesterday I cycled down the canal towpath to the Olympic Park, through Hackney; and everywhere I looked there were scenes of riparian merriment of the kind you expect to see at the Henley regatta.\"\n\nPeople who doubted the Games would provide a lasting legacy would also be proved wrong, he insisted. \"These Games have not changed us. They have revealed us as we are: people who can pull off great feats,\" he wrote. \"London has put on a dazzling face to the global audience. For the first time since the end of the empire, it truly feels like the capital of the world.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Downing Street press conference to announce sports would continue to receive \u00a3125m a year up to the next Games in Rio de Janeiro, Cameron said the Olympics would have immediate economic benefits and could kickstart an economic recovery.\n\n\"You only need two words to sum up these Games: Britain delivered,\" he said. \"We showed the world what we are made of, we reminded ourselves what we can do and we demonstrated that you should never ever count Team GB down and out.'\"\n\nCameron said the Olympics had brought the nations of the UK closer together. \"It's a Britain where English, Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish compete in one team and drape themselves in one flag.\"\n\nTony Blair, prime minister when London bid successfully for the Olympics in 2005, said the Games had portrayed a modern, multicultural Britain, proud of both its heritage and traditions and its diverse culture.\n\n\"I think the country has celebrated its values in a fantastic way throughout the Olympics,\" he said. \"We did deliver, the prime minister was right.\" Blair added that the sporting momentum created by the Olympics must not be lost. \"The first thing [we need to do] is make sure we maintain the support for elite sport. Although sport is not only about the people who compete in the Olympics, it does give an enormous boost to sport and to sporting activity, as we have seen.\n\n\"The second thing is to focus again on school sport.

They chose the north because of our warm welcome and outstanding facilities. Sheffield, Scunthorpe and Gateshead's Sage all played host to the Cultural Olympiad, and a large contingent of the 70,000 pink-uniformed Games Maker volunteers who made the Olympics happen came from the north.\n\nAbove all, the north \u2013 and Yorkshire in particular \u2013 has provided the athletes and coaches who powered Team GB to Olympic glory. Sheffield's Jessica Ennis, Ingleby Barwick's Kat Copeland, and the Brownlee brothers from Leeds, to name just a few. We can also claim honorary northerner (Salford-based) Sir Chris Hoy. They, and many others, all put the north above traditional Olympic titans such as Australia and Russia in the medals table; they really did put the north on the global stage.\n\nWhat's even more uplifting is that the ambition, passion and energy that took Ennis & Co. to the top of the podium were already bountiful in their home towns. Visit Leeds, York, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield or Newcastle and you'll find self-confident cities bustling with ambitious young professionals, new shops, rising investment and growing infrastructure.\n\nJust last month, \u00a3560m of new rail spending was injected into the Northern Hub, John Lewis has signed up as anchor tenant for the long-awaited Harewood development in Leeds, and the North East's businesses have won over \u00a3120 million worth of Games-related business. No wonder then that Kevin Grady, Chair of Leeds Civic Trust says his city is having its \"best couple of months for several years\". The image of the north painted by Parry's 'dark satanic mills' - which hasn't been true for a long time - has gone forever. The north is a vibrant, dynamic network of towns, cities and communities, full of life and colour.\n\nBut we can't be complacent. We must still work hard to ensure that the Olympic legacy benefits the north's poorest communities too, not just our city centres and leafy suburbs. The Olympic legacy will mean nothing if it doesn't reach our inner-cities and our neediest kids \u2013 our future Olympians.\n\nMagic Breakfast is the UK's leading school breakfast club charity and we run 45 school breakfast clubs in the north (and over 200 nationally), focused on inner-city Sheffield, Rotherham, Bradford, Leeds, Blackburn, Manchester and Liverpool. We feed hundreds of hungry children every morning in the north (and 6,000 kids nationally) with no government funding, relying on the generosity and support of individual givers and businesses like Leeds-based Bagel Nash who supply us with high-energy bagels.\n\nWe want the Olympics to inspire our kids to lead healthy, sporty lifestyles, but we also want the north's successful businesses, Olympians and local policymakers to work with us to solve the problem of child hunger and poverty for good. The lasting Olympic legacy must be that the north's poorest communities and hungriest children have the opportunity of a better future.\n\nLet's hope too that the northern Games Makers bring back the passion they showed at the Olympic Park and use their talents and energy to help us build a strong Olympic legacy in northern communities: starting new businesses, volunteering for good causes, and working with charities like ours to take on the engrained social challenges like poverty that hold back our young people. Ambitious quangos such as Yorkshire Gold have been set up to ensure the region benefits economically and culturally from London2012. Community charities like Magic Breakfast are working hard to ensure that we benefit socially too.\n\nWe were treated to a fantastic Olympic closing ceremony on Sunday, showcasing all that's best about Britain: our musical heritage and creative industries; our armed forces; our athletes; and our volunteers who've come from every corner of the land. Like Danny Boyle's inspirational opening ceremony, it was a wonderful celebration of all we've achieved as a nation.\n\nLet's also make the end of these fantastic Olympics the start of Britain's long-lasting Olympic legacy, which sees us build a fairer, stronger, more equal country where every young person has opportunity, with the north at the heart of that new nation. These Olympics have been a win for London and Britain. Let's make sure they're a win for the north too.\n\nAlan Mak is from York, and President & Trustee of Magic Breakfast.

The London 2012 Olympic Games went better, far better, than most people ever dared to hope. They will live overwhelmingly positively in the recollection of millions who took part, attended or merely watched on television, here or around the whole world. And beyond that? These have been 17 days that may have changed this country, if not for good, then certainly in a lot of good ways that may, with luck and effort, endure. But today, Britain and its capital must awake to the realisation that the 2012 Olympic Games are over. The dream is now a memory. Although the Paralympics await, it is unlikely that the world's greatest sporting festival will return to this country for at least half a century. It is time to try to take stock of what has been achieved. The rest of our lives begins today.\n\nFirst, the sports themselves. Any successful Games needs a towering figure. Predictably, and to the delight of the organisers and the public alike, this proved to be Usain Bolt of Jamaica. His \"double triple\" \u2013 winning in both the men's track sprints and the 4x100m relay, just as he had in Beijing \u2013 provided the iconic moments of London 2012. The honour of the single greatest achievement, however, probably goes to Kenya's David Rudisha, with his world record demolition of the field in the 800m final. And the greatest new hero to have emerged, certainly to the home crowd, was Mo Farah, with his sweep of both the 10,000m and 5,000m golds. Yet while Bolt, Rudisha and Farah led the field in the blue-riband Olympic sport, many enduring memories will be of the proliferation of other sports in which equally great deeds were done, in front of crowds that yielded nothing in enthusiasm to those in the Olympic Stadium itself. To list all the sports would be tedious, but the multitude of swimmers, cyclists, archers, rowers, riders and team players made these Games far more than an athletics fest with sideshows.\n\nSporting ethos\n\nThese were a good Olympics for sporting ethos too. London 2012's greatest milestone was the equality, and in some respects the superiority, of women's participation. No national team was male-only, for the first time. Though Saudi Arabia's Wojdan Shaherkani lasted a mere 80 seconds in the women's judo competition, her appearance was a symbolic breakthrough. Cheats, it appears, were quickly banished, whether because of drugs or gamesmanship. No Olympian deserves greater honour than the German table tennis player Timo Boll, who ensured his own defeat by insisting, to immense applause, that a point had been incorrectly awarded to him rather than to his opponent. Behaviour of this kind would be unthinkable in football's Premier League, as would the displays of the genuine happiness, humility and gratitude that marked so many medalists.\n\nBritain did superbly well in the Games too. Targets were exceeded and a new generation of stars stepped forward as others, like cycling's Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, departed the stage heavy with new honours. There are two great lessons of all this Olympic success. The first is that, over time, investment in sports will produce a dividend \u2013 this year's British medals are the fruit of lottery funding decisions from the 1990s. The second is that the opportunity to shine must be available to all, without respect to background. Both lessons must be well learned if the momentum is to be carried forward to Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and beyond. The prime minister stood by Sebastian Coe yesterday to give a predictably upbeat verdict on the Games, and he extended one slug of funding for a couple of years. But the country will be watching carefully for the follow-through: it has no need of a brief season of silly grandstanding.\n\nThe Games brought out much that is best in this country. They allowed us a golden glimpse of a nation that celebrates men and women with equal awe, and embraces British athletes of all racial backgrounds. They celebrated the rich shared Britishness of competitors and supporters who are also fiercely proud of diverse roots. London had a wonderful Games, to be sure, but so did Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and English counties from Buckinghamshire to Yorkshire. Few events have done more to rescue the Union Jack from racists and royalists alike, creating a generous mood and a flag to share.\n\nPulling together\n\nAnd then there were the thousands of volunteers who made the whole experience so enjoyable for so many. The British qualities that the Olympics president chose to emphasise this week were enthusiasm and kindness. No one should be naive about these things, but this was a compliment to be welcomed, a reminder that a heterogeneous society can pull together in difficult times to do something worth cheering, generating a more optimistic and ennobling way of seeing ourselves. Was the price right? Opinions will differ. Was the prize worth having? Absolutely. The big question now, and in the unfolding weeks, months and years, is whether the same commitment and generosity can be brought to bear in pursuit of more complex, more lasting and, dare one say it, more important endeavours than Olympic sports. Why should it not?", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2CSport%2CUsain+Bolt%2CMo+Farah%2CTeam+GB%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "13/08/2012"}, "rank_80": {"title": "London 2012 euphoria has died, but will the Olympic legacy live on?", "text": "It was the key pledge supporting London's bid to host the Olympics, made winningly by Lord Coe and the then-prime minister Tony Blair: that a British Games would \"inspire a generation\" to become more involved in sport. A nation still heady with the glories it has witnessed now expects greater sporting opportunities as a legacy of the Games and their \u00a39.3bn cost, but the Olympic torch has not burned away the stubborn realities dragging people the other way. Modern life for most besides those few full-time athletes is increasingly sedentary; Britain's sports facilities are old, tired and seriously underfunded, and being further depleted by swingeing government cuts to local authority budgets.\n\nThe slashing of the \u00a3162m funding of school sport partnerships imposed by the education secretary, Michael Gove, in 2010, has received most criticism in the context of developing a genuine sporting legacy, but encouraging adults to be more active is a greater challenge. Critics say in the seven years since the Games were awarded to London, no sufficiently coherent plan, backed by will and resources, has been developed by the government to capitalise on the post-Olympic rush of enthusiasm. Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, while pointing to the \u00a31bn which Sport England, the grant-giving agency, has to invest over four years from 2013-17, acknowledges that driving up participation is \"very difficult,\" and a major advance is unlikely to come quickly.\n\n\"I think we will see an improvement,\" he said. \"The Olympics have been marvellous, and generated huge interest. But none of the things that made this difficult have been lessened. We are talking about societal change. If participation increases, it is likely to be on a long-term, incremental basis.\"\n\nSome say the prospect of even gradual improvement is being damaged by the government's cuts to local authorities, which own and run public sports facilities, but have no statutory duty to do so. In Sheffield, home of gold medal-winning heptathlete and \"face of the Olympics\" Jessica Ennis, the council is seeking a 20% reduction in its swimming pool, leisure centre and facilities budget, including that of the Don Valley Stadium, where Ennis trains, as it wrestles with a reduction to its government grant of at least \u00a3170m over three years. The council has already \"drastically reduced\" its maintenance of parks, including playing fields, according to its leader, Julie Dore.\n\n\"The chance of an Olympic legacy is being undermined,\" she said, \"and the situation is only going to get worse. We believe in all the benefits of sport, and do not want to close any facilities, but when we are forced to cut on this scale, our statutory responsibilities mean that sport, leisure and parks become an easy target.\"\n\nCouncils are being forced to implement cuts of \u00a36.25bn, 28% of their grants from the government, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, according to the Local Government Association. Playing fields, sports centres and swimming pools, and the staff to run them, are under threat and many budgets are being cut. The LGA warned earlier this year that by 2020 funding of discretionary services, including sport, faces a 66% reduction, and could disappear, due to the mounting cost of adult social care, which councils must provide. A survey of councils by the Chief Cultural and Leisure Officers Association (CLOA) earlier this year found that services, including arts and culture as well as sport, are suffering reductions of around 10% on average, with further cuts to come. So far, the CLOA estimated, 2,800 jobs have been lost in the sector.\n\n\"The sheer scale of ongoing cuts to local government funding represents the biggest single threat to a participation legacy for London 2012,\" said Andy Burnham, the shadow health minister.\n\nThe \u00a31bn government and lottery funding of Sport England is the prime national vehicle now for encouraging participation, distributed to the governing sports bodies, which have targets to meet. A central aspect of the strategy is to link local sports clubs with schools, which often have an area's best facilities, and to staunch the huge drop in people taking part in sport after they leave education.\n\nJennie Price, Sport England's chief executive, is optimistic for a post-Olympics increase in participation, but acknowledged many governing bodies, whose role has traditionally been focused on running clubs and competitions, were not equipped for the new development drive. She cited hockey, netball and cycling as examples. \"We have a reasonable chance,\" Price said. \"Around half the governing bodies have a good understanding of what motivates participation and are evolving different models of their sports to make them attractive.\"\n\nThe challenge of helping people to be more active has grown into a major public health issue, although there remains limited co-operation across government departments responsible for different aspects of the problem. Sport England's survey in April 2012 found 15.3m people, 35.7% of the population, participated in at least 30 minutes of moderately intensive sport once a week, the recommended minimum. Department of Health guidelines for people to be active, which include brisk walking for at least half an hour five times a week, is met by only 37% of British adults, according to research published last month in the medical journal, the Lancet.\n\nSo, the nation still hugging itself with pride at the prowess of Team GB athletes has 64% of its adults not playing sport once a week, and 63% not even walking often enough to be physically healthy.\n\nThe mental and physical health consequences of inactivity are the subject of persistent official warnings; the latest NHS health survey for England found that in 2010 68% of adults were obese or overweight, a growing tendency in recent times, and 16% of children were obese. The economic cost of obesity is estimated at \u00a350bn a year by 2050, \u00a39.7bn to the NHS.\n\nYet despite the warnings, progress towards increasing participation has been slow, and several ambitious targets have been abandoned. Sport England's figures show there was a jump of almost 1m in 2007-08, but since then, only around 400,000 more people have been drawn into playing sport.\n\nGiven the stubborn factors pulling people to inactivity, it was always controversial for Coe and Blair to claim that hosting the Olympics would inspire a generation to do more. Surprising as it sounds, while inspirational feats still feature vividly in the national mind, no previous Games has led to a general increase. Blair made the claim even though his Downing St strategy unit had stated in a 2002 report, Game Plan, that the links are tenuous between watching top athletes perform and being motivated to do sport.\n\n\"There is little evidence that hosting events has a significant influence on participation,\" Game Plan concluded. It advised that hosting events such as the Olympics would produce surging national pride, but for a huge cost: \"It would seem that hosting events is not an effective, value for money method of achieving a sustained increase in mass participation.\"\n\nNevertheless, three years later, Blair pledged to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore that a London Games would do exactly that. Coe later admitted the claim was not supported by research or a strategy for how participation would be increased. Then the \u00a32.4bn budget presented by Coe's bid team, supported by the government, rocketed to \u00a39.3bn, a golden pot of public money which was protected even as government funding was slashed around it.\n\nThat huge expense, vindicated by the sparkling and brilliantly-organised success of the Games, dwarfs the money available to build and maintain sports facilities, and run sport development programmes, across the country. Chris Gratton, professor of sport economics at Sheffield Hallam University, explains that Britain's limited public sporting stock dates from two phases: late Victorian and early 20th century philanthropy when swimming pools were built, then leisure centres, the fruits of sudden local authority financial surpluses, in the 1970s. \"Our commercial facilities, such as private gyms, are relatively good,\" Gratton said, \"but since the 1970s, comparatively few public facilities have been built.\"\n\nUnder the previous Conservative government, cuts to local authority budgets saw many facilities decline, and thousands of playing fields sold off. A review for Blair's government by Baron Carter of Coles in March 2005 found that rebuilding sports facilities to modern standards would cost around \u00a34.5bn. Yet no major rebuilding programme has taken place, and just over twice that figure was spent building the Olympic facilities.\n\nGratton said all research into sports participation shows poverty and inequality lead to people being less active. Finland, which has Europe's highest rates of sports participation, thanks to a strong public health message and making facilities available locally, is a more equal society than Britain. \"Poorer people suffer social exclusion,\" Gratton said, \"which, by definition, applies to exclusion from sport, too.\"\n\nRobertson agrees, and accepts the cuts to councils will not help. \"I do recognise that poverty and inequality affect participation,\" he said. \"And it would be dishonest not to recognise that local authorities cutting budgets will have an impact.\"\n\nHe pointed in compensation to changes in lottery distributions which he championed, increasing the proportion of the lottery total going to sport from 13.7%, to 20%, enabling Sport England's \u00a31bn four-year funding. He identified too a specific Olympic legacy programme, Places People Play, targeted at making small grants to facilities in poorer areas \u2013 the initiative's budget is \u00a3135m over three years.\n\nRobertson said that while the Games were a huge success, and had given sport \"a tremendous boost,\" the afterglow is unlikely to translate into a great upsurge in participation.\n\n\"We have held an Olympics which surpassed expectations; it has produced an amazing stimulus, and a new generation of sporting heroes. However anybody who remotely pretends it will be easy to increase general participation in sport is kidding themselves.\"\n\nSo, the claim that a London Games would inspire a generation to do more sport, is in danger of being an over-promise. After the euphoria, the battle is against sedentary culture, junk food, haggard sports facilities, too few opportunities, local authority cuts, and, for young people, inequality between private and state schools. If this landscape undergoes no post-Olympic transformation, Britons who supported the Games so wholeheartedly may come to feel short-changed by its legacy.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2CSport%2CFitness%2CLife+and+style%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CJessica+Ennis-Hill%2CLocal+government%2CSebastian+Coe%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/David-Conn,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b938091e640223126af0fe98e538ca2f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/14/1344969012946/London-2012-Olympic-Games-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fb3f835f9a9368f4372ca8bf868d0706", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/14/1344969012946/London-2012-Olympic-Games-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c45f740d5af9945c4f2196977635511", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/14/1344969012946/London-2012-Olympic-Games-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fb3f835f9a9368f4372ca8bf868d0706", "date": "14/08/2012"}, "rank_160": {"title": "Olympic diary: five outline legacy goals", "text": "By contrast with Monday's richly confident \"five things I've loved\" about London 2012, here's an intermittently diffident quintet of broad objectives for that elusive concept known as \"legacy.\" Let's dignify it as an early draft.\n\nBBC 5 Live's Mark Chapman has more than once expressed his dislike for the \"legacy\" word these past few days, and if his reason is that its meaning is slippery to the point of treachery I sympathise. That said, we have been faithfully promised that good stuff will flow from that nine billion quid investment, and keep flowing for generations to come. What will the good stuff look like? How will it be supplied? Mostly importantly, who will gain?\n\nSuch questions are of great importance to residents of the Olympic host boroughs in particular, for London as a whole and for other cities too. The Games provide a massive test case for urban regeneration projects, which are often accused of doing less than they should for the neighbourhoods they change, and even of harming the communities there. Canary Wharf, easy to spot from the Olympic Park, is often condemned as an example of how to get regeneration wrong. So here's how the back of my envelope looks.\n\nOne: help local people secure the new jobs. Newham council is proud of its workplace scheme, which helps bring its residents and new employment opportunities together - over 10,000 since 2007, it says, and 5,000 this year, half of whom it defines as long-term unemployed. The borough's mayor Sir Robin Wales prizes his partnership with the Westfield mall, and there are more projects of various kinds in the pipeline. Hackney's mayor Jules Pipe is upbeat about the prospective tenant for the Olympic Park's two media buildings iCITY, which has indicated that it is keen to recruit locally. The objectives here seem sound. Success will be their being put into (continuing) effect. Also, there are four other host boroughs hoping for a employment legacy, but without flagship new employers within their boundaries. Their residents too must be helped to claim their legacy share.\n\nTwo: housing must be truly affordable. Sceptics hold it to be self-evident that regeneration leads to gentrification which leads to the economic expulsion of the very poorer residents regeneration was meant to help. It's not as simple as that: private landlords might hike their prices, forcing low income tenants to migrate, but social housing tenants aren't vulnerable in the same way; residents who've owned their own homes since the not so far off days when someone on an ordinary sort of London wage could get a mortgage might see a gentrification-driven rise in property prices as an opportunity to sell up and move to somewhere leafier, following a trail East Londoners have beaten for generations.\n\nAll that said, the host boroughs are as much in the grip of London's housing crisis as the rest of the capital. If regeneration deepens rather than alleviates it by making accommodation more expensive, the value of helping local people into jobs and improving their education will be diminished. If, for example, a young local person's wage from a Westfield or iCITY job isn't sufficient to cover this huge component of the cost of living, he or she may start looking for somewhere cheaper to live. The latest figures from the HomeLet Retail Index show that private rent levels in London as a whole have risen by 8.4% over the past year and in East London by a massive 13.3%.\n\nSir Robin Wales wants to reduce local population \"churn,\" caused by people who've bettered themselves in Newham choosing to move to somewhere posher rather than stay. It would a sad thing if regeneration resulted in such people now wanting to stay but having to move anyway because they can't afford to stay put. There's only so much any local authority can do to hold local accommodation prices down, but government policy is hardly helping - it has slashed investment in affordable homes and created a grant mechanism which ensures that those that are built are less \"affordable\" than they might have been. Boris Johnson has not complained. After all, he supports government policy.\n\nWe see the effects of this in plans for housing in the post-Games Olympic Park itself. Fifty percent of what is currently the athletes' village will be in the \"affordable\" range - half intermediate, half for social rent - under arrangements made some time ago. But only 28% of the homes in Chobham Manor, which will be the first of the five new neighbourhoods that the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) is responsible for delivering, will be affordable. The neighbourhood might include a community land trust, which would help, and the LLDC says it is \"aiming for 35% affordable housing across the Park \u2013 in line with the [London] Mayor's London Plan.\" But how truly affordable will that 35% be? Wouldn't 50% be better? Is anyone powerful going to complain?\n\nThree: transport infrastructure should be bold as well as big. Crossrail and Stratford International are the big strands of the regeneration transport plan, but what other threads should be woven in? Reviving plans for a Docklands Light Railway extension to Dagenham Dock would be good. River crossings for road transport in the Thames gateway excite great passions, with some being opposed to all and any, while others argue over the respective merits of the Silvertown tunnel Mayor Johnson favours and the Gateway bridge further east that he mothballed in 2008.\n\nI can see the case for a new road transport crossing and lean towards a Gateway bridge, but also favour a different road management approach across London. We should use road pricing to reduce congestion and make the road network far more friendly for cyclists. Environmental and economic interests coincide here, but will the common ground be boldly built on? I know what you're thinking. Me too.\n\nFour: a volunteer spirit that lasts. Boris Johnson has just appointed his old media chum Veronica Wadley for the role of (ahem) \"Senior Adviser for Team London, Volunteering, Charities and Sponsorship.\" It's not the first time he's given her a helping hand into a jolly important position. Maybe he thinks he's still in her debt. Wadley edited the most hopeless incarnation of the Evening Standard ever, a spiteful Johnson fansheet for which her successor felt the need to apologise with a huge advertising campaign. This does not bode well.\n\nStill, the generosity and warmth of the games-makers and ambassadors who so enriched London 2012 was not brought into existence by City Hall and can be spread and harnessed in many ways in the future. There's a role for the host boroughs here. Newham is proud to lay claim to the young woman with whom Usain Bolt was having such a nice chat in the Olympic stadium before being rudely interrupted by the 200 metres final. Perhaps a host borough volunteering summit could develop ways of working together to build on that success.\n\nFive: a sporting legacy should embrace all. Iain Dale suggested to me during his LBC programme on Sunday that the Olympics host boroughs could collectively embrace sports as a specialism in their schools. I can see the attraction. But what should the objective be?\n\nPoliticians, especially Tories (no offence, Iain), have seized the opportunity presented by the Olympics to reprise their historic refrain about the character-building virtues of competitive team sports and how \"political correctness\" has \"banned\" it. Give me strength. Competitive sports, team and individual alike, are great for kids who love and excel at them as I did as a child, but guarantee pointless misery for those who don't. This does not build character, it damages it.\n\nThere is also a downside to revering sporting excellence in schools. Being good at, say, football can bring a boy such prestige that he regards everything else as secondary and those who lack his gifts as second class. Children like that don't require encouragement to take part in sport, they need lessons in perspective and humility. The guiding principles for school sport should be the same as for any other discipline - helping all children to do the best they possibly can and tailoring the most effective approach to each level and type of ability.\n\nThat requires flexibility and creativity, not some fatuous nostalgia for muscular Christianity. The goal for each child should be the same as for many of Briton's athletes at the Olympics. Not all can be medalists, as children who struggle sport lessons or any other type know only too well. But with the right help and guidance all can improve and go on improving their personal bests. A sporting culture of that type embedded in the East End would be a very fine legacy indeed.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Society%2CRegeneration%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CPolitics%2CLocal+government%2CBoris+Johnson%2CMedia%2CLocal+politics%2CVeronica+Wadley%2CLondon%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/09/Polly_Toynbee,_L.png", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/5/1344123103215/493cff56-529c-438f-8559-a0a4432bc3ef-460.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1493a601eb5d6d18941cfb9fe03d0eea", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/13/1344862298479/Gold-post-box-in-Chorley--008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=768948dc2cc2686d37170916cdccaa57", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/5/1344123103215/493cff56-529c-438f-8559-a0a4432bc3ef-460.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c5bc19115f7e17d2a1aa4c0b54182936", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344943851494/Spectators-at-the-Olympic-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b57893b12993907abdb9644aab603007", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344940427117/Chinese-tourists-outside--010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=004b77a1495c9df657e13e740cbdb269"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/5/1344123103215/493cff56-529c-438f-8559-a0a4432bc3ef-460.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1493a601eb5d6d18941cfb9fe03d0eea", "date": "14/08/2012"}, "rank_232": {"title": "London 2012's school sport legacy? Maybe it slipped Cameron's mind", "text": "You would have thought it would be ringed in red on the Downing Street calendar: '12 August, Olympics closing ceremony, make announcement placing sport at heart of health/education policy to capitalise on Games feelgood factor'.\n\nBut either David Cameron was too busy enjoying the sport in his Team GB polo shirt or he simply forgot. Maybe the last minute panic to plug gaps in Olympic security was a distraction. Or perhaps he never intended to use the Games to do so in the first place.\n\nEither way, there is a certain irony in the fact that a big hole in the coalition's sports policy has been exposed by the triumph of London's Games and the heroic performances of British athletes.\n\nWhen London won the right to host the Games in 2005 in Singapore, under the Labour government, those at the heart of the project proclaimed it was a once-in-a-generation corrective: an opportunity to place sport at the heart of health, education and social policy; to knit together a coherent plan so the \u00a39.3bn cost of the Games would catalyse the estimated \u00a31bn investment in sport, across elite funding, schools, the grassroots and local authorities; to cut down on duplication and bureaucracy; and to give sport a role at the heart of government rather than considering it a sideshow.\n\nThat didn't happen for the rest of Labour's tenure, although huge investment in school sport began to pay dividends and there was some (but not enough) progress in directing a proportion of the health budget to prevention rather than cure. And it certainly hasn't happened under the coalition, largely because the education secretary, Michael Gove, saw fit to dismantle a hugely effective school sports network on ideological grounds.\n\nThe School Sports Partnerships hobble on in reduced form, having had their funding slashed from \u00a3162m to \u00a365m, but even that reduced funding runs out next year. Just as worryingly, the money to release specialist PE teachers to work in primary schools is also due to run out in the next academic year.\n\nWhile the government has promised to continue funding the elite performance system that led to an avalanche of medals \u2013 not a difficult call in the wake of a record medal haul in return for \u00a380m extra over two years \u2013 and there is at least a vaguely coherent plan in place for the grassroots (albeit with no increase in funding or guarantee it will work), the incoherence of the government's policy on school sport undermines that progress.\n\nSir Keith Mills, who played an instrumental role in winning the Games for London and delivered the successful International Inspiration overseas legacy programme, has called for a wholesale rethink of sports administration and a new national plan that is backed at the highest levels of government \u2013 one that can't be unpicked by future ministers.\n\nAnd Lord Coe, the hero of the hour after helming a hugely successful Games, has called for a wide-ranging debate that recognises the need for a cross-party, cross-departmental long-term plan. The government would do well to listen to them.\n\nInstead, we have had Cameron's ill-advised broadside against \"Indian dancing\", and a return to the tired debate of competitive sport versus exercise. It is a red herring because both have their place; instilling in children a love of exercise for its own sake and allowing them to get the most out of organised sport are entirely compatible.\n\nBut both need time, money and expertise at both primary and secondary level. While the Department of Culture, Media and Sport is busy investing in a new strategy to stop 14 to 25 year olds dropping out of sport, the Department for Education is undermining the chances of them getting into it in the first place.\n\nSports minister Hugh Robertson, who has spent eight years either in the role or its shadow, warned of the complexity of the debate and said it was no time for kneejerk reactions or policy on the hoof.\n\n\"It is deeply unhelpful. To see the school sport debate simply as a question of competitive sport versus participation is an over-simplification. There are a number of ingredients in this pile: the number of PE teachers and what they do, the role of after school clubs, the role of school club links, primary provision and all the rest of it. It's a complicated, bigger picture,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\n\"I have been tearing my hair out for the last three or four days because the terms in which this debate has been conducted have not been helpful to finding a solution. The last thing we want is a school sport initiative. We want to have a structured think about how to move forward.\"\n\nBefore the Games, culture secretary Jeremy Hunt seemed more concerned with whether there would be enough ponchos to go around if it rained or how to control the crowds expected to pour into central London. After it, he railed against a reporter who asked whether enough was being done to develop a cross-departmental strategy to maximise the Olympic legacy.\n\n\"I am absolutely astonished that you even dare to ask that question after the most stunningly successful example of joined-up government that any of us have ever seen, with 19 government departments working incredibly well to put on a wonderful Games,\" he said.\n\nHe would do well to instead listen to Coe \u2013 who has taken on the unpaid role of \"legacy ambassador\" \u2013 and his own sports minister.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344967246309/Dame-Kelly-Holmes-right-j-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1523f0162d71c75ab85663ffc47c05dd", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CSchool+sports%2CHealth+policy%2CEducation+policy%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CEducation%2CPolitics%2CDavid+Cameron%2CConservative+and+Liberal+Democrat+cabinet%2CConservatives%2CSebastian+Coe%2CJeremy+Hunt%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344967246309/Dame-Kelly-Holmes-right-j-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=eb14bad8723acdd0c1fe34e107bf3922", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344967246309/Dame-Kelly-Holmes-right-j-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1523f0162d71c75ab85663ffc47c05dd", "date": "14/08/2012"}, "rank_81": {"title": "If London is now a 'can-do' city, what can it do with the Olympic spoils? | Dave Hill", "text": "One of the media's more seductive Olympics tunes urged us to marvel at a capital transformed. London 2011 was flaming and riot-torn, it sang, but London 2012 is glowing with glory, civility and efficiency.\n\nThe previous summer was behind us. The true character of the city had been revealed, the shocking horrors of last August buried by history.\n\nWishful thinking, I'm afraid. I've loved Olympic London. Games time really has showcased us at our very best. It still feels a bit spoilsport to argue for perspective, even though the main show has now closed. But for every golden triumph there is a torn achilles heel, for every Super Saturday, a tale of disappointment and dismay.\n\nThe capital's shopping streets have given us a foretaste of that story. A full balance sheet cannot be drawn up for a while, but big West End operators and East End small traders alike are among those reporting fallen sales. Perhaps they will all gain in the end, but some will always feel they've been sold a false dream.\n\nThis uneven spread of Games-time spoils may anticipate the bigger, longer picture \u2013 the true social and economic legacy. London mayor Boris Johnson has spoken of a \"can-do city\" for which the future is shiny bright, telling the \"doom and gloom merchants\" they were wrong to predict that London would implode under the strain of staging the greatest sporting show on Earth, and pledging that \"the catalyst of the Games\" will attract investment to every development prime site in town.\n\nEnthusing is what Johnson does best. He is right that the various authorities deserve great credit, not least Transport for London, which, with the help of the public, has confounded predictions of \"transport chaos\". Maybe the mayor will be right about an investment bonanza, too, but this is where the complications start. The legacy aspiration is to move London's centre east, bringing health and wealth to parts of the capital that have long been mostly poor. But will the less well-off enjoy the promised benefits?\n\nHost borough Newham is proud that its partnership with the giant Westfield mall, which overlooks the Olympic Park, has helped local people secure some of the newly created jobs. But this part of east London, still wounded by the hammer blow closure of the docks, is a very big ship to turn around. BBC London has reported that Johnson-backed schemes to secure a long-term Olympics job boost for London's unemployed, one of them targeted at the host boroughs, have fallen short of their goals.\n\nHousing costs are a crucial factor. Improved transport links and schools, which Newham and fellow host boroughs have worked hard to secure, help local people find and hold down work and attract incomers bearing social capital and spending cash from which all can profit.\n\nBut will a retail or restaurant job pay well enough for a young East Ender to secure an East End mortgage or pay an East End private sector rent if, as typically occurs, gentrification pushes prices even more insanely high than they are now?\n\nFor some home-owners, this regeneration effect might provide an opportunity to sell up and head for Essex or Kent, following a long-established trail. For others, though, outward migration will continue to be borne of unwelcome necessity, not choice. Academics have warned that any \"convergence\" of living standards between their part of the capital and the more affluent west might end up being achieved \"by simply changing the population mix, rather than transforming the lives of existing east London communities\" unless enough homes, including the new ones to be built, are genuinely affordable to people on low and even middle incomes.\n\nGovernment housing and benefits policies are intensifying this problem on the grounds of deficit-reduction. The mayor supports those measures, when he should be flaying them publicly. Meanwhile, his political interests and core convictions suggest he won't rush to exploit other possibilities for a better London that Games time transport arrangements have raised. Encouragingly, he's praised the seemingly successful greater use of night-time freight deliveries, but seems less keen on home-working or managing road space differently. A bedrock Tory, Johnson's moral message from the Games is that competition conquers all. If only urban life were that simple.\n\nMeanwhile, London's biggest problems remain: mountainous youth unemployment, child poverty, overcrowding, territorial street rivalries, costly road traffic congestion and the highest public transport fares of any big city in the world. A year on from those riots the mother of Mark Duggan, whose shooting by police lit a hidden tinderbox of resentment, violence and pitiless rage, says she's had no proper explanation for why her son died. Olympic London has brought joy and optimism. Long may they endure.

Her organisation, she said, was supporting London's Olympic bid because it was almost impossible to make anything happen in the Thames Gateway, which extended from east London through south Essex and north Kent to the sea, and only the Games could change this.\n\nShe was in this position because even longer ago, in the John Major era, the relevant minister, Michael Heseltine, had made a speech christening the Thames Gateway and announcing that Something Must Be Done. So the vast effort of the Olympics had to be enlisted to make some sense of a politician's figure of speech. It was and is a seriously arse-about-face way of doing a bit of regeneration.\n\nOver the next 20 years it is hoped to build 8,000 homes around the Olympic Park, in addition to the 2,800 already created by the athletes' village, and to create 8,000 jobs \u2013 that is, to make something like a middle-sized market town. In fairness, one should add the less tangible but real benefit of a feelgood factor to a wider area of east London. To achieve all this will have required not only the Olympic billions, but also investment in public transport in Stratford unmatched anywhere else in the country, an additional grant of \u00a3290m to be spent on legacy, and more hundreds of millions of public money spent acquiring land. Some of the public expenditure will be paid back as this land is developed, but there are no obligations as to how much or when.\n\nBut never mind. Not many people now care that Olympic claims for boosting business, tourism and regeneration are tenuous. Opinion polls show that most people in Britain think that \u00a39bn or so is not too much to pay just for the national buzz and joy that came with the Games. So the question is: how can this place so extraordinarily blessed with aspiration and funding be as great as, in theory, it should be?\n\nThe new homes and neighbourhoods could be beautiful and desirable places that would create new models and set new standards for British house building. The park and venues, such as the Aquatics Centre and the Velodrome, could be genuinely public assets, of easy access to all.\n\nAn aerial shot of the Olympic Park as it looks today. Photograph: Anthony Charlton/Getty Images\n\nMost critically all this has to be done in such a way that the new wonderland doesn't turn its back on its surroundings but genuinely connects with them. Early in the Olympic project, the neighbouring areas were seen as destitute wastelands be erased or shut out, and the main weakness of what has already been built is its lumpiness \u2013 the tendency of elements such as the Westfield shopping centre and the athletes' village to turn their back. It would be relatively easy, but a complete failure, to make an exclusive residential idyll here.\n\nAt the moment, hopeful signs are emitting from the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), the body in charge. Its new chairman, Daniel Moylan, declares that he wants the Olympic Park and its surroundings to be \"a very desirable area and we would like as many people as possible to live there\". He wants alternatives to \"the limited range of standardised products\" that large house-building companies tend to produce. He wants property to rent as well as buy, and homes built by their owners. He challenges the common journalistic denigration of Stratford: \"This place is not a dump. There are lots of people who are entrepreneurial and enthusiastic.\"\n\nSensible-sounding management arrangements have been set up for the park and for venues such as the Velodrome, and the Legacy Corporation swears blind that these will not be over-exploited in order to turn a profit. The park, it says, will be open to absolutely everyone, which presumably includes those who might be a bit annoying or unsightly and not good for property values. The LLDC is rightly proud that, compared with previous Olympic cities, London's planning for the future of the site is far advanced, and it has set up an impressive quality review panel to oversee the design of whatever is built.\n\nThe LLDC has produced a masterplan for the new neighbourhoods that suggests a large proportion of family houses arranged around pleasing open spaces, and with an overall coherence that is rare in regeneration projects. It is planning 29 playgrounds and has made impressive declarations of principle in relation to sustainability, accessibility and design.\n\nIn the scruffy fringes of the park there has been a change in attitude. Where earlier plans saw them as places to be obliterated by blocks of flats, the idea now is to make the most of what is already there, such as the artists' studios and small businesses and unexpected bits of canal and workshop. Muf architecture/art, a design practice that has helped lead this change of attitude, is now involved in the first of the new residential neighbourhoods, which is a good sign. \"Obliteration is not in our lexicon,\" declares Moylan.\n\nThey still have some headaches, most notably the future of the stadium. But the real question is whether the current high ambitions can survive the pressures that will come to bear. How inclusive can the new developments be, for example, when changes to housing benefit are likely to push people out of places like this?

coverage of sports featured at the Games including judo, gymnastics and fencing.\n\nLondon Legacy will launch as a 24-hour-a-day channel in November, showing 24 Olympic sports, including athletics, cycling and wrestling.\n\nThe channel will initially only be available to BSkyB's satellite TV customers, but is seeking wider distribution.\n\nLondon Legacy is being launched by Highflyer, the independent TV production company that recently lost its contract to produce Channel 4's racing coverage after nearly 28 years.\n\nJohn Fairley, chairman of Highflyer, said there was an \"enormous opportunity\" to make money from televising minority sports after the success of the London Games.\n\nFairley is attempting to give Highflyer a boost after it was replaced by IMG as the producer of Channel 4's racing coverage earlier this month.\n\nThe London Legacy launch is expected to cost Highflyer around \u00a35.5m.\n\n\"The amount of athletics on the main channels has been very small, especially when you think of all the disciplines within the athletics, but the games has changed all that,\" said Fairley.\n\nHe added that Highflyer had received \"very serious undertakings\" to back London Legacy from two or three companies, including one Olympic sponsor.\n\n\"There is this enormous opportunity ... and no sign that any of the main broadcasters is going to pick it up and run with it,\" he said.\n\nA total of 51.9 million people \u2013 about 90% of the UK population \u2013 watched at least 15 minutes of the London games on the BBC, with many low-profile events spotlighted by the corporation's blanket coverage.\n\nHighflyer, the Yorkshire-based company, was ousted from the Channel 4 Racing production contract when the broadcaster signed a four-year deal for IMG earlier this month.\n\nChannel 4 is expanding its horse racing coverage after winning the rights from the BBC to all the sport's major UK events, including the Derby and the Grand National.\n\nClare Balding will switch from the BBC's horse racing to be the main presenter for Channel 4's expanded coverage of the sport from next year. Balding is also anchoring Channel 4's Paralympics coverage, starting on 29 August.\n\n\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

The goal of London 2012 was to 'inspire a generation', now the hard work will start, in making that goal a reality.\n\nAs a business operating across 20 countries Havas Sports & Entertainment (HS&E) is fortunate to work with a wide-range of sports federations and sponsors from around the world. For this reason we staged a series of daily seminars, during the Games, involving some of sport's most powerful influencers to get their views on the Games and ask: what next?\n\nFrom LOCOG deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills, to International Paralympic Committee president Sir Philip Craven, the message is clear: these have been a fantastic Games, but they should not be seen as the end of a journey; rather the first step towards a future where sport plays an integral role in positively changing society.\n\nAt HS&E our primary function around the Olympics is working with sponsors. Without them the Games would not be on the scale and level of sophistication they are today \u2013 sponsors such as Coca Cola, Lloyds, EDF and Atos provide specialist business services, investment and global marketing support that truly enhance the experience for athletes, spectators and fans watching at home.\n\nBut one major issue now facing brands that are not long-term IOC partners is what role they will play once the Games have left town.\n\nIf a brand uses its sponsorship in the right way, delivers on its promises and enhances the experience of the Games for fans and its target audiences, then Olympic sponsorship can have significant business benefits.\n\nWe are running a long-term study into the effectiveness of Olympic sponsorship and have found perceptions of brand image are on average 25-50% more positive amongst sponsors. It's a cluttered and competitive market so the key for brands is to tell a clear story unique to the association between their brand or product and the Games, and develop content, activity and experiences that are meaningful, make a positive contribution towards the sport, are interactive and add value to the fan experience.\n\nAt our seminars we heard a few examples of this. Firstly from Thierry Borra, director of Olympic Games management at Coca-Cola about the Move to the Beat campaign which has been built around a Mark Ronson produced single featuring the sounds of sport and integrated across all relevant Coke marketing activity and through every channel. A celebration of both athletic endeavour and fan culture.\n\nNathan Homer, global Olympic project director for P&G, discussed the Thank You Mum campaign and taught us how important it is to find a clear position for your campaign and deliver a simple and emotional message.\n\nWhile Sally Hancock, director of Olympic marketing and group sponsorship at Lloyds, talked about the Lloyds Local Heroes athlete support programme and emphasised the need to make your campaign relevant to local communities.\n\nEach of our speakers raised the question of legacy and this is now a major debate involving the main political parties, organisations, sports bodies and major sporting figures.\n\nAll of the sponsors we spoke with emphasised the natural legacy their involvement with London 2012 will leave, whether it's Lloyds educating small business suppliers on how to tender for future development projects or EDF putting the infrastructure in place at the Olympic Park for sustainable energy supplies. The choice now for London 2012 partners is whether they continue to contribute to sport and if so, how?\n\nA number of our guests were quick to highlight the opportunities available for official partners and other businesses to contribute to the Olympic legacy in a meaningful way.\n\nSir Keith Mills shared the fantastic work of the London 2012 International Inspiration programme, which has helped 12 million children in 20 countries worldwide and would benefit from commercial investment.\n\nSir Philip Craven of the International Paralympic Committee reminded us London is about to stage the biggest Paralympic Games in history and highlighted the positive role sponsorship could play in developing sport for people with disabilities.\n\nSue Tiballs from the Women's Sport & Fitness Foundation (WSFF) told us women's sport may never have a better chance to establish a prominent place in the nation's psyche. While former NBA player John Amaechi, who is now a member of the LOCOG Diversity Board, warned that London must deliver on its promise to use the Games to promote further diversity and integration.\n\nIain Edmonson, head of major events at London & Partners highlighted the tremendous opportunities there are for overseas investors every week of the year in London. While Scott McLeod, director of commercial marketing at the London Legacy Development Corporation talked about how brands can play a role in the physical legacy left in East London by the Olympic Park.\n\nClearly there is great potential for brands to contribute to a London 2012 legacy. First they need to judge the mood of the nation \u2013 the benefits of showing you are committed to a longer-term journey than London 2012 are plentiful \u2013 I would also argue that the dangers of abandoning sport at a time when it could take great strides forward are acute. Brands could look like they were profiteering from the Olympics if they just walk away.\n\nMy feeling is that schools and grassroots sport will be an important area for brands to consider along with the smaller federations that could benefit most from the London 2012 platform. Campaigns which blend meaningful grassroots support in the form of business services, cash and marketing combined with an association with some of the high-profile stars of London 2012 could be particularly powerful.\n\nWith this in mind I hope to regularly hear of the term 'public-private partnership' as brands contribute to improved sports facilities and programmes across the country.\n\nLondon 2012 genuinely has given the UK a once in a lifetime chance to inspire a generation. I'll leave you with some words from Sir Keith Mills who told us: \"If you get the right group of people and a clear vision, you can achieve extraordinary things\". Let's hope the legacy of London 2012 is approached with the same gusto as the bid and delivery. If it is the benefits of the Olympic Games will be felt for decades.\n\nLucien Boyer is the president and CEO of Havas Sports & Entertainment \u2013 follow the organisation on Twitter @Havas_SE\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

For almost two months, Britain has shown the world a competence and confidence, a charm and warmth that few of us believed we possessed. The epicentre was the Olympic Park, plonked in a habitually unloved corner of east London, but the vibes radiated out relentlessly over the summer, leaving few parts of the country untouched.\n\nMillions of visitors will have experienced the intoxicating atmosphere of the Olympics and the Paralympics first-hand. In years to come, it might seem like we dreamed it or were temporarily inducted into a benign cult. We once went to a place where everyone was smiling and laughing, we'll tell our couldn't-care-less grandchildren. Where there was no crime or even litter. Where the universally accepted greeting for strangers was the high-five. Where our leaders \u2013 known as Games Makers \u2013 would start the chant, \"If you're happy and you know it\u2026\" and we all clapped our hands, instead of stuffing them deep in our pockets and glaring disdainfully at the initiators.\n\n\"It's like living in the 1950s,\" I overheard in the park one day, \"just with none of the bad bits.\" Even the Indian summer of the past week, invigorating mornings through to dramatic, industrial sunsets over the Stadium, have imparted the feeling that we are seeing Britain at its most idyllic.\n\nBut it ends tonight with the closing ceremony of the Paralympics. Fine, you can go to the victory parade on Monday, when 700 members of our Greatest Team, including all the biggies apart from the future Lord Wiggins of Kilburn who is busy touring Britain, will travel on open-top floats through the streets of London. After that, you need to move on, get back to work. You are not paid to watch sport for six hours a day, unless you're Kate Middleton.\n\n\"It's been a brilliant, lovely, funny, hopeful, exciting atmosphere,\" says the comedian Chris Addison, a regular visitor to both the Olympics and Paralympics and whose wife was a Games Maker. \"People have really relished being allowed to put aside their cynicism. Everyone has really enjoyed the chance just not to be a tutting dick for a change and I know that's kind of my job and I have to take some responsibility for that attitude. But sometimes it's great just to watch a human being doing an amazing thing.\"\n\nAddison talks of it being \"like a mourning\", but you have to spare a thought for those Games Makers, all 72,000 of them. At the Olympic Park this weekend, they did not look downcast \u2013 they are incapable of projecting negative energy \u2013 but there was rueful recognition that a long journey was coming to an end. Most of them applied for the position years ago and they came through X Factor-style auditions that whittled down their numbers from the 400,000 original applicants. They started training in earnest in January and for the past 10 weeks, for those who worked both Olympics and Paralympics, they have often worked 12 hours a day. They didn't receive overtime, or any pay at all for that matter.\n\n\"I don't want to leave,\" admits Mel Tozer, a civil servant who used her holiday and special leave to cover her absence from work. She is with two colleagues, Ibrahim Abdul and Sue Ball, and they are exactly the hotchpotch of ages, ethnicities and backgrounds that seemed to infuriate Tory MP Aidan Burley in the opening ceremony of the Olympics. They are three people that only the events of this summer could have thrown together, but their relationship might not end here: they are talking about applying to work at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow (\"I know the Scottish like to segregate themselves but we're going anyway\") or even learning Portuguese so that they can volunteer for the Rio Games in 2016.\n\nLet's not forget the military, though one suspects that they might yearn for less humdrum assignments than checking tourists' bags for contraband bottles of water. On Saturday, one soldier noted that he had worked more than 100 hours in six days: \"Game face!\" he said, smiling maniacally.\n\n\"Of course what will happen is that the world returns to normal and the challenge is to take something out of it,\" says Addison. \"The thing will stop, the nights draw in, it will get cold and people will withdraw into themselves and their homes. You've just got to hope that something has happened underneath that will survive the winter.\"\n\nIs there some way that we can make the Games Maker spirit permanent? \"Britain has always been like this, we've just lost it,\" insists Tozer. \"There are people on the street, every single day who are willing to say hello to you, but sometimes we forget it. We can bring up our nation, we can show people that we are hospitable and we can do an awful lot in a short space of time and maybe our reputation will change: we are not grumpy and dreary. We're really nice! nice!\" She went up for high-five; I did not leave her\n\nhanging.\n\nNot everyone is distraught that the summer of sport is winding up. Two hundred metres from the perimeter of the Olympic Park in Hackney Wick is a convivial restaurant-bar, the Hackney Pearl. People drop by on single-speed bikes to buy freshly baked focaccia and drink flat whites from locally roasted coffee beans overlooked by sprawling studios where artists such as the Chapmans might be working. If you were a cynical sort, you might speculate that its opening in 2010 was calculated to cash in on the prospective Olympic boom. But if that was the intention, it backfired.\n\n\"The Olympics has brought no benefit for local businesses,\" says the owner of the Hackney Pearl, James Morgan, who has lived in the area for 12 years. As he talks, it's possible to hear rumbles from the park, perhaps the \"murderball\" in the Copper Box. \"Last year we had agents coming round saying we could clear \u00a3200,000 easy for the space for a month and you think, 'Great, we could pay off our mortgage, get in the black.' But in reality we've made less money and I've spent more, because we had to do things like buy a television because otherwise we'd have no business.\"\n\nSome of Morgan's gripes are specific to his industry: for example, that tickets to the Games did not allow re-entry, so spectators could not pop out to local restaurants (\"It seemed almost designed to make you eat at McDonald's\").\n\nBut it is clear that his frustrations are shared by many businesses in the area. Mechanics were told to demand that their customers drop off their cars between midnight and 6am. The local independent theatre, The Yard, closed its doors for two weeks. Morgan, an Australian, has considerable pride in an area that, over the last decade, has morphed from being a near-wasteland to one of the most vibrant neighbourhoods in London. He is also aware that the regeneration kick-started by the summer Games is only just in phase one.\n\nNext summer, parts of the site will reopen as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The project, overseen by the British-born landscape architect James Corner, who developed the wondrous High Line in New York, will include a repurposing of the main venues and a reimagination of the rest of the space.\n\nZaha Hadid's Aquatics Centre will lose its wings and drop from 17,500 capacity to 2,500; a decision on the Olympic Stadium, which can be downsized to 25,000 seats, will be taken in October, and there is speculation that West Ham FC will be the new tenants.\n\nElsewhere, Corner is planning to introduce \"pleasure gardens\", tree-lined promenades that echo his work on the High Line and at least 11,000 affordable homes. The goal is to create an integrated hub of the city, not a moribund ghost town that Olympic sites so often become. After the summer we've just had, it seems the least the area deserves.\n\nAt the beginning of this article, I noted that we will likely never experience such a nation-bonding event again. The caveat, of course, is that on average Britain has hosted an Olympics \u2013 and now Paralympics too \u2013 every half-century or so. By those calculations, we will be in with a shout of winning the bid again for perhaps 2064 or 2068. If you are still around then, consider it your civic duty to remind people that it won't necessarily be a disaster.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347146972098/Great-Britains-Nathan-Ste-002.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0614e2d2b0bc6779a465cbfcdad8bc8f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2012/9/9/1347198638332/David-Weir-celebrates-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82bf69c628ef6fd6438906570a1fb45c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/8/1347111775067/2012-London-Paralympics--006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46e57fcc0a8d23deee3f738161f74424", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347193306568/David-Weir-crosses-the-fi-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=106fd93707d7ffa5d2b22041bed3a545", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/9/9/1347148036651/Oscar-Pistorius-wins-400m-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b02374bdcd03ca38c5ddaafc19416dc6", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/8/1347111775067/2012-London-Paralympics--006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8bdbf51ae431ba1d753cf00257fa1e0", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2CUK+news%2CBritish+identity+and+society%2CSociety%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/9/8/1347111775067/2012-London-Paralympics--006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8bdbf51ae431ba1d753cf00257fa1e0", "date": "08/09/2012"}, "rank_215": {"title": "Boris Johnson takes charge of Olympic Park's future", "text": "London mayor moves legacy chairman to new role after just four months in the job amid talk of internal clashes\n\nBoris Johnson is to take personal charge of the future of the Olympic Park after moving the chairman of the London Legacy Development Corporation to a new role after just four months in the job.\n\nDaniel Moylan, a former deputy chairman of Transport for London, will now lead the mayor's aviation review. The move has been criticised by London assembly members, who say it exposes a crucial lack of planning experience at the top of the organisation.\n\nIt is understood there have been tensions between Moylan and some members of the LLDC board over key decisions, including the future of the Olympic Stadium and the cavernous media centre.\n\nThe LLDC has found tenants for seven of the eight permanent venues and is in negotiations with West Ham for the football club to become the main tenant in the stadium, which will be shared with UK Athletics, a concert promoter and other sports. It has promised to reach a conclusion by October.\n\nInsiders said there had been a \"clash of styles\" between Moylan and some members of the board. \"Securing the future of the Olympic and Paralympic legacy and building on the regeneration of east London is a matter of huge importance to me personally,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"It is vital that I continue to be at the forefront of the decision-making, driving forward the huge task of delivery. The chairmanship of the LLDC will enable me to do just that, building on what has already been achieved.\"\n\nMargaret Ford, the former chair of the LLDC's predecessor, the Olympic Park Legacy Company, was told by Johnson to step aside several months early once she had decided to leave so that Moylan could assume the role.\n\nMoylan, seen as one of Johnson's key lieutenants, ousted chief executive Andrew Altman and appointed the chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, Dennis Hone, as an interim replacement.\n\n\"I have worked with Boris for two years now to bring London's pressing need for a new hub airport to the top of the political agenda. The 2012 Games have shown that Britain can deliver major projects better than anyone if it has the will to do so,\" said Moylan.\n\n\"A new hub airport to the east of London would be the greatest legacy we could create for London and the country at large. That is why I have accepted the mayor's invitation to put the majority of my time into aviation. The time for action is now and we need to bring the government round to that view.\n\n\"I have had the huge privilege of chairing the Legacy Corporation for the last three months, working with its dedicated staff and getting to know the fantastic, enthusiastic and wonderful people of Stratford and the nearby areas. I give up the post with a heavy heart, but knowing that, alongside aviation, the mayor intends to make this one of the great priorities of his second term and is demonstrating this by taking the chairmanship of the Legacy Corporation himself.\"\n\nDarren Johnson, a Green party assembly member, said it was important that the mayor appointed senior planning figures to take the 20-year plan forward.\n\nThe north end of the park is due to reopen on 27 July next year, with the south end \u2013 including the stadium \u2013 reopening in spring 2014.\n\n\"I am worried that Olympic Park legacy will become a bog-standard mix of concrete and tarmac unless the mayor immediately appoints some senior people who have real experience of delivering an imaginative regeneration project,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"He recently lost two of the key people in charge of the project. He also appointed Daniel Moylan against the advice of the London Assembly's confirmation panel, who criticised Mr Moylan's lack of regeneration experience. London expects an amazing legacy to follow an amazing Olympics and Paralympics.

It stands within the now former athletes' village, which is to be transformed into the residential East Village, and will provide both primary and secondary education.\n\nThe first families are scheduled to move into East Village a few months before the academy opens its doors, but those pioneers won't have been allocated their homes in time to apply for places at the school. So how will the academy serve a community that has barely begun to form?\n\nIt's a rather important question when you're creating a new community from scratch. The answer in this case is that the initial intake will be small and limited to particular year groups. To start with, only 15 pupils will be given places in reception class and each of Years one to five, despite the school having room for up to 90 in each year group. This will leave lots of places - 75 in each year group - available for children who move into East Village from next spring or summer to take up.\n\nIn the secondary school, 120 out of 180 Year 7 places will be allocated for a September 2013 start, leaving 60 free for East Village arrivals if required. The academy acknowledges that the initial 120 won't be East Village residents (although perhaps some will be later), but says that proximity to the school will be the main criteria for admission, so they will be local children if by \"local\" we mean living very nearby. If there are more than 60 East Village Year 7s, the school will find room for them anyway.\n\nA further 60 places will be allocated to new Year 9 pupils and this will be capped at first, though it could be reviewed if the demand for places turns out to be unexpectedly strong. Finally, there will be 210 places available in Year 12 - that's the Lower Sixth in old money.\n\nWhy no Years 6, 8, 10, 11 or 12? In the case of Year 6 it was felt that few parents would want to move their children from their present schools at such an important stage of their education, but the academy says it will change its stance if a lot of interest is shown. The same thinking lies behind leaving Years 8, 10, 11 and 13 empty to begin with, as children already settled at other secondary schools might not want to move to a different one, even if they become East Villagers.\n\nAfter this staggered start for academic year 2013-14 everything will become much simpler in subsequent years, with all places in all year groups becoming available, and proximity being the main criteria for allocating places if the school is over subscribed, says the academy. Logically, as the East Village population grows, so will that of the school and its students will become still more local in the process.\n\nThe school will be vital ingredient if the first of the new Olympic Park communities is to have focus, identity and a reputation for success. The same will apply to East Village, with its blend of homes for private, social and intermediate rent and low cost ownership.\n\nA little later, filling the space between the village and the velodrome where the temporary Games time basketball was hosted, Chobham Manor, the first of the park's five new neighbourhoods, will rise from the ground with its 870 homes, 70% of them to be family-sized but only 28% \"affordable.\" The first is expected to be completed by the end of 2014.\n\nCollectively, the school, the village and the manor - all very \"traditional,\" wouldn't you say? - comprise a blueprint for a virtuous \"mixed community,\" the grail of place-makers and modern urban planners everywhere. Three years from now, we'll start to get an idea if legacy theory in this corner of East London is translating into reality.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/17/1342515548060/Olympic-Athletes-Village-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2808c966ffea2a301275e9a9fc267042", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Education%2COlympic+legacy%2CSociety%2CRegeneration%2CLondon%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/17/1342515548060/Olympic-Athletes-Village-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e6824ea678072d54c61fa921878614b", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/17/1342515548060/Olympic-Athletes-Village-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e6824ea678072d54c61fa921878614b", "date": "25/09/2012"}, "rank_185": {"title": "The man in charge of the Olympic Park's next incarnation", "text": "The Spanish basketball team \"trashed their apartments\" after losing to the USA in the final and a Moroccan athlete took out a sprinkler system that crashed through several floors by playing with a remote control aircraft.\n\nBut, all in all, London got away lightly in terms of damage to the Athletes Village traditionally incurred by host Olympic cities, according to the man responsible for putting it right.\n\nThe Olympic Delivery Authority still has to complete \u00a3150m worth of work on the Olympic Village to make the apartments ready to be handed over to developers Qatari Diar and Delancey. But it is the London Legacy Development Corporation, of which the ODA chief executive, Dennis Hone, is also interim chief executive, that is taking up most of his time.\n\nChiefly, the knotty question of what to do about the Olympic Stadium, amid ongoing negotiations with West Ham over the cost of the modifications the football club require. While football would attract large crowds on a regular basis, Hone said that, aside from the stadium conversion, there were also attendant costs in terms of the stewarding and transport considerations.\n\n\"We've had discussions with all of the bidders. The difficulty is that we're balancing the adaptations we have to make to the stadium against the proposals that have come in and the benefits \u2013 financial and otherwise \u2013 that those proposals bring. If it was a knockout [verdict] it would be an easy decision, but it's not,\" said Hone.\n\nThe decision, which has already been subject to endless delays, could now be put back beyond the deadline of the end of the month. Once the main tenants have been decided, a stadium operator will be appointed to manage a programme of concerts and other sporting events around the 20 days of athletics and community use already guaranteed.\n\nSome at City Hall believe that, with the already iconic stadium having proved its worth as a concert and sporting venue during the Olympics, the LLDC should press on without football. But others, including the London mayor, Boris Johnson, believe that West Ham still offer the most sustainable long-term solution while wanting to ensure that the deal is beneficial to taxpayers.\n\nHone, dismissed West Ham's concerns that the stadium would not feel like their own. \"You've got Milan and Inter. You've got Lazio and Roma,\" he said. \"They can dress the stadium between games so that everyone feels like it's their home ground. That's absolutely doable.\"\n\nBut aside from that pressing issue, which has dogged discussions about the Olympic legacy since before the bid was made, Hone is keen to emphasise the progress that has been made in planning for the future of a Park through which more than 10m ticketholders passed during both Games.\n\nHone was parachuted in as the chief executive of the LLDC following the controversial ousting of his predecessor, Andrew Altman, who together with the former chair, Margaret Ford, conceived the 20-year masterplan on which the development is based.\n\nDaniel Moylan, who removed Altman and appointed Hone, has after a matter of months himself been given a new job overseeing the mayor's aviation policy, while Johnson has taken on the chairman's role.\n\nHone defends the changes by saying the organisation is moving into delivery mode, as it seeks to ensure the north of the Park, which contains the velodrome, reopens by 27 July next year and the more urban south plaza, which contains the stadium, is next the following summer.\n\n\"The organisation is moving from a phase of planning to one of delivery. You've got \u00a3300m of transformational works, you've got park opening dates you really need to hit, you're moving into coordination of events mode,\" said Hone, who is expected to be appointed on a full-time basis in due course.\n\n\"If I'm appointed as permanent chief executive, there'll be some changes. But the last thing I'm going to do is wholesale change to an organisation that has been relatively successful and probably underappreciated.\"\n\nThe understated Hone is already planning the works that will remove the main Stratford Gate bridge, across which millions of people streamed during the Games, so that the cranes can move in and begin dismantling the temporary stands either side of Zaha Hadid's Aquatics Centre.\n\nHone insists that the Park, which will eventually contain 8,000 houses, will have sport at its heart in much the same way as the 1951 Festival of Britain left behind a cultural legacy on London's South Bank.\n\n\"This is the Olympics so the legacy has to be sport. We want a full offer of different things but sport has got to be one of the key things. At Eton Manor you'll have hockey, tennis and football. You've got four forms of cycling, you've got the multi-use arena, you've got the Aquatics Centre coming on-stream,\" said Hone. \"Then you've got the stadium. The primary offer is sport. That covers all ages and all abilities, from elite athletes to disability sport and those people we want to inspire to get off their sofa.\"\n\nThe LLDC, which will meet next week to try to edge the stadium saga closer to a conclusion, has found permanent tenants for seven of the eight venues on the Park, which will be called the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\n\"When we open next year, the Mayor might give the impression it will be like Disney. It won't be, it will be much more about events on the Park, such as [the cycling festival] RideLondon. I want to get the message out there that the Park will unfold in stages,\" said Hone. \"The north area of the Park is a much more tranquil area and my worry is that everyone will expect it to be like the Olympics every day. That was a once-in-a-lifetime period.\"\n\nHone insists that, despite the difficult decision over the stadium bequeathed him by his predecessors and caused by a lack of foresight at the beginning of the process, he was happy with the \"route map\" that had been left behind.\n\n\"It would be terrible if you didn't have a route map and didn't have a plan. We do. We have to be open-minded, just like any other quarter of London. We want to have the flexibility for new things to happen. London is never finished, it never will be.\"\n\nVenue vexation", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349890468560/The-sun-sets-over-Londons-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=21ca5d762ec8b3d56e6bd9137797ed55", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Stadium%2CSport%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349890468560/The-sun-sets-over-Londons-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ca90bdbb922827f6f272f7b1c0c83cd"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349890468560/The-sun-sets-over-Londons-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=21ca5d762ec8b3d56e6bd9137797ed55", "date": "10/10/2012"}, "rank_52": {"title": "Designer behind New York's High Line reveals plans for Olympic Park", "text": "The designer behind the much-lauded High Line park in New York has revealed his ambitions for the area of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park that he hopes will replicate its impact in east London.\n\nJames Corner, the architect responsible for the elevated railway track in New York that is now an urban park and the city's second most popular visitor attraction, said the south of the Olympic Park would offer Londoners a new kind of experience when it opened in spring 2014.\n\n\"They are very different on the one hand and similar in the idea of trying to dramatise sequences of movement and experience,\" said Corner, whose practice, James Corner Field Operations, is responsible for the Olympic Park's so-called South Plaza, which contains the stadium and the Aquatics Centre.\n\nDuring the Games it was home to tens of thousands of ticket holders streaming between sporting venues but Corner said that when the southern area of the park reopened it would feel very different from the frenzy of the Olympics. A tree-lined boulevard will open out on a series of \"outdoor rooms\" that will house different attractions, including an outdoor theatre, a play space, a music room and a labyrinth fountain.\n\n\"The south park was always intended to be more actively programmed,\" said Corner. \"It's conceived of as a place that will be actively programmed so there's something on every week \u2013 a food festival, a concert, an art show.\"\n\nThe High Line, which has won a string of awards, has spurred redevelopment along its one mile length and prompted other cities around the world to investigate the feasibility of repeating the concept. \"The High Line is enmeshed in the city and is quite narrow and linear. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is quite an intensive landscape in transformation and is a much bigger area,\" he said.\n\nThe London Legacy Development Corporation, the City Hall body now responsible for the legacy of the area that will meet on Monday to decide the future of the stadium, will not begin publicising the park until nearer the opening date.\n\nDennis Hone, the corporation's chief executive, said he wanted the south end of the park to feel like London's answer to Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens. \"In isolation, each of the things can seem trivial \u2013 a carousel, a fountain feature, an outside room with storytelling for children, tree-lined boulevards. In isolation, you might say 'so what'?

Two-thirds said they had not felt any benefit from London hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nDespite the government promising to spend \u00a31bn over the next five years on facilities and grassroots sport through Sport England, there are fears that local authorities facing budget cuts will slash spending on facilities and that ongoing uncertainty over the coalition government's school sport strategy could undermine progress.\n\nLord Coe, the London 2012 chairman who won the right to host the Games partly through a promise to inspire young people into sport, has taken on a role as a government legacy adviser and identified a \"limited window\" to capitalise on the success of the Games. Following the Games Coe said that \"everything starts from emulation and aspiration\". He added: \"Those Team GB athletes will be the greatest driver of participation we've had in this country in the last 20 years.\n\nThe findings show that two in five of the surveyed clubs have seen an increase in the number of people joining since the Games and eight in 10 are expecting to see more people take part in sport and physical activity as a result of Team GB's achievements.\n\nBut it also highlights fears that they will not have enough capacity to cope with any increased demand. Just over a quarter of the clubs that have seen increased interest said they were struggling to meet the demand.\n\nThe sports clubs surveyed said that lack of funding was preventing three in five from growing their membership, while increased running costs are holding back the growth of 54%. A similar number (51%) said a lack of affordable venues and facilities was hampering their growth.\n\n\"These poll results, so soon after such an amazingly successful Olympic and Paralympic Games, are a reminder that we must not let this opportunity to inspire more people to take up sport slip through our fingers,\" said the Sport and Recreation Alliance chair, Andy Reed.\n\n\"The key message we can take from this poll is that many sports clubs \u2013 who are playing a vital role in this endeavour to succeed on the legacy promise, are crying out for better school links, greater access to quality and affordable facilities and the removal of pointless red tape. All of these things are acting as a barrier to increasing club membership.\"\n\nReed echoed a recent call from Coe for a long term, cross-party plan for school and grassroots sport.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350576758321/Olympic-Rings-Tower-Bridg-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6c81a0fe4daca41e154bd2da66f337ae", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350576758321/Olympic-Rings-Tower-Bridg-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d5e0168550f649194c4ab98000feec0", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CUK+news%2CSport%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350576758321/Olympic-Rings-Tower-Bridg-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6c81a0fe4daca41e154bd2da66f337ae", "date": "18/10/2012"}, "rank_101": {"title": "Lord Coe's London 2012 mission is impossible without clearer thinking | Owen Gibson", "text": "\u00a2Throughout the buildup to what proved to be a hugely successful Olympic Games, Lord Coe regularly reached for a handful of anecdotes that defined his mission.\n\nOne, meant to illustrate the extent to which London's legacy would be hardwired into the project, recalled his return from the 1984 Los Angeles Games at which he won gold. He remembered a long queue of excited young people snaking around his Haringey club, inspired by his heroics but lacking the coaches and volunteers to welcome them. He always vowed that London would be different, but the responses to the Sport and Recreation Alliance's new survey raise fears that history might be repeating itself.\n\nFor Jill Coathup, a coach at Worcester Gymnastics Club, the surge in interest following the inspiring performances of Louis Smith and co have simply exacerbated existing problems. \"Our club was already at capacity before the Games, and although we put on a few extra sessions to cope with demand, these classes were filled immediately,\" she said.\n\n\"We have had an increase in participants, but not in coaches. Coaching courses are very expensive, so this would deter anyone who may be thinking of volunteering to coach. In gymnastics we have to jump through so many hoops, and each of these hoops are expensive and time consuming.\"\n\nCoathup's sport is in some ways a special case \u2013 its facilities are expensive, participants are young and it requires a high degree of skill to coach \u2013 but similar issues are raised across the country.\n\nThere are a number of different issues, from specific concerns over red tape and tax breaks to the funding and attitude to coaching sport to young people in the UK, from the quality and accessibility of local facilities to the perennial issue of linking schools better with clubs.\n\nOne of the most worrying findings is that the upsurge in interest from participants has not been matched by more volunteers, despite the plaudits heaped on the Games Makers following the Olympics. Almost four in five clubs said they had noticed no difference in the number of people volunteering since the Games.\n\nThe government, committed to spending \u00a31bn over the next five years through Sport England, insists its Places People Play community sport strategy is bearing fruit. It says the \u00a3450m invested through governing bodies will trickle down to the grassroots, and point to specific funds to improve facilities with small grants.\n\n\"The Olympics have been a long time coming, we have been saying there will be a payback for Olympic sport and that people should plan for it,\" said the sports minister, Hugh Robertson.\n\n\"I foresaw this back in 2010, which is why Places People Play is specifically designed to address the facilities shortfall. The new youth sport strategy is much more about getting people out of schools and into clubs than any previous iteration of the policy was.\"\n\nBut while Robertson has done what he can to pull together a disparate set of initiatives into a coherent policy, there remains a lack of joined up thinking across government.\n\nThe Sport and Recreation Alliance chairman Andy Reed said: \"We do think it's time for politicians to be more creative and proactive about how we deal with these issues. We are living in challenging times but that's all the more reason to think hard and smart about how we deliver sport and physical activity across the UK in the long-term, over the next 20 years.\"\n\nRobertson agrees, but must also convince his colleagues in the government. Most pressingly, that means coming up with a coherent long-term strategy for school sport as the education secretary, Michael Gove, consults over a way to answer criticism of his decision to axe \u00a3162m in ringfenced funding. Mo Farah's PE teacher Alan Watkinson, among many others, have called for urgent action.\n\n\"There is one significant area that needs attention and that is school sport. We all know that,\" admitted Robertson.\n\nSix in 10 clubs say they already have school links, but many have articulated concerns about the future as the school sport partnerships dissolve without ringfenced funding. \"PE teachers often seem to stick to the mainstream sports that they have been trained in,\" said Kay Holliman, a coach at Black Lion Archery Club in Kent. \"Money should be put back into local partnerships who can link clubs with schools.\"\n\nOthers said it was still an uphill battle to work with local schools.\n\n\"We have done everything we can to get word into schools but it is very hard,\" said Kirsty Garrett, a coach at Sutton Churches Tennis Club. \"I end up running free courses that are not full because children don't know they're happening.\"\n\nThe other recurrent theme among respondents was the pressure on facilities and support for clubs due to ongoing cuts to local authority budgets. Because spending on sports facilities is not mandated, there are fears that facilities will be cut further and that those subcontracted out to commercial operators will be able to offer fewer affordable sessions.\n\n\"We have insufficient sports infrastructure in our area \u2013 facilities are patchy and fragmented and none meet competition standards for swimming or court sports,\" said Emma Back, a volunteer at Winchester Fit for the Future, a network of clubs in the area. \"People are exhausted and need support \u2013 moral, technical and financial. Overworked volunteers and coaches and club committees are of course delighted with the post-Olympics and Paralympics interest, but are also more pressure because of it.\"\n\nShe called on the government to invest in multi-sport faciltiies that could act as a permanent home for several clubs. \"They also need to provide more support through the national governing bodies \u2013 local councils are doing the bare minimum, and this is unlikely to change given the financial pressures they are under.\"\n\nRobertson warns of the danger of being too pessimistic about the prospect for doing what no previous Games has ever done and inspiring the general public into sport, while Coe remains defiantly optimistic and will play a key role as the government's legacy adviser. But for those on the ground, it is clear that the success of elite athletes at the Games and the welcome surge in interest they have provoked has so far posed as many questions as answers.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/12/8/1323371906114/Lord-Coe-005.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ee25716319de2c18dc662ea3ec629205", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/12/8/1323371906114/Lord-Coe-005.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b666c269b55e062465694525a48cc4ee", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2CSebastian+Coe%2CSport%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2011/12/8/1323371906114/Lord-Coe-005.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ee25716319de2c18dc662ea3ec629205", "date": "18/10/2012"}, "rank_212": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics will cost a total of \u00a38.921bn, says minister", "text": "Government says Games will be at least \u00a3377m under budget and promises Olympic Stadium will not become white elephant\n\nThis article is more than 7 years old\n\nThis article is more than 7 years old\n\nThe government has said the final cost of London's Olympic Games will come in at least \u00a3377m under budget and promised the main stadium will not become a white elephant.\n\nUnveiling the government's final quarterly budget update, the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said that at a \"conservative estimate\" the final cost of the Games would be \u00a38.921bn against an overall original budget of \u00a39.28bn.\n\nBut Olympic organisers conceded that over the course of the project about \u00a31bn of public money had been diverted to the organising committee, Locog, for parts of the project.\n\nLocog, which had a separate, privately raised budget of \u00a32bn to stage the Games, received an additional \u00a316m towards the costs of the Paralympics, \u00a326m towards capital works and \u00a314m for Olympic Park venues and infrastructure during the last quarter.\n\n\"The key overriding imperative for government was to make sure that this project worked. By far the most efficient way of doing that was to transfer scope and responsibility to Locog,\" said Robertson.\n\n\"We have done that whenever it seemed the right thing to do and I would do the same again.\"\n\nThe government argues that any funds released to the Locog from the public funding package have been for works that were within originally agreed parameters or were one-off costs such as the extra money diverted to the ceremonies budget.\n\nRobertson said it was \"by no means certain\" in 2007, when the Labour government announced that the bid budget of \u00a32.4bn had more than tripled to \u00a39.3bn, that the project could be delivered on budget.\n\nHe praised the delivery of the Games within the agreed budget, which included more than \u00a32bn of contingency funds, as a \"tremendous success\" against the backdrop of a global recession.\n\n\"The work of the construction and delivery teams, from the ODA [Olympic Delivery Authority] and Locog, has set a very high standard and I have no doubt that London 2012 has set a new benchmark for the management of Olympic and Paralympic Games in future,\" he said.\n\nTalks are also still ongoing between London 2012 organisers and G4S to get it to pay for the army staff brought in at the last minute.\n\nRobertson said the future of the \u00a3429m Olympic Stadium should be concluded \"in the next couple of weeks\".\n\nTalks are ongoing between the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) and potential tenants, including West Ham.\n\nNegotiations with the club are at an impasse over who will pay for conversion costs of up to \u00a3160m to make the stadium suitable for football as well as athletics.\n\nThe London mayor, Boris Johnson, is keen to explore the possibility of using some of the unspent contingency, which will flow back to the Treasury, towards the conversion costs.\n\n\"Do remember that quite a lot of public money has already gone into the stadium. If the mayor wanted to do it, he will have to have that negotiation with the chancellor,\" said Robertson.\n\nThe LLDC and Johnson have said they would welcome a solution that involved West Ham but \"not at any price\" and insist that an alternative option to mix concerts with other sports could also pay its way.\n\n\"This is a 99-year concession we're talking about so we want to make sure that we get it right.

So it was a good time for the Guardian, the Insitute of Directors and Lloyds TSB to gather a panel of businesspeople to look at the ultimate effect. Opinion was sharply divided, both from the panel and from the audience, with the very nature of the London Games and their predecessors called into question.\n\nInitial issues centered mostly around whether there would actually be any long-term benefit at all. Charlie Mullins, managing director of Pimlico Plumbers, led the naysayers after seeing his vans held up in traffic and no increase in business. Chris Daniels, head of London 2012 activation, Lloyds Banking Group, looked for longer-term development; the Supper Club's Jane Gomez had seen little benefit to her members and a deserted London outside the games had hit them quite hard while Jason Choy, managing director of software security company Welcome Gate, was quite upbeat.\n\nInevitably the \"legacy\" concept came up early on, with Daniels citing it as a major plus. Even the part in the opening ceremony highlighting the NHS did some good, with China now taking advantage of some of the services the UK offers. \"We should be clear that there were winners and losers,\" he added, and it became apparent that Mullins believed the losers outnumbered the winners by a considerable number. \"I don't know what legacy's going to come from it apart from for the athletes,\" he said. \"Unless you're West Ham and you get the stadium or you sell McDonalds' hamburgers.\" There was an opportunity for tourism, he believed, but the chance to improve transport infrastructures was \"a missed opportunity.\"\n\nGomez, too, had reservations although had more sympathy with the concept of legacy. The Supper Club, a networking organisation for CEOs of companies with more than \u00a31m annual revenue, had noticed a difference in its attendance. \"People just didn't come into London, mostly because they'd been told not to,\" she said. This affected attendance not only at her company's gatherings but also several of her members, in catering and hospitality, had seen that unless they were on the Games' doorstep the Olympics had caused a dip in business. She acknowledged the possibility of a legacy afterwards, however.\n\nAudience members were as polarised as the panel. One questioner was aghast at the thought that people couldn't understand the benefit when an area of East London had seen more investment than at any time in history. \"The regeneration project [the Olympics] have unleashed is bigger than Canary Wharf, it's bigger than Paddington Basin, and it's moving forward,\" he said. Another, who was in the events market, queried why the Olympic website had not offered any opportunities to events companies such as his. \"I was invited as a business to log on to the website for business, and there was nothing on event security or event management \u2013 I asked, isn't the Olympics some sort of event? There was no opportunity.\"\n\nChairing the event, Guardian economics correspondent Phillip Inman pointed out that new homes had been built, there were more people so in the medium term there would therefore surely be more opportunities? People outside the country were excited, he said. And in spite of initial coverage of G4S and other difficulties the army and volunteers did a lot to rectify that.\n\nFeelings were mixed. One audience member pointed out that drafting the military in to address the security concerns did nothing to solve the basic problem with the selection of the contractor. He also pointed out that if the military were to be involved it would have been better to bring it in earlier, to reassure more people in a timely manner.\n\nThere was also a brief debate on the minimal impact of the Cultural Olympiad; one audience member participating in the arts felt this had been a missed opportunity, and Daniels in particular confirmed the overall feeling that the Games had indeed been about sport overall.\n\nMost of the discussion was about the Games and the legacy, however, and the narrow balance of the more vocal members of a fairly divided room seemed to be positive. Choy had seen interest in his services increase from Brazil, although he stressed this wasn't the beginning of some sort of export boom. Inman had seen definite interest in the UK and its services since the Olympics although Mullins hadn't.\n\nMullins cited other cities in which the economies hadn't improved after the games, although Choy countered this with a cultural point. \"Other Olympic games have often been cold war vanity projects, and there was no real move to make a proper legacy. London has done something different.\" There was an opportunity for only 2,000 companies to supply to the Olympics directly, he said, which he acknowledged was low, but others would be pulled through. \"The point that we're drifting away from is that the Olympics was a two week period of unusual activity and ways of doing things in London. A small amount of organisations benefitted hugely and a number of organisations didn't because people stayed away from London. But from an economic perspective, the next 10-20 years, because of increased tourism, because of increased interest, if the UK gets 0.1% more uptake overall, that number starts dwarfing the investment.\"\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The Olympics was an inspiration for a nation mired in an interminable recession and, for a short time, even school fields became as important as the Olympic park. As the cameras turn away from the glorious procession of gold, ordinary folk, such as school teachers, get on with trying to create a lasting legacy from London 2012. Many teachers, open-minded and energetic types that we are, have tried to harness the Olympic zeitgeist.\n\nOne simple, but highly effective, lesson learnt from the Olympics has been taken from the story of the brilliantly successful cycling team, and their visionary coach, Dave Brailsford. Brailsford believes that by breaking down and identifying every tiny aspect of an athlete's performance and then making just a 1% improvement in each area the athlete's overall performance can be significantly enhanced. His concept of 'the aggregation of marginal gains' has been making transformative ripples in classrooms and schools ever since the cycling team came to prominence a few years ago, but after London 2012 that concept has been taken up with renewed vigour. See Brailsford's explanation here.\n\nWhat is so brilliant about Brailsford's marginal gains concept is that it is so darn flexible. It provides an accessible, precise and useful language for achieving success in a school context various ways. It can make for a rousing assembly it is true, but it can also be a tool for sustained improvement: from students improving their learning, to teachers looking to enhance their pedagogy, and, more broadly, school leaders looking to make small, but highly significant improvements.\n\nAt the end of the summer, I engaged in conversation with fellow teachers, Zoe Elder (whose website is an unmissable wealth of marginal gains goodness) and my local colleague Nic Goodwill, after watching an intriguing documentary about the all-conquering Team Sky cycling team. We then began looking at how we could apply the 'marginal gains' concept to learning.\n\nNow, most tasks undertaken by students have a complex range of skills: from making an original shop front in design technology and learning a field sport in PE to writing a newspaper article in English. All these complex tasks have a multitude of marginal processes and skills for success. Unsurprisingly, not all students have the colossal will power and skill of Sir Chris Hoy (nor the Herculean thighs, thank god!) and therefore they need a little help in breaking down the complexity of the task, making clear the manageable steps to success.\n\nAlready, through the collaborative power of Twitter, the concept has been taken on in many schools in different ways: from being a self-assessment tool for students to providing the rationale for departmental self-evaluation of examination results. One 'tweacher', Lindsay Mason (see her blog), had the ingenious idea of using self-assessment wheels to help students recognise the key marginal gains for any given task. See this video of an exemplar wheel from one of my students.\n\nI quickly embedded the wheel concept into my pedagogy with real success. My GCSE students were soon spinning their wheels and speaking with the self-reflection of a highly trained Olympian athlete - well, nearly. They really did improve their ability to self-assess their learning and take real ownership of their own ambition.\n\nStudents can relate to the success of our outstanding Olympians, but sometimes they lack the application, or confidence, to envision their own success. By eliminating a fixed idea of 'talent', the marginal gains approach can providing a liberating narrative for the transformative power of effort and deliberate practice. Students with a C grade often find it impossible to grasp how to move that one grade higher - an A appears far beyond them. By breaking down success into realisable 'marginal gains' students can more confidently make that big difference through sustained effort.\n\nThe concept of marginal gains is still in early development, like some junior cyclist taking off his training wheels, but, inspired by the idea of an Olympic legacy, teachers can harness the brilliant Olympic success and translate it to the chalk-face of the classroom. School leaders are seeing how it can help teachers themselves on their individual journey towards outstanding practice, while subject leaders are seeing how it can become a practical tool for precise formative assessment. I am busy with our faculty in making the crucial teaching marginal gains, as well as helping my English students build their writing to match Chris Hoy's thunder thighs!\n\nDownload Alex's PowerPoint presentation here to use in your class - it is easily adaptable and contains templates of the wheel.\n\nAlex Quigley is the English subject leader at Huntington School, York.

Evidence of their success continues to reach me almost daily, as people ask were they the best Games in history? As much as it would please me simply to answer in the affirmative, I know such a response would be premature. My reply is always the same: let history be the judge.\n\nI say this not to take anything away from the thousands of people responsible for delivering London 2012, but to draw attention to the considerable importance the IOC places on legacy \u2013 what an Olympic host city leaves behind long after the 16 days of sporting competition are over.\n\nThe Olympic Games are the largest sporting event in the world, and for most host cities they are the biggest and most complex project they will ever undertake. Their organisation affects the entire city and its population and often requires the co-operation and cohesive involvement of city leaders, regional and national authorities, Games organisers, local communities, commercial partners and all the members of the Olympic movement.\n\nThe IOC actively encourages each city that bids for the Games to consider from the outset how it could make use of the event to bring positive, long-lasting benefits to its area and citizens. This sort of planning typically begins a decade beforehand. For example, by the time Sebastian Coe, the chairman of the London 2012 bid committee, spoke at the host city election in Singapore in 2005, the London organisers already had a firm and highly detailed vision of what they wanted to deliver in 2012 and beyond.\n\nIt included: the regeneration of a massive industrial wasteland in east London, providing the local community with world-class sporting venues to train and compete in; new parks and residential areas; better transport connections and infrastructure; employment and business opportunities; sustainable construction; an increase in volunteerism; and the creation of the next generation of sporting champions by inspiring young people everywhere to become more involved in physical activity.\n\nThe organisation of the London Games cost around \u00a32bn, much of which was covered by the IOC and private funds. But local authorities earmarked a further \u00a39.3bn to leverage the Games as a catalyst for rapid city development and improvements, both tangible and intangible, that would otherwise have taken decades to achieve. London 2012 has already delivered on many of its promises and, by continuing to pursue others, we are optimistic that the people of London will benefit long into the future.\n\nThe foundations for London's achievements were firmly built on the knowledge and expertise of previous Olympic organisers. Massive urban regeneration projects undertaken by Barcelona in 1992 and Sydney in 2000, environmental and sustainability standards set by the Lillehammer in 1994 and Vancouver in 2010, and programmes to encourage volunteerism and youth participation by the Beijing 2008 organisers are just a few of the success stories that London used as a springboard.\n\nAs the link between past, present, and future host cities, the IOC assists Games organisers through a comprehensive transfer of knowledge . The organisers of forthcoming Games in Russia (Sochi, 2014), Brazil (Rio, 2016), and South Korea (PyeongChang, 2018) are already benefiting from the programme, which includes a debriefing on what worked well at previous Olympic Games and what could be improved.\n\nThis week, it was London's turn to pass the torch to Rio de Janeiro. The debriefing focused on all aspects of Games operations. It was by no means meant to provide a cookie-cutter template for future hosts. Rather, it is intended to provide valuable lessons that host cities can adopt and adapt to fit their own unique circumstances. We encourage future Games organisers to innovate and expand on what they learn and ultimately improve upon the best practices of their predecessors.\n\nLondon managed to do exactly that in preparing for and delivering the Games of the XXX Olympiad. It may still be too soon to call them the greatest Games ever, but ask the same question again in 20 years and you might just get a \"yes\".", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/23/1353678298370/Olympic-handover-London-t-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=165a1151a50837374b743a6bc5cc5a87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=International+Olympic+Committee%2CSport%2CLocog%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2CUK+news%2CRio+2016%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/23/1353678298370/Olympic-handover-London-t-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c55b96885f301d53bbbbfe6a68d479b6", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/23/1353678298370/Olympic-handover-London-t-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c55b96885f301d53bbbbfe6a68d479b6", "date": "23/11/2012"}, "rank_68": {"title": "London 2012 Aquatics Centre begins transformation", "text": "Three months after it hosted the heroics of Michael Phelps and Ellie Simmonds, Zaha Hadid's dramatic London 2012 Aquatics Centre has begun its transformation from the ugly duckling to the white swan of the Olympic Park.\n\nThe London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) on Tuesday formally took control of the Olympic Park from the London 2012 organising committee (Locog) and started to remove the huge outer \"water wings\" on the sides of the \u00a3251m venue.\n\nThe last outer strip of the two boxy temporary wings, which expanded the capacity from 2,500 to 17,500 during the Games, was pulled away and between now and next spring they will be replaced by huge glass windows on Hadid's wave-like design.\n\nThe Aquatics Centre will reopen for public use a year later, when the so-called \"south plaza\" of the Olympic Park is thrown open again. The operator, Greenwich Leisure, has promised to peg prices to the local average and make it accessible to the community, as well as using it for elite competition.\n\nThe site of London's summer Olympic odyssey is being drained of colour before \u2013 those responsible promise \u2013 being reborn as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nWhere sunny concourses once thronged with giddy ticketholders, bulldozers went about their work in the grey November drizzle. And where concession stands, temporary venues and big screen live sites once stood amid wild flowers there were only endless grey expanses of concrete that looked more car park than royal park.\n\nBut as Locog handed control to the LLDC, which will spend \u00a3292m converting it to an urban park, those responsible promised it would look very different when it began to reopen in eight months' time.\n\n\"As these wings come down and the glass screens come in, what was iconic in Games time will be even more iconic in legacy. People will see it as a symbol of the transformation,\" said Colin Naish, executive director of infrastructure at the LLDC.\n\nRevealing the scale of the task in readying the Olympic site for its future use, it said the initial 18-month programme would be called \"Clear, Connect, Complete\" in an echo of the Olympic Delivery Authority's three-phase approach to building it.\n\nThe programme will clear Games-time overlay including temporary venues, walkways and stands, connect the park to the surrounding area with new roads and pathways and complete the park's venues and parkland to their legacy designs.\n\nNaish said it was important not to lose the momentum generated by the Games. An area in the north near the Copper Box arena will reopen on 27 July next year, exactly a year from the opening ceremony of the Games, including a road that will run through the park.\n\n\"It's very important to strike the right balance between getting this done as quickly and efficiently as possible but also getting the public in so they can feel ownership of the park. We've started our bus tours, which is the first step in that, and the Orbit will reopen next year,\" he said.\n\nLocals on the regular bus tours will see the extent of the vacuum left by the removal of the temporary \"overlay\" put in for the Games and the scale of the job to be done in converting huge expanses of tarmac into verdant parkland.\n\nEventually, over a 20-year period, the park will become home to five new housing neighbourhoods and four new schools.\n\nThe LLDC promised to create at least 30 apprenticeships and said that of the 350 people working on the park, 40% were from the five local boroughs and 15% were previously unemployed. At its height, the conversion effort will employ 1,000 people.\n\nBut LLDC executives refused to give any new detail on the biggest question hanging over the park \u2013 the fate of the \u00a3429m stadium that dominates the skyline. A board meeting next month will attempt to resolve the long-running debate over whether West Ham should become anchor tenants and how to fund the \u00a3200m conversion costs required.\n\nAlready, the LLDC chief executive Dennis Hone has admitted it could be the summer of 2016 before the stadium reopens.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CParalympics+2012%2CLondon%2CSport%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/27/1354032803275/Aquatics-Centre-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25287441b512d340aa3c6518d438a4cd", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/27/1354032803275/Aquatics-Centre-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c8c5778a1c7ceceac8498de6ab5e7db1", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/27/1354032803275/Aquatics-Centre-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c8c5778a1c7ceceac8498de6ab5e7db1", "date": "27/11/2012"}, "rank_42": {"title": "Olympic glory can't save construction sector from downturn", "text": "The task of dismantling the Olympic Park means this small corner of east London is one of the busiest construction sites in the UK - but nationwide, the industry remains depressed\n\nOn a wet and cold morning last week, Vicki Tough, a freelance sub-contractor for Balfour Beatty abseiled down the side of the Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park in east London and pulled off the last bit of the outer shell from the temporary seating stands.\n\nDone with great fanfare, the stunt demonstrated the scale of the task left for the London Legacy Development Corporation, which formally took charge of the park last week. As well as removing the temporary structures, there is a huge job to transform the facilities that remain and turn the vast expanses of tarmac left behind into verdant parkland.\n\nThis small corner of east London is one of the busiest construction sites in the UK. As well as pulling down the Olympic Park, hundreds of workers are busy building the eastern stretch of Crossrail, the \u00a315bn route that links Heathrow to the east and is due to open at the end of the decade.\n\nBut London is very much an exception when it comes to construction. Figures out on Tuesday showed construction activity continued to deteriorate last month, while earlier data from the Office for National Statistics showed the construction sector shrank by almost 11% in the year to September.\n\nDavid Hogg, chief architect of Scottish group Barr Construction, says: \"[The market] is very, very tight. The margins on projects are being pressured and there's a good deal of competition. Some of the biggest contractors are going for the small jobs which is compressing that market. Everything is depressed.\"\n\nAnalysts urge caution when looking at construction sector data, as it is a particularly difficult area to obtain reliable estimates. For a start, construction covers everything from a one-man operation up to multi-billion pound companies. It is also hard to gauge how much of a job is work in progress, as huge construction projects can take years to complete.\n\nPhilip Shaw at Investec says: \"We tend to view the data with a degree of suspicion. Simply because the sheer weakness of the numbers doesn't seem to be borne out by those people in the industry. Construction professionals agree wholeheartedly there has been a decline in activity but they would question the extent.\"\n\nHogg says bigger groups have in some cases benefited from the demise of smaller rivals. \"We've been fortunate in one or two recent situations where we've managed to pick up some work because of the malaise of other contractors, which is a sad situation.\"\n\nBarr Construction built the distinctive, textured white cube of the 12,000-seat basketball arena. Designed to be taken down after the Games, the structure is now owned by its builder, which is considering turning it into a Scottish tennis centre of excellence. \"It's probably one of the highest profile projects we've been involved in, in terms of public recognition,\" says Hogg. \"It gets us out there to be seen as a national contractor.\" He says companies were willing to accept lower margins for the prestige of an Olympics job, but insists Barr made money on the basketball arena, making up for some less profitable work it did this year.\n\nBack on site, the day could not be further from those sunny weeks in July and August, when the park was thronged with visitors. Now, it looks like a giant carpark, slick with rain, the grey and white structures of the aquatics centre and the bulbous water polo arena, blending in with a gloomy November sky. The only colour comes from small figures in high-vis jackets and hard hats that people the scene.\n\nThere are 350 jobs at the park at the moment and will be 1,000 at the peak of the transformation. The legacy corporation also trumpets the fact it is taking on 30 apprentices from the local area, training them up in construction as they go.\n\nBut that is just a drop in the ocean when looking at the national figures, which show a 25,000 decline in construction jobs this year. Here, Shaw says, the ONS data may actually understate the gravity of the situation. \"It's a sector that uses a lot of casual labour. A proportion of that sector will be self-employed anyway. If you're self-employed and haven't got any work, you're still officially employed.\"\n\nTough says she has not felt the impact of the downturn. But then, she has been in London and working on the Olympics. At 28, she has been scaling tall buildings and trees since university, earning between \u00a3140 and \u00a3150 a day.\n\nShe says she is not too worried about finding work despite the economic climate. \"I'd like to think not. You get this kind of work through reputation and there's a big emphasis on teamwork, so there's not that much competition in terms of getting jobs.\" She reserves her concern for the hazards of the job, admitting there are times she gets scared up there. \"In high winds your grip gets a lot tighter,\" she says, rather modestly underplaying the dangers.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Construction+industry%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CLondon%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/12/4/1354619124553/Construction-workers-abse-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95d292133d8823c4d15703669f0d340e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/12/4/1354619124553/Construction-workers-abse-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1a42f3dd4a876f823eae5ff318620feb", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2012/12/4/1354619124553/Construction-workers-abse-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1a42f3dd4a876f823eae5ff318620feb", "date": "04/12/2012"}, "rank_208": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics were good value for money, says spending watchdog", "text": "National Audit Office says Games were a success but there is work to be done on delivering promised legacy benefits\n\nThe government's spending watchdog has hailed the \u00a39bn of public money spent on the London Olympics as good value, but said strong leadership is needed if promised legacy benefits are to be realised.\n\nThe government announced after the Games that \u00a3377m of the total \u00a39.3bn public sector budget was likely to remain unspent, but the final figure will not be known until 2014.\n\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) said: \"By any reasonable measure the Games were a success and the big picture is that they have delivered value for money.\"\n\nBut in its final report on the finances of the Games it said the Cabinet Office \u2013 now responsible for co-ordinating the various expansive legacy promises made to justify the investment \u2013 would have to bring together the many disparate organisations involved in delivering them. \"There has been progress in setting up arrangements to strengthen co-ordination and oversight of delivery of the planned legacy of the Games,\" said the comptroller and auditor general, Amyas Morse.\n\n\"The Cabinet Office will now have to exercise strong leadership to ensure the longer-term benefits are delivered.\"\n\nLord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 organising committee, has taken on a new role as the government's adviser on legacy issues, based within the Cabinet Office. He will report back to a special committee chaired by the prime minister every 12 weeks.\n\nAs well as delivering economic benefits for British business and tourism, Coe had promised to use the Games to inspire more people to take up sport and to regenerate the east end of London.\n\nThe NAO report hailed Danny Boyle's opening ceremony as a great success, with only 5% of the media coverage of all four ceremonies found to be negative. The report said the final bill for the ceremonies, including money allocated to the separate unit formed to cover transport, catering and logistics, was \u00a3110m.\n\nIt found that the final investment in the Games included around \u00a31bn of operational costs, including \u00a3514m for venue security, that were not included in the original 2007 \u00a39.3bn public sector spending package. That \u00a39.3bn had more than trebled from the \u00a32.4bn estimated during the bid phase.\n\nThe extra \u00a31bn could only be found because contingency funds became available within the overall funding package. The NAO highlighted the lack of planning on venue security \u2013 which was not budgeted for and then saw costs soar as a \"finger in the air\" estimate of 10,000 guards swelled to 23,700 \u2013 as the only example of poor forward planning.\n\n\"Most aspects of the Games were well thought out and planned in advance, while planning for venue security was characterised by underestimation of the cost and scale of the task,\" said the review.\n\nThe NAO accorded no blame to Locog for the last-minute security shambles that arose when the contractor G4S admitted it would not be able to supply the guards it had promised, and troops were drafted in to fill the gaps. Negotiations are ongoing over the level of compensation that will be provided by the security firm.\n\n\"The precise extent of the shortfall is under discussion between Locog and G4S, but the Ministry of Defence has told us that it provided 135,000 additional days of military personnel time, at an estimated cost of \u00a336m,\" the NAO said. \"The Home Office told us that the police service provided some 12,000 additional police shifts at an estimated cost of \u00a36m.\"\n\nThe report listed the public sector costs that the government has always insisted fell outside the scope of the \u00a39.3bn funding package, including \u00a3766m to buy the Olympic Park land in the first place; the \u00a3826m spent on the legacy programme; \u00a386m spent by government departments and agencies on Olympic-related work; the cost of staffing Olympic teams within government departments, including \u00a352m for the government Olympic executive; and the \u00a3110m grant made to the affordable housing in the athletes village.\n\nThe NAO said the Department for Culture, Media and Sport recognised that these additional costs were associated with the Games \"but does not consider them to be net additional costs of the Games because they include costs to be recouped from subsequent receipts or spending on 'business as usual' activity\".", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CTax+and+spending%2CPolitics%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/4/1354646471176/London-2012-opening-cerem-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=69909e5918f4d49945f55b7b4f657caf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/4/1354646471176/London-2012-opening-cerem-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1507df06701f0d4d161c8dca381e3fec"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/4/1354646471176/London-2012-opening-cerem-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1507df06701f0d4d161c8dca381e3fec", "date": "05/12/2012"}, "rank_120": {"title": "The Recycled Games: a sustainable Olympic legacy - video", "text": "A team of science and mathematics students from Watford Grammar School visit Stratford to investigate the sustainability legacy of the 2012 London Olympics \u2013 and are set the challenge of designing their own sustainable product for the park from recycled materials.

The shambles of finding a future for the main stadium. The cavalier handling of every aspect of the much-vaunted legacy, both sporting and economic, by business and political leaders. And we ordinary taxpayers are going to go on paying for this five-ring circus for years to come.

I suspect they will be brushing under the carpet any data which may show adverse economic effects or lack of \"legacy\" in sustaining sports participation. The arts sector is constantly being told that soft evidence, such as inspiration, confidence-building, social impact and intrinsic value, are not enough, but that they must show economic impact and value for money to qualify for government support. The enormous weight of qualitative evidence shown by the arts sector has hitherto been brushed off as anecdotal \u2013 let's hope this may change in the light of the evidence coming out of the Olympics.\n\nCatherine Rose\n\nOlney, Buckinghamshire", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "27/12/2012"}, "rank_163": {"title": "London 2012: fears over sporting legacy dull the shine from a golden year", "text": "As an unsteady Bradley Wiggins took to the stage at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year aftershow bash to celebrate his victory by strumming along to the Jam's That's Entertainment, the sepia tones were already permeating the year's golden Olympic memories.\n\nThe tears of joy from Katherine Grainger and pain from Zac Purchase, the triumphs of Super Saturday amid a riot of union flags, the relentless positivity, the sweaty mayhem of the boxing arena at ExCel, the roar of the rowing lake at Eton Dorney, the intensity of the velodrome and the giddy abandon of the main stadium. Amid an austere winter and a sporting public again consumed with the passion and poison of the Premier League, it all seemed to already belong to an earlier age.\n\nThe BBC's event \u2013 attended by 17,000 people including enthusiastic members of the public, athletes, administrators, and the ubiquitous Games Makers in uniforms now fraying at the edges \u2013 was one last hurrah for a year of unprecedented sporting success. Eleven of the 12 nominees were Olympic medallists and the shortlist encapsulated some of the themes of the summer \u2013 from the pre-eminence of inspirational female athletes to the explosion of Paralympic sport into the wider public consciousness.\n\nMany will have spent the festive period reliving the highs of the summer through the BBC's five DVD box-set, while some of those Olympic heroes including Wiggins, Ben Ainslie and British Cycling's performance director Dave Brailsford are likely to learn that they have been knighted in the New Year's honours list.\n\nGolden moment\n\n\n\nBut the thoughts of those tasked with delivering on the expansive legacy promises made to secure the Games, which cost \u00a39bn to stage, have already moved on. They are more likely to be considering new figures showing one-third of children now leave primary school overweight or obese, or Labour claims that the proportion of children playing sport for two hours a week in school has dropped from 90% to 50%.\n\nDuring the Games, there was much talk of the \"golden moment\", of \"maximising the window of opportunity\", of turning \"inspiration into participation\". The much used and abused legacy term has been applied to everything from perceptions of disability to Britain's ability to compete in the global economy. But Lord Coe, who made many of the promises in 2005 on which it will be judged and is now the government's adviser on legacy, has narrowed his focus to three key areas.\n\n\"We're in quite good shape. We've got a bespoke little team working out of a garret in Whitehall. The task I was given by the prime minister was to figure out what the pillars were and I think there are three core themes \u2013 sport, volunteering and promoting British business abroad,\" says Coe. The physical legacy of what will become the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park when it starts to reopen on 27 July next year falls under the aegis of the London mayor, Boris Johnson, and is being taken care of by the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC). Their biggest challenge remains tying up a deal for West Ham to move into the Olympic Stadium, now unlikely to reopen until the summer of 2016.\n\n\"Across the piece, this is not just a sporting issue. If we're talking about the fact a larger and growing proportion of the population under the age of 11 are now officially obese, then really it's making sure you've got joined-up thinking across government. It is beginning to come together.\"\n\nCoe, who is finalising his first batch of reports to be delivered to the prime minister early in the new year and will report to him once every 12 weeks on progress, is typically upbeat. There were fears that, having delivered the Games to such acclaim, he would retreat from the legacy challenge. But having been talked into it by David Cameron as they sat next to one another on Super Saturday, he insists he will roll his sleeves up.\n\n\"It's not for me to say 'you have to do this'. What we're saying is 'be ambitious, set targets'. Make sure that where you have three or four government departments there isn't duplication of effort or duplication of resourcing. People have to understand that sports participation isn't just something that looks good on Sport England figures, or makes me feel good because more people play sport, but we also want some health outcomes out of this,\" says Coe.\n\n\"I want to be able to say what we've achieved in the first year. My reports will be about where I think the pace is good or where I think there needs to be an injection of pace and purpose.\"\n\nHaphazard feel\n\n\n\nBut while you would expect Coe to insist the legacy is on track, others fear the worst. Already, the shadow health minister, Andy Burnham, fears that the \"post-Olympic moment is slipping away\". He points to a lack of joined-up thinking across government and cites a worryingly haphazard feel to some of the post-Games plans as evidence.\n\nLondon 2012 organisers proved there was a direct link between elite performance and grassroots participation when they delivered an upsurge of interest in hitherto minority sports among young people. But when those youngsters tried to sign up with a local club, many faced long waiting lists or a lack of qualified coaches. Toni Minichiello, who coached Jessica Ennis to Olympic gold, believes sport generally has \"missed a trick\" and that athletics in particular faces a \"desperate struggle\" to accommodate those who want to join clubs.\n\n\"If you put them on waiting lists or the quality is not there, the interest goes and you lose them from the sport very quickly. They quickly define their experience of sport as not very positive and they're reluctant to return. Then they will probably pass that on to the next generation of their kids,\" says Minichiello.\n\nThe area where this state of flux is most pronounced is in school sport. The decision by the education secretary, Michael Gove, to axe \u00a3162m in ringfenced funding for a national network of school sports partnerships in December 2010, less than 18 months from the opening ceremony, always looked likely to come back and bite the coalition.\n\nSo it has proved. The \u00a365m in funding that was reinstated following an outcry to fund the day-release of secondary school PE specialists to primary schools runs out at the end of this academic year and there is an ongoing cabinet dispute over a new strategy that has delayed any announcement.\n\nFor ideological reasons, Gove remains reluctant to force headteachers to spend money earmarked for school sport on specific schemes. But others, including those at the sharp end, insist ways have to be found to improve the expertise of primary school teachers in particular. They argue that without giving young children a basic level of physical literacy and making sport part of their lives at any early stage, there is much less chance of preventing them from giving up altogether at secondary school. The so-called \"post-16 drop off\" remains a huge challenge, particularly among girls.\n\nRash of medals\n\n\n\nThere were hopes that the rash of medals for Nicola Adams, Ennis, Grainger and others would provide a cadre of impressive new role models for teenage girls. But without any structure in place, the fear is that the moment to capitalise is fast disappearing.\n\nLabour claims that since the requirement for at least two hours of physical exercise in schools was dropped, the proportion of children hitting that target has fallen from 90% to 50%. They fear that if funding is simply handed over to schools without stipulations on how it should be spent, it will disappear into the wider school budget as harassed headteachers focus on other priorities.\n\nThe legacy for those governing bodies that delivered such success in the summer of 2012 seems secure \u2013 at least in those that have powered Great Britain's rise up the medal table from 36th in Atlanta to third in London. British Olympic Association officials have already begun preparations for Rio and signed a deal with a preparation camp in Belo Horizonte. During the Olympics, the government promised to maintain funding for elite sport and it was revealed last week that \u00a3347m will be poured into cycling, rowing, athletics, swimming and the rest in the four years to 2017.\n\nAll the projections indicate that UK Sport's vow to become the first host nation to improve on its medal table performance at the Olympics and Paralympics that follow is no idle boast. For Paralympic sport, a 43% rise in funding was recognition of the huge breakthrough made by David Weir, Sarah Storey and Hannah Cockroft et al in London and a reflection of increasingly intense international competition.\n\nThe debate is now whether UK Sport's \"no compromise\" formula, so demonstrably successful in delivering medals, risks harming the wider legacy aims. Sports such as basketball, table tennis, handball and indoor volleyball \u2013 all of which hoped for a boost to participation figures from London 2012 and are well suited to urban areas and schools \u2013 have had their elite funding cut altogether because they could not prove they were capable of delivering medals within eight years.\n\nInstead, they must rely on the \u00a3493m invested through Sport England in grassroots sport through governing bodies over the next four years. The grassroots funding body has already been forced to drop one target \u2013 to get 1 million more people playing sport three or more times a week \u2013 and now focuses instead on a new metric that measures once-a-week participation. The most recent survey showed that those numbers had increased by 750,000 during 2012 to 15.5 million, driven by sports such as cycling and athletics.\n\nFigures among 14- to 25-year-olds continue to flatline, however, and Sport England has now been charged with directing two-thirds of that \u00a3493m over four years towards building up links between schools and clubs and trying to engage children in a wider range of sports so they can find something that suits them.\n\nThere are other alarm bells that undermine Coe's upbeat prognosis. Local authorities facing huge financial pressures are bound to further cut sports budgets as they try to balance the books, hitting attempts to provide facilities that are both accessible and affordable to those on low incomes.\n\nFigures seen by the Guardian show that on average local authorities cut spending on sport by 13% between 2010-11 and 2012-13, but in some areas such as the north-east the cuts were as high as 27%. Organisations such as StreetGames, which takes sport into urban communities, and Sported, a charity started by the Locog deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills, are likely to become disproportionately important.\n\nDeserted offices\n\n\n\nThe now almost deserted Canary Wharf offices of the London 2012 organising committee overlook the concrete expanses of an Olympic Park that increasingly looks a bit sorry and windswept after all the temporary structures and \"dressing\" have been removed. The temporary \"wings\" have come off the Aquatics Centre and the basketball arena is being dismantled and shipped off \u2013 not, as billed, to the Rio 2016 Games but broken up into parts and put to more mundane use around the UK \u2013 as part of a \u00a3292m \"transformation\" programme.\n\nThe LLDC board hopes to either come to a deal with West Ham by March, with a scheme to spend upwards of \u00a3160m converting the \u00a3429m main stadium into a genuine multi-use stadium with retractable seats and a full roof, or will abandon the idea altogether and press ahead with an alternative plan that doesn't involve football.\n\nHobbled by the mistakes of their predecessors, stretching all the way back to a 2007 decision to end consideration of a top-flight football club as a likely tenant and press on with a semi-permanent bowl that kept options open, they are under huge pressure to get it right. The wider questions about the regeneration of Stratford, east London \u2013 whether planners can successfully marry provision of affordable housing with making a commercial return, whether the Olympic Park will be integrated with the wider area rather than become an oasis of prosperity among poverty, whether the iCity development that will move into the cavernous media centre will provide meaningful local employment \u2013 will take rather longer to answer.\n\nIt is not only in medals or bricks and mortar that the legacy of British sport's annus mirabilis will be measured. For all the medals and all the joy they brought, if it ultimately fails to deliver on its own \"inspire a generation\" rhetoric it will be deemed a disappointment. Coe, in his new role as chairman of the British Olympic Association and as the government's legacy adviser, insists he will not shirk from the challenge. He is not likely to have time to bask in the glory of 2012 for too much longer.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/7/20/1342792129550/2012-Olympic-Stadium-lond-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9e1a94a2e6e59a82b451ae3cdbeee28a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Stadium%2CSchool+sports%2CSport+politics%2CSport%2CUK+news%2CLondon%2CSchool+funding%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CBBC+Sports+Personality+of+the+Year%2CMedia%2CPolitics%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/7/20/1342792129550/2012-Olympic-Stadium-lond-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e9efe67fc0dfc2279c2ff1671065d6a"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/7/20/1342792129550/2012-Olympic-Stadium-lond-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9e1a94a2e6e59a82b451ae3cdbeee28a", "date": "27/12/2012"}, "rank_72": {"title": "Live Nation strikes deal to exclusively host gigs at Olympic Stadium", "text": "This article is more than 7 years old\n\nThis article is more than 7 years old\n\nLive Nation has secured an exclusive deal to host gigs at the Olympic Stadium in east London, with the Wireless and Hard Rock Calling festivals scheduled for July.\n\nThe world's biggest live music company, which last year brought the curtain down on more than a decade of running events at Hyde Park, has secured a deal to host events in the Olympic Park and Stadium this summer.\n\nLive Nation has struck the deal with the London Legacy Development Corporation, which is tasked with securing the future of the Olympic Park complex in Stratford.\n\n\"Our vision for the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park has always been as a destination for world class sport as well as major cultural and leisure events,\" said London mayor Boris Johnson, chairman of the LLDC. \"The confidence shown by one of the world's leading live entertainment promoters to relocate two of its biggest music festivals from the centre of the capital is a ringing endorsement of out legacy plans.\"\n\nLive Nation has confirmed the Wireless Festival and Hard Rock Calling, which had been held at Hyde Park, will be held in the North Park of the Olympic complex in July.\n\nThe company is also planning to host a number of concerts in the main stadium, with the first thought to be planned for early July.

Among parents of youngsters under 18, the figures are even more stark. Only 17% of parents say government support has increased since 2010, while 65% say it has either stayed the same or been cut.\n\nAt last summer's Games, Team GB won a record medal haul, inspiring hopes of a surge in sporting participation and government action to boost the legacy. Six months on, a damning 59% of parents say they have either seen a decline or no improvement in government support. Only 24% say support has increased.\n\nLondon won the right to stage the 2012 Olympics after convincing the judges that the Games would \"inspire a generation\" of UK sportsmen and women, and by promising that a permanent legacy would be built in schools and communities. Today a separate Observer survey of the views of headteachers in the state sector shows that many believed the promise had been on target for delivery until 2010, but a large majority now think things have gone into sharp reverse since the education secretary, Michael Gove, began dismantling Labour's system of School Sports Partnerships (SSPs).\n\nChris Dunne, headteacher of Langdon Park school in Tower Hamlets, London, described the government's decision as \"an enormously destructive act, verging on vandalism\" and said it was a tragedy that sporting opportunities had been cut back dramatically either side of the Games.\n\nDavid Ellis, head of York high school, said: \"It really is a national disgrace that we are not building on the goodwill, enthusiasm, excitement and motivation that London 2012 generated.\"\n\nLast night, Jowell, who persuaded sceptical Labour colleagues, including Tony Blair, to bid for the Olympics in 2002 and 2003 and was made a dame in the New Year's honours list for her work in delivering the Games, said a cross-party deal had to be struck if the legacy promises were to be met. Previous behind-the-scenes efforts by Jowell to bring parties together have failed.\n\n\"These findings are very worrying but not surprising. But it is not too late to rescue the legacy,\" she said. \"This government has got itself into a terrible bind by shutting down a world-class system of School Sport Partnerships and now pride is the only thing that is stopping them putting things back on course.\n\n\"This really is urgent and I believe my Labour colleagues would be more than happy to sign up to a cross-party agreement that would find a solution.\"\n\nGove withdrew the \u00a3168m funds for the SSPs as one of his first acts in government. Under the SSPs, certain secondary schools were chosen as sports \"hubs\", which then co-ordinated expert teaching across all primary schools in their areas and organised after-school clubs. Gove also abolished the target of at least two hours of PE per pupil per week. Under Labour, the proportion of children reaching this target had risen to over 90%.\n\nDuring the Olympics, David Cameron appointed Lord Coe as his legacy \"ambassador\" as concerns over the lack of a legacy in schools threatened to overshadow the Games. Since then, although there is support and money to provide more help for primary schools, arguments within government over whether this money should be \"ringfenced\" continue to hold up progress.\n\nA spokesman for the Youth Sports Trust appeared to accept a decline in school activity. \"It is, of course, disappointing to hear of any reduction in high-quality PE and school sport offered to our young people,\" said the spokesman. \"However, we are aware of some excellent work being undertaken by headteachers and schools across the country to maintain a sporting culture in young people from the earliest possible age. But we also know that more can be done \u2013 and for some schools, especially primary schools, more support is required. We are therefore pleased that the government is considering a new approach to school sport and await their announcement with interest.\"\n\nA long-awaited report by Ofsted into levels of sport in schools over the past four years, which is expected to show a fall, is now expected early next month after being repeatedly postponed.\n\nLabour has promised to restore the minimum two-hour target and to ensure Ofsted carries out regular inspections. While unwilling to commit to restoring all previous funding, it says it would ensure that schools join partnerships.\n\nStephen Twigg, Labour's shadow education secretary, said: \"Six months on, the Olympic legacy is in tatters. We've seen partnerships that enabled primary schoolchildren to do competitive sport scrapped and the number of pupils doing two hours of sport a week collapse from nine in 10 under Labour to half now.\n\n\"Labour would get Ofsted to inspect school sport, enable teaching assistants to become PE teachers, and ensure parents know how much sport their children get at school. Headteachers say the Labour government was making progress, but it's been lost.\"\n\nA government spokesman said: \"We are working on a variety of measures to improve school sport as part of the Olympic and Paralympic legacy. We will announce our plans in due course.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/25/1359148133831/Children-wave-and-cheer-a-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d005620af50388424e1b021656df4667", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CSchool+sports%2CTessa+Jowell%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/26/1359229385740/Children-cheer-Team-GB-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9251963d37eb587fc8cb96ad8cf2fc6", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/26/1359229094439/Sebastian-Coe-and-David-C-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76343f2b1d5a54eceaa7cb975c641e72", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/1/26/1359212822175/Fencing-at-Langdon-Park-s-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c11038826bd5fa90193be799b5d2334d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/26/1359229385740/Children-cheer-Team-GB-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fc6feb35f97425ef40998d55d3dce8a8"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/26/1359229385740/Children-cheer-Team-GB-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fc6feb35f97425ef40998d55d3dce8a8", "date": "26/01/2013"}, "rank_152": {"title": "After all the promises, where is the legacy of London 2012?", "text": "Six months after the start of the Games, talk of an Olympic legacy rings hollow as the money dries up. It's a lost opportunity to change lives, say teachers and coaches\n\nNear the entrance of York high school, painted in large letters, are the words of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. \"To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.\" It is not a bad motto, particularly for a school that prides itself on its sporting prowess. Along all the corridors and outside each of the classrooms are images of sportsmen and women, many of them famous Olympians. At the start of every lesson, whether it be mathematics or PE, the state school's 800 pupils are set three targets; gold, silver and bronze. \"We really try to incorporate the ethos of the Olympics into every aspect of school life,\" says the headteacher, David Ellis.\n\nTennyson's concluding line from his poem Ulysses was also the one chosen by David Cameron to encapsulate the Olympic spirit in his speech welcoming athletes from across the world to London on 26 July last year. \"It's this spirit that is going to shine out from London,\" Cameron declared. \"We want this to be the Games that lifts up a city, that lifts up our country.\"\n\nEllis and his pupils still feel \"lifted up\" by London 2012. In the sports hall, PE teacher Chris Shouksmith is teaching an enthusiastic group of year seven girls how to play badminton and, as they bash the shuttlecocks from end to end, it is obvious they are enjoying every minute. The school, opened in 2007 as a specialist sports college, appoints young sport \"ambassadors\" as team leaders. Beth Johnson, 14, is one.\n\n\"I nearly cried when Jessica Ennis won the gold,\" she says. \"And the fact that she comes from Yorkshire made it even better. I always wanted to be a PE teacher. Now I want to be an Olympic athlete.\" Another, Charlie Squires, also 14, articulates the wider benefits of sport with the wisdom of one much older. \"If you are confident in your physical self it helps you feel confident and positive in all other ways,\" he says.\n\nEllen Jennings, 13, describes how she moves into her \"comfort zone\" and is \"more relaxed\" when she can spend time on her favourite physical activity, climbing. All three were thrilled by London 2012 and believe the inspiration of the Olympics will be lasting.\n\nEllis has tried his best to bottle up the Olympic spirit to ensure its preservation. But while he can do that to some extent in his own school because he and his staff are hugely driven, he is under no illusions about the future for sport in the community and in other local schools where the headteachers have poorer facilities and may not share his passions. \"We are holding things together here,\" he says. \"But outside there is real decline.\"\n\nUntil May 2010, York high school led one of two central government-funded school sports partnerships from its premises in one of the less well-off parts of the city. With the money it received it co-ordinated sporting activity across a network of local schools and clubs. Shouksmith, herself an athlete and a teacher of great experience, went into primaries for two days a week to run PE lessons for children who otherwise would have had no instruction from a specialist teacher.\n\nAcross the country \u2013 thanks to annual funding of \u00a3168m a year \u2013 other trained PE teachers and coaches also ran after-school clubs and local competitions and built links with clubs in their areas. It was Labour's attempt to create a framework for the future \u2013 and the promised legacy \u2013 from the bottom up.\n\n\"The idea was that if you could get things going in schools first, and connect children to clubs and clubs to children, you would build up participation beyond school alone. It was working well. We were building our legacy upwards and outwards,\" said one senior Whitehall figure who is still working on legacy policy.\n\nBut \u2013 despite Cameron's rhetoric at the height of Olympic fervour last year \u2013 funding for these structures in schools has been taken away, step by step, and reduced to almost nothing by his education secretary, Michael Gove. Gove has also scrapped the target of at least two hours a week of PE in schools and ended annual surveys of how much sport is being done so any decline cannot be measured.\n\nShouksmith's two days a week of outreach work has already been reduced to one as the money has dried up. At the end of this academic year it will end altogether. \"When the head told me he could not fund it any more, not even one day, it was completely devastating,\" she said.\n\nAcross the country links between schools and clubs are now being broken rather than strengthened. Norman Randall, head coach of the Radcliffe Sword fencing club in Nottingham, had been sending five coaches into schools \u2013 and clubs had been reaping the benefits, with rising memberships. \"The Olympics offered the chance to develop those connections and increase our outreach work because the Games inspired so many young people to try sports like fencing. My concern is that the potential to marshal that enthusiasm has been lost because the programmes that allowed us to work with young people in schools have withered away.\n\n\"The link has been broken and the opportunity that was there to achieve a real legacy was not seized when it was there for the taking. Clubs experienced a spike in numbers of those seeking beginners' programmes last September but courses starting this month are generally back to their pre-Games levels. I think a huge opportunity has been missed.\"\n\nEllis says he cannot bear to think about the destruction of a policy that was beginning to change lives. \"On the ground people who are passionate about the positive impact sport can have on the lives of young people have worked creatively to retain as much good practice as possible but the bottom line is that the quality and quantity is being reduced. It really is a national disgrace that we are not building on the goodwill, enthusiasm, excitement and motivation that London 2012 generated.\"\n\nIt is now six months since the start of the Olympics. London won the Games very largely off the back of its promise to deliver a legacy, not just by \"inspiring a generation\" for a few weeks or months, but by putting in place actual policies to boost participation for all age groups and in all communities. So has any progress been made?\n\nOn the plus side, the government has massively increased funding for elite sports to try to ensure Team GB does at least as well in 2016 in Rio as it did in London in 2012. In December it announced a record funding package of \u00a3347m for the next four years for elite sport \u2013 an 11% increase on the previous four-year cycle. UK Sport, which distributes lottery and government funding to elite athletes, rewarded those sports that hit or exceeded their medal targets. Funding for boxing rose by 40% to \u00a313.8m, while cycling, rowing, sailing and equestrian sport also did well.\n\nTo boost community sport, \u00a3493m is being spent on a range of projects over coming years. But while those involved in grassroots sport welcome both allocations, most say one gaping hole remains at the heart of policy. One senior figure close to government said: \"We welcome the money for elite sport and community projects but we ask where is the strategic vision here? To be honest, policy is a hotchpotch. What we still completely lack is a policy for linking schools to clubs in the communities \u2013 that is what has gone and nothing has been put in its place.\"\n\nTo gauge opinions among experts, the Observer invited responses via theguardian.com from people involved in community and school sport, and emailed scores of headteachers. While all agreed that the Olympics had been worth every penny of its \u00a39bn price tag, most respondents said sporting provision was no better or, in most cases, worse than in 2010. Some leaders of local clubs said there had been a pick-up in interest since the Olympics but as time wore on numbers had returned to levels more like those before the Games. The vast majority said they did not believe this government was committed to delivering a lasting legacy.\n\nMinisters insist otherwise. On Friday they announced that \u00a316.6m of National Lottery funding had been awarded to 310 projects across England, although this was not new money. Cash for a national network of school games organisers, who will help run an annual inter-school Olympics-style competition, has been extended until 2015. Sport England and the Youth Sports Trust are working hard with limited resources.\n\nBut arguments in government, where Gove is resisting any money being ringfenced for sport in primary schools, are holding up progress. A government announcement \u2013 expected this month \u2013 has been stalled. Dame Tessa Jowell, the Labour MP and former Olympics minister, is tearing her hair out, desperately hoping that Cameron's legacy ambassador, Lord Coe \u2013 who was belatedly given that role by the prime minister during the Games \u2013 can pull something out of the hat. Jowell today renews her invitation to the coalition to take part in cross-party talks on the future of school sport so the whole issue could be defused politically. The last time she did so, she was intensely disappointed when ministers declined.\n\nPeter Crowe, a headteacher and chair of Derbyshire School Sports Strategy Group, says the biggest problem remains in primary schools. \"It is at this level, I think, that Mr Gove thought, if he thought about it at all, that voluntarism would be sufficient.\n\n\"The fact is, though, that, as across the rest of the public sector, schools are struggling to make ends meet. For our hard-pressed primary colleagues, high-quality PE and sport, not to mention systematic, curriculum-based promotion of active healthy lifestyles, feel like luxuries they cannot afford. Under the previous administration this was provided free at the point of entry from a separate, ringfenced, fund. Now they are asked, should they wish, to pay for it from their core funds \u2013 they simply can't afford to do that.\"\n\nAndy Marchant, who has worked for 35 years in and around Brighton building up local sport and encouraging young people to move from school sport and into clubs, believes levels of provision for young people have returned to pre-1997 levels.\n\n\"The transition from school to lifelong participation in sport can only be achieved through strong links between schools and clubs,\" Marchant says. \"They should not be looked upon as separate entities, but part of the same process, with clubs vital to a young person's school sporting education and experience. In the past year, it has become harder for clubs as the contacts made with schools have disintegrated.\"\n\nHardly an endorsement of a government that promised a permanent, positive legacy from London 2012.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/25/1359148133831/Children-wave-and-cheer-a-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d005620af50388424e1b021656df4667", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/26/1359229385740/Children-cheer-Team-GB-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9251963d37eb587fc8cb96ad8cf2fc6", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=School+sports%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CMichael+Gove%2CSport%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/26/1359229094439/Sebastian-Coe-and-David-C-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76343f2b1d5a54eceaa7cb975c641e72", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2013/1/26/1359212822175/Fencing-at-Langdon-Park-s-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c11038826bd5fa90193be799b5d2334d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/25/1359148133831/Children-wave-and-cheer-a-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93ed0b7639ff194641010db1943466ba", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Toby_Helm,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=efac6e0fb2b25929cd3b691d69c9d2ef"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/1/25/1359148133831/Children-wave-and-cheer-a-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93ed0b7639ff194641010db1943466ba", "date": "26/01/2013"}, "rank_36": {"title": "The Olympic legacy has failed to bring jobs to London's East End | Rushanara Ali", "text": "Exactly six months ago the nation stood transfixed as London 2012 opened with a stunning ceremony. Over the following weeks the Olympics and Paralympics became, to many, the proudest moment in recent British history. London 2012 told the story of what we can achieve as a nation and who, as a society, we have become. And, from the sports personality awards to the New Year's honours list, we've had several occasions to bask in this glory.\n\nDuring this unforgettable summer of sport, there was much talk of capitalising on the golden moments brought about by the Games. But today, many people are still no closer to finding out what this means in practice, or what the much discussed Olympic legacy will look like.\n\nToday the Observer reports that the government is failing to honour pledges on promoting sport and increasing participation. Meanwhile, those like my constituents living in the Olympic boroughs feel similarly betrayed. For them, the most important question remains unanswered: how can a lasting and positive impact on employment and opportunities be secured in these difficult economic times?\n\nDespite a commitment to ensure that 20,000 Olympics jobs went to residents of the Games' host boroughs, fewer than half (9,700) actually did. And for young people in east London the main concern remains jobs.\n\nWeek in week out, I meet hundreds of youngsters crying out for work. When I recently hosted a graduate employability event at Queen Mary, University of London, in Mile End, we heard from many who were desperate to gain advice and the skills to get on the employment ladder. Students, including graduates who have studied hard and played by the rules, told me how demoralising their search for a job was. What makes things worse is that even where the job opportunities are available, local young people are often being overlooked.\n\nAs we look ahead, the government is claiming that Tech City in London's East End is poised to attract investment for new businesses and local job opportunities. It was hoped the 2012 employment legacy project, costing \u00a34.5m, would provide unemployed local residents with jobs after the Games. The Host Borough Employment project, with a budget of \u00a315m, focused on the long-term unemployed in the six Olympic authority areas, including Tower Hamlets. However, the government's failed economic strategy has meant that preparations made for the legacy have proved inadequate.\n\nThe jobless rate in my constituency, Bethnal Green and Bow, remains among the highest in the country, and many are people struggling. Long-term unemployment went up by 26% in 2012, and long-term youth unemployment increased by 55% over the same period. The coalition's Work Programme is failing in my constituency, where a dismal 2% of people referred have been placed in jobs.\n\nLondon 2012 made us believe there is no limit to what we can achieve. David Cameron and Lord Coe are falling short on their promises. We now need leadership on transforming a dazzling cultural legacy into genuine economic gains that will benefit the local population for generations.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/1/27/1359308485193/Londons-Olympic-Stadium-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d06c0b96cc7b3027fd4d8d6f74a2780", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/1/27/1359308485193/Londons-Olympic-Stadium-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3d4c0ae750407e8d834b4adba43e763e", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CLondon%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2CUnemployment%2CSociety%2CLiberal-Conservative+coalition%2CPolitics%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2013/1/27/1359308485193/Londons-Olympic-Stadium-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3d4c0ae750407e8d834b4adba43e763e", "date": "27/01/2013"}, "rank_193": {"title": "London 2012's legacy: diggers and a potential white elephant in the stadium", "text": "Six months on from the Games, the builders are back. But the fate of the \u00a3429m main arena remains uncertain\n\nIt is an eerie, almost melancholy experience to stand in the middle of what remains of the London 2012 basketball arena. Six months ago, it was a cauldron of noise and emotion; now the only sound is the whistling February wind and the drumming of rain on the PVC walls, punctuated by the rhythmic clanking of 33 scaffolders removing what remains of the Meccano-like structure.\n\nThe \u00a342m temporary venue, which seated 12,000 people and hosted basketball and handball, will be gone within five weeks.\n\nAlready, as we stand on the uneven concrete floor clad in our hard hats and safety boots, very little of the interior remains. Eventually, 800 three-bedroom houses will stand here \u2013 about 10% of the 8,000 slated for the park over the next two decades.\n\nIt was long claimed that the arena would be packed up and shipped, Ikea-style, to Rio, where it could be used for the next Olympics, and stand as a neat metaphor for a sustainable Games.\n\nAs with much about the Olympic legacy, the truth is more complex. With the steel contractor unwilling to ship the structure to Rio, and the Brazilians reluctant to trust a different company, it will be staying in Britain, its fate unknown.\n\nSix months to the day since the closing ceremony, that sense of dislocation is repeated across the park.\n\nHome to a seething mass of humanity and epic sporting achievement six months ago, with the eyes of the world on it, it is now back in the hands of the construction workers, who crisscross it in diggers and cranes.\n\nIn Zaha Hadid's \u00a3269m aquatics centre, where 17,500 hot, damp spectators made a din, there is now only the drip of the water that must remain in the pool to keep the system functioning.\n\nSigns order \"no swimming\" \u2013 not that many would want to swim, given the chill that whips around the building now that all seats have been stripped out and the temporary \"wings\" that housed 15,000 people are coming down.\n\nHere and there are signs of its afterlife: a new reception will welcome swimmers to two 50-metre pools with movable floors that can be divided in various ways to cater for learners, leisure customers and serious athletes, when it opens in spring 2014; and a gym, creche and cafe are in the early stages of construction.\n\nOnce the vast glass sides go on Hadid's elaborate design, the venue will look much better than it ever did during the Games. Whether the pool \u2013 unashamedly unadorned by slides or wave machines because they were considered too expensive as the budget spiralled upwards \u2013 can be made to balance the books is another matter.\n\nOutside, on the far side of the bridge that once welcomed millions of giddy ticket-holders, you can peer into the husk of the temporary water polo arena, hollowed out until only the steel exoskeleton remains.\n\nBelow is the canal that hosted picnickers, its banks peppered with discarded plastic drinks bottles. Some of the trees that line it have been literally bagged up, to guard against the winter frost. On the approach to the stadium, the distinctive multicoloured tiles are being ripped up.\n\nThe most striking view is from the velodrome across to the international broadcasting centre, to which BT has just been handed the keys. The company's new sports channel is part of the iCity development, which will be a barometer of whether the park succeeds in becoming an engine of economic growth for the area.\n\nThe hockey stadium is no more, all the \"dressing\", from food stands to merchandise stores, long gone. The area is a huge, muddy construction site.\n\n\"When all the people left, it felt desolate. Now all the bulldozers have gone in, it's almost like we've gone backwards,\" admits Dennis Hone, chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC). \"It was scripted this way before the Games, and we're ploughing on with the masterplan. For me, it's a necessary evil to get to the park in legacy.\"\n\nSoon, the building will begin again. Opposite the basketball arena, for example, work is about to start on a cafe complex and a huge children's play area. Hundreds of trees line up, waiting to be planted.\n\nHone promises that within six months, when concerts are staged where that hockey venue stood, and the stadium will host Diamond League athletics, there will be a feeling the park is coming to life again.\n\nThe greener north park reopens on 27 July and the Mayor's Ride London cycling event will follow a week later. A new, ambitious urban park, designed by the architect behind New York's High Line, James Corner, will be finished by spring 2014, when the south park is due to reopen.\n\nThe LLDC has been wary about letting the public see the park in its current state, fearful of tarnishing gold-plated memories. That will change next month, when people will be invited to tour the site and ascend the Orbit sculpture.\n\n\"We could have waited until Easter 2014 and it was all pristine, or we could try and do some things earlier,\" says Hone, who says the time to judge the legacy will be in a decade's time. \"The opening of the park is just the start; then we'll have to push on.\"\n\nShaun Dawson, head of the organisation that will take control of the velodrome, nurses a cup of tea in the John Lewis department store overlooking the park. Nearby, piles of remaindered Mandeville mascots and stacks of reduced Team GB hoodies are still being sold off.\n\nBecause the Lee Valley regional park authority was involved in the business planning and design of the velodrome from the beginning, he says he was able to \"hit the ground running\" \u2013 in contrast to what has happened with the main stadium.\n\nThe sleek lines of the velodrome remain, but it is getting some minor alterations to make it ready for use by the community as well as athletes. Dawson says the main challenge will be catering for demand.\n\nOne (potentially white) elephant lingers in the room, however: from anywhere on the park, the distinctive lines of the \u00a3429m main stadium can be seen.\n\nIt has been a tale of missed opportunities and overspending, taking in high court cases and industrial espionage. But Hone insists a deal with West Ham to move into a refurbished stadium that will be converted at a cost of \u00a3160m so football and other events can coexist is now, finally, close. \"I'm pretty pleased with where we are, but we're not there yet. I'm quietly confident,\" he said.\n\nOutside the park gates, the Team GB store in Westfield's \"high street\" has shut down and the Prada and Mulberry concessions look markedly less busy than they did in the summer.\n\nAcross the main road, in the more prosaic Stratford shopping centre, life continues much as it did before the Games. One of the challenges for the new park will be to embed itself in the community into which it has descended. It must become at once a local amenity, a London-wide attraction and a national symbol. If the Games of last summer were a marvellous dream, the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park must turn its promises into a lasting reality.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/2/11/1360600531015/Olympic-aquatics-centre-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8316f04a2c75542cb3cfb68a62140e65", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=London%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CLondon+2012+festival%2CZaha+Hadid%2CFestivals%2CCultural+Olympiad%2CLocog%2CCulture%2CSwimming%2COlympics+2012%3A+hockey%2COlympics+2012%3A+swimming%2COlympics+2012%3A+cycling%2CParalympics+2012%3A+swimming%2CCycling%2CBasketball%2COlympics+2012%3A+handball%2CConstruction+industry%2CBT%2CMedia%2CBrazil%2CBT+TV%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games%2CHockey", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/2/11/1360600531015/Olympic-aquatics-centre-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d884ed1a8b74818af4bcea2ea44e0a1"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/2/11/1360600531015/Olympic-aquatics-centre-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8316f04a2c75542cb3cfb68a62140e65", "date": "12/02/2013"}, "rank_119": {"title": "Teachers fear new school sport policy may fail to deliver Olympic legacy", "text": "Headteachers, teachers and sports administrators have privately voiced concern that the government's soon-to-be-announced \u00a3100m-a-year school sport policy may fail to deliver the hoped-for legacy from the London 2012 Games.\n\nThey fear that schools will not quickly recover from the impact of the decision by the Department for Education to axe \u00a3162m in ringfenced funding for a nationwide network of school sports partnerships and are concerned that the anticipated new plan remains flawed because it will rely heavily on external coaches rather than staff PE teachers.\n\nThe new scheme, brokered by the prime minister, David Cameron, and the London 2012 chairman and government legacy adviser Lord Coe, aims to ensure that all children retain access to specialist sports provision at least once a week and has been described as \"the last piece in the legacy jigsaw\".\n\nMajor sports governing bodies, including the Football Association, the Rugby Football Union and the Lawn Tennis Association, will play a key role offering expertise and coaching provision. They are expected to be briefed on the plans on Thursday, while the Premier League has also indicated that its clubs may be prepared to play a role in providing coaches to local schools.\n\nBut while they are reluctant to speak out publicly until the detail of the plans is unveiled, those on the frontline of providing PE in schools say that offering coaching in competitive sport is different to ensuring they are able to provide their pupils with a basic level of \"physical literacy\" and encourage sporting habits for life.\n\nThere is also concern that engaging outside coaches to provide tuition rather than funding PE specialists within schools could over time lead sport to be pushed out of the curriculum. In particular, there are worries that the funding announced will not be ringfenced exclusively for sport and may be spent on other things, and that proper ways of measuring its impact may not be put in place.\n\nThe future of school sport became a political issue during the London Games, with many athletes and coaches calling for an overhaul of government policy. Cameron defended the decision to axe a minimum requirement of two hours of PE a week, controversially claiming some schools met it with \"Indian dance\".\n\nCoe has called the debate between competitive and non-competitive sport \u2013 such as dance, aerobics and trampolining \u2013 a red herring and expressed frustration at the lack of progress. Gove recently held a series of discussions with ministers and other interested parties, plus a summit meeting with sports organisations, in an effort to find a way forward.\n\nWhen Gove axed the school sport partnerships in 2010, an outcry forced him to reinstate \u00a365m of funding to release a PE teacher one or two days a week to work in primary schools. But that funding runs out at the end of this academic year.\n\nClive Efford, the shadow minister for sport, said the government had spent the last two years \"going backwards\" at a time when it should have been seizing on the momentum provided by the Olympics. \"Any announcement giving extra resources for school sport is welcome, but coming six months after the end of the Olympics highlights the fact that the government has no coherent plan for sport. The \u00a3100m plus they are announcing does not replace the \u00a3162m that Michael Gove took away from school sport partnerships in 2010,\" he said.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/13/1363200655898/Lord-Coe-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c902d5455ce67f53772a709877c68831", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/13/1363200655898/Lord-Coe-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4622204e75994a8771e51e7c53d0f42e", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=School+sports%2COlympic+legacy%2CEducation+policy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CPolitics%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/13/1363200655898/Lord-Coe-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4622204e75994a8771e51e7c53d0f42e", "date": "13/03/2013"}, "rank_65": {"title": "Sports and leisure cuts put Olympic legacy at risk", "text": "Guardian research reveals a disparate picture of deep cuts in some parts of the country and a lighter impact in others\n\nOn Thursday, swimmers at Newcastle city pool will take the plunge for the last time before it is closed as part of a severe cuts programme designed to save \u00a3100m over three years.\n\nThe move is just one of hundreds of cuts to sports and leisure programmes and facilities across the country \u2013 cuts the government has admitted could undermine its Olympic legacy promises.\n\nGuardian research reveals a disparate picture, of deep cuts of over 40% to sports and leisure budgets in some parts of the UK and relatively minor ones in others. The government has now conceded the cuts may put at risk promises that the London 2012 Olympics would leave a legacy of increased sports participation and a healthier nation.\n\nAmong those councils planning to cut sports and leisure budgets by over a fifth between 2011-12 and 2013-14 are Swindon, Wigan, Walsall, Essex, South Tyneside, Oldham, Liverpool and Manchester.\n\nIn Sheffield a group campaigning to save a leisure centre that is home to a 25-metre pool and a thriving gymnastics club \u2013 one of the sports under most pressure following the Games, with lengthy waiting lists of enthused children unable to find facilities and coaches \u2013 is considering the case for a judicial review.\n\nIn Wigan, a reduction of 41% over two years is part of a drive to save \u00a318.8m over the next 12 months. It has resulted in a range of cuts, including the withdrawal of free swimming for people over 65 and those under 16, to save \u00a3106,000 a year.\n\nThe situation in Wigan is complicated by the fact that its arm's-length leisure trust, which has had its budget cut from about \u00a316m to \u00a310m over three years, also funds libraries, parks, cemeteries and arts projects, so separating the impacts on sports and recreation is difficult. It said it had largely been able to limit the frontline impact to axing free swimming and transfering two pools to community ownership.\n\nChris Ready, Wigan council's portfolio holder for leisure, said: \"We have a proud history of investing in sport in Wigan borough but the government's cuts have made it more and more difficult for us to maintain all of our facilities and services. Thankfully, the passion for sport that we and our residents both share means we have managed to hand over two of our smaller swimming pools to local community groups. We have also had to make some very tough decisions in other areas of the leisure and culture portfolio to safeguard the services that our most vulnerable residents rely on.\"\n\nMany councils that retained free swimming when funding for a national scheme was withdrawn in 2010 have now been forced to reconsider.\n\nIn Manchester, a city council that perhaps more than any other in the country has used large-scale sports projects to drive regeneration, the budget is being cut by 21%.\n\nThe city council, battling to address a funding shortfall of \u00a380m over the next two years, had proposed the immediate closure of a total of four swimming pools in Broadway, Levenshulme, Miles Platting and Withington. The latter has since been given a stay of execution and it promises three new pools will have opened by 2015.\n\nIn Liverpool, the future of two municipal golf courses, in Allerton and Kirkby, home to junior coaching and school outreach programmes, will be in serious doubt if a private operator cannot be found.\n\nAs with other cuts to libraries and arts projects, Newcastle's Labour-controlled council says it has no choice but to close the well-used pool as part of its \u00a3100m cuts package, and points to alternative facilities nearby, despite a desperate rearguard action that included a \"swim-in\".\n\nFive other facilities \u2013 Gosforth pool, Eldon leisure centre, Outer West pool, Scotswood sports centre and Elswick pool \u2013 are at risk of closure unless alternative operators are found.\n\nLocal campaigners across the country fear that there will be a second wave of casualties if facilities that are passed to local trusts or commercial operators end up unable to survive without subsidy. There are also concerns about the maintenance of pitches and playing fields.\n\nIt is not only facilities that are being hit. In Newcastle, the number of staff employed in its Raising Participation team, its sports health and fitness specialists and \"sport specific delivery teams\" are being reduced as part of plans to save more than \u00a31m over three years.\n\nThe sports minister, Hugh Robertson, says Labour-run councils are intentionally cutting deeper in emotionally charged areas such as culture and sport.\n\n\"There is absolutely a risk [to the Olympic legacy] if local authorities cut sports budgets,\" he said. \"It is not going to destroy the legacy but it is not going to help it in any shape or form.\n\n\"I'll be pretty brutal about this: we were worried there were Labour authorities that were quite deliberately closing arts facilities and shutting sports facilities in order to make a political point, particularly in big cities in the north.\"\n\nLabour forcefully rejects the claim. It has produced an analysis of budgets according to which its councils last year cut sport and leisure budgets by 6%. That figure compares, it says, with cuts of 11% in Conservative-controlled authorities and 17% in Liberal-Democrat-run councils.\n\n\"If we are to deliver a sustainable sports legacy then this government has to understand that it has a strategic role to play and should be working with local authorities to minimise the impact of cuts on sports services and facilities,\" said the shadow sports minister, Clive Efford. \"It is clear that this government does not consider that it has any form of strategic role whatsoever.\"\n\nSince before the Olympics, there have been dire warnings that cuts will fall disproportionately on sport and leisure funding because those budgets are not protected by statute, despite a genuine desire among most councils to capitalise on enthusiasm generated by the Games.\n\nThe former sports minister Richard Caborn considers the landscape to be \"bleak\" and the former British Olympic Association chairman Lord Moynihan, a former Tory sports minister, has also warned the cuts could undermine any gains from the Olympics.\n\nThe recent decision by Sheffield city council to close Don Valley athletics stadium, despite the protests of the Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis and her coach, Toni Minichiello, made national headlines. But to those in Sheffield, a more worrying proposal is the closure of the popular Stocksbridge leisure centre.\n\nIsobel Bowler, the cabinet member for culture, leisure and sport at Sheffield council, said she had received vastly more complaints about the Stocksbridge decision than the high-profile Don Valley one. A group representing the leisure centre, which has until next month to come up with a way of surviving without \u00a3400,000 a year in government subsidy, is considering a judicial review.\n\nThe Don Valley decision has divided opinion. Some, including the London 2012 chairman and government legacy adviser, Lord Coe, who grew up in the city, concede that continuing to operate a facility that requires \u00a3700,000 of public subsidy a year to operate and \u00a31.6m of urgent maintenance is difficult to justify.\n\nInstead, Coe told the Guardian, the council must ensure that plans to upgrade the nearby Woodbourn track, to provide a home for the athletics clubs housed by Don Valley and other community users, are of a high enough standard. That proposal was, he said, \"entirely predicated on a properly resourced replacement track and field facility in Sheffield\".", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/26/1364324983855/Shopping-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e130a0517dd2196ae88b59c93a62cad", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/27/1364379454059/Canned-food-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8145cd532be4c8c099b26665813c41c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/26/1364326012378/Disabled-parking-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e5dae0c1796b68934d9380ff82230674", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/3/27/1364345089400/Susan-Donnelly-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=25c916eb441086eed5503d0c08b45c79", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/2/1/1359737499744/John-Harris-meets-residen-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=76061218e22fe7bc4db380a32fb27d19", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Local+government%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport%2CSebastian+Coe%2CSociety%2CTax+and+spending%2CLocal+politics%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/2/1/1359737499744/John-Harris-meets-residen-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=76061218e22fe7bc4db380a32fb27d19", "date": "25/03/2013"}, "rank_124": {"title": "London 2012 Olympic Park regenerated before opening to public - timelapse video", "text": "Timelapse video shows building work at the former London 2012 Olympic Park, 100 days before the park reopens to the public.

We need to capitalise on that success but there is a danger of the volunteering legacy fizzling out. The Cabinet Office must demonstrate that it is not missing the boat, so that there is a lasting volunteering legacy both within sport and beyond,\" said PAC chair, Margaret Hodge.\n\nThe government is attempting to keep those who volunteered in London involved through an initiative called Join In and plans to link those on the London 2012 volunteering database with local opportunities. But the PAC said those efforts did not go far enough and called for a new definitive plan.\n\nHodge also raised concerns over money diverted from Lottery good causes to help fund almost a quarter of the \u00a39.3bn public sector funding package. She said their interests may not be adequately protected when it came to the formula for returning the money.\n\n\"The Lottery provided more than \u00a32bn towards the costs of the Games but has little influence over decisions by the London Legacy Development Corporation about the timing and value of sales over the next two decades,\" said Hodge. \"It is not clear that their interest is being adequately promoted and protected.\"\n\nThe money from the Lottery is expected to be repaid in three tranches.\n\nFirst, unspent Lottery money from the \u00a39.3bn package, currently estimated to be in the range of \u00a330m to \u00a350m. Secondly, over \u00a370m will be repaid on completion of the sale of the Athletes' Village in 2014. Lastly, up to \u00a3675m will flow back as its share in development proceeds from the Olympic Park site.\n\nBut the proceeds from the sale of land on the Olympic Park site will only start to go back to the Lottery once an initial \u00a3233m has been repaid to the Greater London Authority. On current projections, that is not expected to happen until 2022 at the earliest.\n\nLLDC chief executive, Dennis Hone, unveiling a summer series of concerts and sporting events on the Park this summer, said the organisation had to balance raising revenue from the sale of land and housing with its wider strategic goals.\n\nHe said the LLDC was reviewing its priorities and would produce a new 10-year plan.\n\n\"Depending on the phasing of works, depending on the location and usage of the site, depending on the market circumstances, you get different values,\" he said. \"We're looking at what the best solution is, not just for the Olympic Park but for the wider regeneration of the East End.\"\n\nThe PAC report also said the percentage of seats reserved for accredited members of the press, officials and sports federations, which resulted in embarrassing empty sections in the early days of the Games despite huge demand for tickets from the general public, was too high.\n\nIt said it was a shame that at some blue riband events, such as the men's 100m final and the track cycling finals, only around half of the tickets were made available to the general public and called on future hosts to push back against International Olympic Committee demands for such large accredited areas.\n\n\"Following the extraordinarily successful 2012 London Games, a mood of confidence and pride swept the nation \u2013 and a feeling that this country can get big projects right. Invaluable experience and skills were acquired in putting on the Games. We hope that the lessons learnt from this success will be applied to future major public sector projects,\" said Hodge.\n\n\"Equally the public sector must learn from things that went wrong, like venue security and the availability of tickets for the general public.\"", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344775671840/London-2012-Olympic-volun-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c689a66b56be682b50739b312c600ef2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344775671840/London-2012-Olympic-volun-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=79eedf0e056821fb068304da267c46dc", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CVolunteering%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CVoluntary+sector%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CNational+Lottery%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/12/1344775671840/London-2012-Olympic-volun-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=79eedf0e056821fb068304da267c46dc", "date": "18/04/2013"}, "rank_189": {"title": "Mo Farah returns to Olympic stadium \u2013 video", "text": "Mo Farah visits the stadium where he became the 5,000 and 10,000m gold medallist at the 2012 Olympic Games.

We now have eight permanent Olympics venues \u2013 all tendered \u2013 built on 10 hectares of derelict wasteland; the construction of the largest urban shopping mall in Europe and a \u00a36.5bn upgrade of the local transport infrastructure.\n\nThis success shows the potential for regeneration in the city, but we must not ignore the challenges. While London is ripe for investment, it also has some of the UK's most deprived areas within its boundaries. Three boroughs bordering the Olympic Park \u2013 Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney \u2013 are in the top 10 most deprived local authorities in England.\n\nWe recently held the first meeting of a new committee that will examine mayor Boris Johnson's strategies, policies and actions to regenerate London. The regeneration challenge in London is different to elsewhere in the UK. There are opportunities for land regeneration across the capital, but much of this land is derelict, and the opportunity for development is blighted by poor infrastructure connections.\n\nRegeneration traditionally partners falling population and economic downturn, but for London regeneration needs to take place during a time of rapid growth. London will overtake its postwar population high of 8.7 million by 2016, and approach 10 million by 2030. As stated in the mayor's Vision 2020, over the next decade this will require an additional 450,000 jobs and a further 400,000 homes. Property price inflation \u2013 a 6.2% rise over 12 months to May 2013, compared to 0.4% rise across the UK over the same period \u2013 also makes London's regeneration problem unique.\n\nDevelopment at Elephant & Castle led to opposing opinions at the committee's first meeting. Loretta Lees, professor of human geography at King's College, argued that gentrification of such areas would lead to widening social inequalities in the city, believing regeneration of the Heygate and Aylesbury estates was \"similar to the kind of slum clearances that were happening in the 1950s and 1960.\"\n\nShe was concerned that there was no evidence \u2013 economic or social \u2013 of the trickledown effect that many politicians invoke to justify large-scale regeneration projects. Canary Wharf, she argued, clearly failed to help the local population, stating that in Tower Hamlets \"two-thirds of the people are living in poverty and the rest of the population is earning an average salary of over \u00a3100,000 a year\".\n\nSir Edward Lister, representing the Greater London Authority, saw the regeneration of Elephant & Castle as an opportunity for a proper community to be built in a deprived area. He felt regeneration was essential to allow \"great opportunities for a lot more housing than we have at the moment\", and that concerns over the original population being driven out were unfounded.\n\nThe mayoral team are keen that development brings benefits to the community and believe that locals will continue to be able to afford to live there. \"It is probably one of the few locations near central London where people on more average incomes are likely to be able to buy and to live,\" he said.\n\nThe impact of the current funding model needs close inspection. With \u00a3220m to allocate, can the mayor's current funding model spark regeneration across all boroughs? Two of the three funds at his disposal \u2013 the Outer London Fund and the Mayoral Regeneration Fund \u2013 are due to end by 2015-16.\n\nThe Olympic legacy allowed rapid regeneration of some of the poorer parts of our capital. The regeneration committee's role now is to examine whether this and future projects can overcome the challenges \u2013 including population growth, uncertainty over funding and the need to ensure as many people share in London's increasing prosperity as possible \u2013 to ensure all of London benefits.\n\nGareth Bacon is chair of the London Assembly's regeneration committee.\n\n\u2022 What do you think?

I think it's good practice not to have a tsar because people think it's his job [and not theirs],\" said Coe, before the one-year anniversary of the Olympic opening ceremony on 27 July.\n\nCoe said he wanted the \"four big meaty chunks\" of legacy that he had been tasked with co-ordinating \u2013 increasing sports participation, volunteering, the economy and regeneration \u2013 to have permanent homes in government departments before the end of the year. \"If we do this the way we started, there's no reason why we shouldn't still be reaping dividends in five years' time. If we don't do it the way we've started and those homes and those owners think they've done it and they're on to other things, it won't happen. That would be a regret, clearly,\" he said. \"My challenge to politicians of all political persuasions is that this is a 20-year mission and a 10-year journey. We're only 45 weeks into it.\"\n\nIn one of a slew of reports published on Friday, which are intended to demonstrate the long-term value of hosting the Games, UK Trade & Industry claimed the Olympics had already provided \u00a39.9bn of \"economic benefit\".\n\nThe mayor of London's office also claimed there had been \u00a34bn of inward investment into London as a result of the Games. An accompanying \"meta-evaluation\" by Grant Thornton says the benefits will rise to between \u00a328bn and \u00a341bn by 2020.\n\n\"I don't want to be sitting here in a year's time talking on the same basis. I don't think it's good in the long haul for a unit with me as a figurehead because that's an inhibitor on the way this gets delivered,\" said Coe, who agreed to take on the role during the Olympics. \"It needed the prime minister to grab the attention of his cabinet colleagues and he gave me a lot of flexibility to do that but I don't think this will work unless everybody knows what the ownership is.\"\n\nCoe, now chairman of the British Olympic Association, delivered the speech that secured the Games in 2005, in which he promised to \"inspire a generation\", regenerate east London and leave a legacy for elite sport.\n\nIn the seven years during which the Games were delivered, at an eventual cost of \u00a38.8bn to the public purse, a host of other legacy promises were added to the mix. Some of them, such as a promise to get 1m more people playing sport three or more times a week by 2013, were later dropped. Friday's report will instead trumpet the 1.4m more people playing sport once a week since the bid was won in 2005.\n\nCoe said he was told to focus on three specific tasks, including a mission to rescue a school sport policy that had become the canvas for a bitter battle not only between the government and Labour but within the Conservative party. \"The PM gave me a triage of things to deal with \u2013 to get school sport out of critical care, to get as much as we could in the first year for British business and to get the stadium off the agenda and make sure that east London maintained its progress,\" said Coe. He said that his one regret was that the issue of school sport became \"tribal\", in contrast to the strong cross-party co\u2011operation that he said helped deliver the Games. \"I'm sorry school sport became tribal, that's probably the only thing we didn't deliver in the same spirit as everything else was delivered,\" said Coe.\n\nThe education secretary, Michael Gove, scrapped \u00a3162m in ringfenced funding for a national network of school sport partnerships in December 2010 and was later forced to reinstate half of that money on a limited basis after a furious backlash.\n\nDiscussions about a replacement were derailed by a split between the Department of Health, which wanted the money ringfenced for sport, and the Department for Education, which wanted headteachers to be free to spend it on anything.\n\nIn March, the government announced that David Cameron had brokered a compromise that would give primary schools \u00a3150m to spend on sports-related projects but give headteachers latitude in how it was spent.\n\nCoe insisted the new policy was a good one because it invested the money where it was needed most, but he admitted that at present the provision of sport in primary schools was a \"lottery\".\n\n\"What I now think we have at last is a grown-up conversation. I don't think anyone really thinks that the only way to challenge kids is to make it about winning cups, nor should we assume that every sport out there is providing the physiological stimulus.\"\n\nPrimary school teachers spent too little time learning about the importance of sport and so often lacked confidence in taking PE lessons, said Coe. He said that would be addressed under a new DfE policy that would drastically increase the number of hours devoted to PE in the teacher training curriculum.\n\n\"Actually, there are more people playing sport than before the Games, there's no question about that,\" said Coe.\n\n\"Too much of the conversation is about inputs and not outputs. It is fundamental. The statistic that should be keeping us awake at night is that between the ages of nine and 15, kids become 50% less physically active,\" said Coe. \"And if you look at America, 80% of kids are giving up sport at the age of 12. It is really simple. There are only two things to think about: if the first experience of physical activity or sport is a painful one, kids will move on. So it has to be a positive experience. Secondly, it has to be integrated into their [school] day. If you can't meet those two objectives, you are never going to crack this.\"\n\nThe prime minister said that Coe's report, jointly published by the government and City Hall, proved the Olympics were delivering a legacy in business, tourism, sports participation, volunteering and business.\n\nThe London mayor, Boris Johnson, said: \"We proved the Olympo-sceptics in error when they declared that London couldn't lay on a world-class Games. We are now set to defy the doom-mongers when it comes to securing a permanent legacy.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/19/1374189500972/Lord-Coe-chairs-Olympics--008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14e95554557801a38134104c9d288d23", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/19/1374189500972/Lord-Coe-chairs-Olympics--008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7c5d2a43c99f6304cd40c5c00029a419", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Sebastian+Coe%2CSport%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CChildren%2CObesity%2CSociety%2CEducation%2CHealth%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/19/1374189500972/Lord-Coe-chairs-Olympics--008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7c5d2a43c99f6304cd40c5c00029a419", "date": "18/07/2013"}, "rank_157": {"title": "London 2012 added up to more than pounds and pence | Zoe Williams", "text": "In terms of its legacy, London 2012 throws up a few distinct questions: did it bring in more money than it cost? Did it do anything for this generation of British athletes? Did it lay any foundations for the next generation of British athletes? Did it bring us any meaningful or lasting sense of attainment or unity or cool, or any of the qualities you could broadly class under \"mojo\", that we could either enjoy for ourselves or export to the rest of the world?\n\nOn the first question, this report from UK Trade and Investment found that it brought in \u00a39.9bn, which could rise to a total, Olympic-fuelled inflow of \u00a341bn by 2020. If that sounds pretty speculative \u2013 and of course, doesn't take into the account the \u00a39bn that the Games cost \u2013 I think we could nevertheless agree that the money wasn't wasted. The purpose of these games is a bit loftier than, \"what's in it for us, cash-wise?\" It's meant to be a celebration of excellence, of human endeavour, of finding a way to site national pride within international co-operation and mutual admiration, of building something greater together than any nation could build alone. You couldn't put a price on that even if it cost you money; you certainly can't adjudicate, if a profit was made, whether it was enough. That's like costing your wedding against the value of your gifts, and putting out a press release saying \"we think we made a small profit, but expect to make more, in the form of goodwill generating larger gifts in general, over the next 15 years.\"\n\nIn terms of this generation of athletes, I couldn't help but watch Chris Froome in his Tour de France stage last night (faltering, but so far ahead it didn't matter) and think how much confidence counts, and how much that's generated by believing that you're the sort of person, from the sort of stable, who wins this sort of thing. Future generations, naturally, can't benefit from something as evanescent as an Olympics, when they are growing up under a government that scrapped ringfenced school sport spending and continues to flog playing fields (50 more have gone since the coalition came in \u2013 although things were worse under the Labour government, which sold 242 between 2001 and 2010). There is a bigger problem underpinning this, the relentless monetisation of shared space, on which terms nothing as frivolous as sport could ever make sense.\n\nMojo?

Gazing at a television while overlooking Weymouth Bay, where he had gone to watch sailing's Ben Ainslie with the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, he saw a packed Olympic Stadium roaring its approval on the first session of athletics.\n\nCoe, an International Association of Athletics Federations vice-president who harbours ambitions for the top job in his sport in 2015, had seen his share of sparsely attended morning sessions down the years to know that it meant the British public's on-off love affair with the sport had been spectacularly reignited.He will be reminded of that moment, and of all those that followed from Super Saturday to Usain Bolt and David Rudisha to Jonnie Peacock, when he takes his seat in the Olympic Stadium on Friday for the Anniversary Games.\n\n\"I hope it shows track and field at its very best and that, when it's properly choreographed and you've got the right facilities, it's as competitive as any sport out there for the affections of a nation,\" says Coe now. \"I hope it does take people back a few months to what London was like and how they were enjoying themselves and how their kids were wanting to join clubs. It's a massive moment.\"\n\nMany of the stars of last year's golden summer, already receding into sepia tones, will return to the Olympic Park track where they performed last summer \u2013 Bolt, Mo Farah, Christine Ohuruogu, Sanya Richards-Ross and Greg Rutherford among them. Eleven Olympic champions and four world record holders are promised at the two-day Diamond League meeting. On Sunday Peacock, Richard Whitehead, Mickey Bushell and other Paralympics stars will appear at a one-off IPC International Challenge.\n\nJessica Ennis-Hill was due to compete in the Diamond League 100m hurdles and long jump but is battling injury and unsure whether she will be able to return to the scene of her greatest triumph. Her predicament is typical of many who peaked for 2012 \u2013 often there is a trough in the year after such a soaring apex.\n\nEven Bolt has failed to hit his usual stride this year, though he usually peaks for major championships. He will run in the 100m on Friday and 4x100m relay on Saturday after his return path was cleared by the treasury's declaration that non-resident athletes would not have to pay tax on earnings at the Anniversary Games.\n\nAided by the smart use of music and intelligent staging, a sport that was front and centre of the sporting conversation in Coe's era again reconnected with the national psyche. And among the kids who tried to join athletics clubs that often could not handle the surge in interest there was real enthusiasm.\n\nUK Athletics' chief executive, Niels de Vos, said the Olympics amounted to \"a huge vote of confidence in the sport\" and \"showed how much British people love athletics\".\n\nBut as another wave of cynicism washes over the sport in the wake of failed doping tests by Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay, reports emerge of desperately poor ticket sales for the Moscow world championships. With tennis, cycling, cricket and golf dominating the summer, it seems reasonable to ask whether it was but a mirage. Was it the sport that was reconnecting with the public or simply a symptom of the nation's collective Olympic madness? The Anniversary Games may tell us. De Vos says that the huge demand for tickets for the three day event \u2013 the first time the stadium will have been filled since the Games \u2013 tells its own story.\n\n\"Since the [Olympic] Games we have sold out our indoor event in Glasgow, we have sold out the Birmingham Diamond League for the third year on the trot. From a public point of view we're very confident,\" said De Vos. \"The bigger the event, the bigger the appetite.\"\n\nThe 120,000 tickets for the first two days of the Anniversary Games sold out in 75 minutes and within 24 hours the third day of action featuring Paralympic stars had gone too. There is, though, a danger that the Olympic Stadium experience will be a poor facsimile of last year's expensively staged extravaganza: the capacity is smaller (though still 60,000) and visitors will enter through a building site rather than a sporting wonderland.\n\nYet De Vos is relentlessly upbeat. He points out that athletics is the only Olympic sport with a regular terrestrial TV slot (the BBC is expected to announce this week it has extended its deal), that recreational running is one of the few sports to have increased participation and that a new strategy to centralise its coaching in Loughborough has been a success. Its strategy, on the track and off, is firmly focused on building to the twin peaks of Rio in 2016 and the 2017 world championships back in London's Olympic Stadium.\n\nAs with any legacy discussion, there are two sides to the coin. Local authority cuts are hitting athletics clubs disproportionately hard. Some coaches including Ennis-Hill's Toni Minichiello have been critical about the changes to the structure, while Peter Eriksson has quit as head coach months after replacing Charles van Commenee.\n\nCommercially UKA has been forced to admit that a new portfolio sponsorship strategy to replace the title sponsor Aviva may not realise the same income despite the huge boost of London 2012.\n\nAs far as the British team goes, De Vos is buoyed by a new generation of stars \u2013 Adam Gemili, James Dasaolu, Holly Bleasdale \u2013 and says there is more strength in depth. \"It is true to say there was a gap between the very top performers and the next level\" in London, he says, but he believes that is changing.\n\nUK Athletics is determined to make the most of the opportunity provided by a stadium that, according to Coe's vision, will provide a top-class home for track and field for the next 50 years or more. Whether it will be able to fill it on a consistent basis is the great unanswered question.\n\nBy chance it has worked out well for London's Mayor Boris Johnson: he can fling open the gates of the stadium again less than 11 months after the Paralympic closing ceremony and avoid the impression that it has been mothballed. But after the last spectators leave on Sunday it will shut its doors for an expensive conversion into a dual-use home for athletics and football's West Ham United, losing its distinctive floodlights in the process.\n\nThe next time it will be full is for the Rugby World Cup in 2015. By then it may be clear whether London 2012 was a bright new day for athletics in Britain or merely a false dawn.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/7/19/1374240409760/Mo-Farah-and-Usain-Bolt-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bfe061b91d0ae4a1cae757570833b204", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Athletics%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CDisability+and+sport%2CSport%2CSebastian+Coe%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/7/19/1374240409760/Mo-Farah-and-Usain-Bolt-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c735eef7bf7a7ae4a5fbb133330462d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/7/19/1374240409760/Mo-Farah-and-Usain-Bolt-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c735eef7bf7a7ae4a5fbb133330462d", "date": "20/07/2013"}, "rank_14": {"title": "London's Olympics legacy faces early disqualification", "text": "In 2006, as London bathed in the afterglow of winning the bid for the 2012 Olympics, Sebastian Coe announced: \"Legacy is probably nine-tenths of what this process is about \u2013 not just 16 days of sport.\"\n\nPresented as a benevolent behemoth of fast-track regeneration, the Games were supposed to leave behind a shiny new world of 12,000 homes and 10,000 jobs, set amid the rolling hills of the largest new park in Europe. It would be the miracle cure for the maligned East End, cleansing a swath of the Lower Lea valley \u2013 a site conveniently branded as a toxic dumping ground, at the nexus of London's poorest boroughs.\n\nOn Friday, reports were published declaring the legacy to be a triumph for UK tourism, sports participation, volunteering and business. But what is the physical reality on the ground? One year on, and with \u00a311bn of public money spent on the Olympics, the first part of the park will reopen this weekend. With national cynicism no longer suspended, now that the collective frisson of watching our Lycra-clad heroes has faded, how is the promised bounty shaping up?\n\nWalking down Stratford High Street, along the south-east border of the Olympic park, the signs are not auspicious. At every junction of this roaring A-road sprouts a steroidal tower, each clad in ever more lurid colours, transforming the street into a gauntlet of competing ambitions. Looming over adjacent council estates, these brash totems are a monument to Olympian greed. Marketed with the blandly aspirational names of Velocity, Aurora and Icona, they reach their peak at the purple 43-storey shaft of the Stratford Halo. Strip away all the festive colours, though, and you'll find that these are actually mean-minded silos of tightly packed one-bedroom flats, mostly sold overseas for buy-to-let.\n\nLike a physical bar chart, their bloated bulk stands as a diagram of the vastly inflated land values whipped up by the Olympic gold rush. Developers swarmed in when the area was earmarked as the sacred site. Paying over the odds, each was determined to build what they imagined would be the ultimate gateway to the Games. Inevitably, they failed. The real gateway to the Olympic park had been determined long before \u2013 in the form of a gigantic shopping mall. Westfield represents part of a pre-existing plan for Stratford City, imagined as a glamorous new \"metropolitan centre\" built around the Stratford international rail hub (just two hours from Brussels). But the plan hit the rocks and was divided into separate hands, split into an inward-looking mall on one side of the tracks and the eastern bloc-style flats of the athletes' village on the other.\n\nThis commercial compromise destroyed any idea of an integrated \"city\" right from the start. Nor did the financial crisis help: the housing developers had to be bailed out by the public purse to the tune of \u00a31bn, and the results have since been sold on to the Qatari royal family for about half that. The sole precondition is that half the flats be let for \"affordable\" rent (80% of market rate).\n\nWith its wide, tree-lined streets and its endless facades of beige concrete, the housing area, now christened East Village, feels peculiarly soulless. It's not just the rigid, coarse and repetitive courtyard blocks that rise like 10-storey cliff-faces \u2013 it's the gaping boulevards that sweep between them. There's little sense of human scale. The original plan was to roll out a similar grid of muscular blocks right across the park, like our own slice of Benidorm. But, remarkably, common sense has prevailed.\n\n\"There was a moment when people said, 'Hey, shouldn't this look a bit more like London?'\" says Canadian architect Kathryn Firth, chief of design at the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), the mayoral machine in charge of the future of the site and its surroundings. \"The feedback from public consultation was that it all looked like a very alien place.\"\n\nFormer legacy chiefs had spoken with rapture of replicating places like Belgravia and Maida Vale in the Lea valley, analogies that did not sit particularly happily with the terraces of Leyton and the warehouses of Hackney Wick. \"I think it's a bit arrogant to say we're creating a bit of South Ken here,\" says Firth. \"We're in east London, so we should learn from our neighbours.\"\n\nConsequently, the plan has been reconfigured to take in a mixture of traditional London typologies. Now scaled back to a total of 8,000 homes, the \"legacy communities\" will be formed from familiar things: terraces and squares, mansion blocks and mews houses. They will sit among a surreal landscape of Olympic fragments from the elegant swoop of the velodrome to the skeleton of the main stadium and the hulking shed of the media centre \u2013 the only one changing its use. Reborn as iCity, it's a place for start-ups, media companies and a satellite of Loughborough University.\n\nFlats by the basketball arena, which will be the site of the first \u2018legacy neighbourhood\u2019, Chobham Manor. Photograph: Getty\n\nThere is a sensible design code for each of the new neighbourhoods, covering general layouts, materials and street character: stone, bricks and things that last will be favoured over the recent vernacular of novelty shapes decorated with jazzy shades of plastic. And areas will be tuned according to their context. Over the canal from Hackney Wick, a land of artists' studios and fragments of industry, there will be buildings with workshops and yards. Chobham Manor, closer to suburban Leyton, will have bigger, family-sized homes with gardens, while to the south, nearer Stratford, a world of waterside apartments will prevail.\n\nFirth's colleague Eleanor Fawcett sums up the ethos: \"It should be like the surrounding neighbourhoods spilling in,\" she says. \"The objective is that no one will ever know where the fence was.\" Given that the site is cut off on all sides by canals, railway cuttings and elevated roads \u2013 a secure island that made it particularly attractive to Olympic planners \u2013 this will be a struggle. Still, Fawcett has spent the last few years co-ordinating projects that try to stitch the severed site back into its hinterland, both physically and socially. \"In some places, it's as simple as moving fences to unlock stretches of footpaths on the river,\" she says. \"In others, it's about funding temporary uses, things like skate parks and studios, that can spread into the park, to inform the nature of the permanent developments.\"\n\nFirth and Fawcett make a convincing duo. They bring a welcome voice of sanity after a disastrous failure of planning intelligence about how to make a coherent place out of this ragbag of parts. Yet, while their words and drawings may be reassuring, there is still precious little evidence that their hopes will come to fruition.\n\nThe LLDC has the unique power to insist on quality, acting as both landowner in the park and planning authority for 500 or so hectares around it (a model similar to Thatcher's London Docklands Development Corporation (http://www.lddc-history.org.uk/), responsible for Canary Wharf). Learning from the great estates like Grosvenor and Cadogan in the West End, the corporation will retain ownership of the land and rent chunks to development partners on long-term leases, with all designs overseen by a panel of the country's more thoughtful housing architects, including Peter Barber and Alex Ely.\n\nThere is also the much-declared political will to experiment with self-build, co-housing and community land trusts, meaning the park could become a test bed for new kinds of housing. But it would all require a brave leap of faith \u2013 something the LLDC's target-driven constitution is unlikely to allow. With the onerous obligation to make some sort of return, given the cost of the Games, there is constant pressure for commercial viability: because of the cost of improving infrastructure, the target for 35% affordable housing, not to mention the strict design codes, anything beyond the market norm will be difficult to achieve. Meanwhile, mayor Boris Johnson \u2013 self-appointed chair of the legacy corporation \u2013 is now pushing to accelerate what was a 20-year plan, hungry for visible results and political capital.\n\nHe would do better to slow down. Outside the park, developers continue to try their luck, spurred on by what others have got away with. Stock Woolstencroft, architects of the dismal Stratford towers, are attempting to continue their march of mediocrity with schemes on the other side of the park. In Fish Island, to the west, they have submitted an application for 15 buildings of up to 14 storeys (in an area allowing a maximum of six) clothed in a random livery of cheap cladding. It was slammed by the review panel, but the response to such schemes will be the test of the corporation's planning powers, and how far it is prepared to insist on good design.\n\nDespite all the blunders around the edge of the site, there are reasons to be optimistic. The communities within could yet be successful. But an uneasy fact remains: that building on the site of a global event \u2013 making workable streets from tarmac wastes and weaving housing around velodromes \u2013 is a difficult and expensive way of producing a good city.

Sport England cites 106,600 taking part in track and field at least once a week during the year since April 2012, an increase of 28% on the year before the Olympics. There is also an undoubted UK boom in road running and jogging, although the number taking part fell after the Olympics, from 1.92m from April 2011-12 to 1.87m in the year to April 2013.\n\nThe number of adult competitors in athletics events is much lower, calculated at just under 20,000 by the statistician Rob Whittingham, author of the British Athletics Annual.\n\nNiels de Vos, the chief executive of UK Athletics, was himself a sceptic about whether, as the British bid claimed, an Olympics could lead to young people taking part in more sport. Speaking at Keble College, Oxford, shortly after the London Games, De Vos said: \"That was the promise Lord Coe made, and actually no Olympics has done that. That's where I think the movement has to hold its hands up and say: there is no evidence that this investment creates a future legacy, a future generation that does more sport.\"\n\nNow De Vos points to the increases compiled by Sport England, and more young people showing an interest at club level, and says he underestimated the impact the Olympics would have. UK Athletics has \u00a322m over the next four years to spend on grassroots initiatives.\n\nNevertheless De Vos stands by his assertions, agreeing with Minichiello that much greater investment is needed in schools and in facilities if the British sporting experience is to be transformed. Nationwide, swingeing cuts to local authority budgets are putting council-owned tracks under great financial pressure, epitomised by the imminent closure of Sheffield's Don Valley stadium, where Ennis trained.\n\n\"I believe there has been a good athletics legacy, certainly in the Olympic Stadium, in public interest, and in participation,\" De Vos says. \"But I would like to see our country becoming like continental Europe, where every small town has its own excellent sports facilities.\"\n\nCycling by William Fotheringham\n\nChris Froome's Tour de France victory is the tip of the iceberg as far as cycling in Britain is concerned. The sport is on the crest of a wave, with numbers increasing across the board and the cycle industry continuing to look recession proof. In truth this is not a London Olympic legacy but part of a groundswell of increasing numbers that has its origins in Beijing.\n\nThere has been no drop in the medal haul at international level, in spite of the retirement of Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, with Becky James, left, taking a hat-trick of gold medals in the women's sprint world championships in February and Jason Kenny taking gold in the keirin, while new talents have emerged such as Elinor Barker in the women's team pursuit and Simon Yates, the men's points race world champion.\n\nAt home, the cycling calendar continues to expand at a rapid rate, although the historical decline in the number of high-class road events has not been reversed. Below obvious legacy events like the Prudential Ride London-Surrey Classic in a couple of weeks, expansion is mainly in racing on circuits closed to traffic, where fields exceed 100 in some events.\n\nWomen's events are buoyant at grassroots level, and a major women's stage race is being planned for next year, run by the current Tour of Britain organisers, filling a significant gap in the calendar. Record numbers of youngsters have been competing in national youth events, with over 100 in some under-16 boys' races; clearly there are many aspiring Cavendishes and Wigginses out there.\n\nThe numbers speak volumes. Earlier this year, membership of the governing body, British Cycling, hit 75,000, an increase of 50% since Bradley Wiggins's Tour de France win in 2012. The number of cycling clubs has increased by 100 in the last 12 months to over 1,700, while numbers are up strongly in both competitive and non-competitive events. Infrastructure continues to expand, with the velodrome in Glasgow opening last autumn, the London \"Pringle\" going public this winter and a new indoor track being built in the East Midlands.\n\nThere are a few discordant notes though. It is likely that the covered velodromes in England and Wales will be operating to capacity for much of the time, even when London opens to the public this winter, and experienced racers complain that the influx of uncoached newbies without a club background has caused an increase in accidents. The new clubs on the block include a large number of sponsored teams who do not actually promote races.\n\nMost seriously, however, fatalities among cyclists using Britain's roads rose 10% in 2012. Worryingly for the governing body, there have been two deaths of cyclists riding road races this year and one of a road race motorcycle marshal, after a lengthy period without a single fatality. Those statistics imply that the medals and participation statistics have not made the roads any safer for those on two wheels.\n\nRowing by James Riach\n\nThe top-funded sport in Britain after a nine-medal haul at the Games, rowing now finds itself trying to create sufficient infrastructure to capitalise on the significant surge in participation at grassroots level.\n\nUK Sport increased its funding from \u00a327.3m to \u00a332.6m following the remarkable success at Eton Dorney during the Olympics, while Sport England will contribute \u00a38.2m at grassroots level between 2013 and 2017.\n\nBritain's rowers topped the overall standings at this year's World Cup, staged in Sydney, Eton Dorney and Lucerne. The competition drew in record crowds when returning to the scene of London 2012.\n\nSince August last year approximately 11,500 people have bought their first British Rowing membership, with 80,000-90,000 amateurs participating in the sport at least once every week.\n\nBritish Rowing is attempting to build on the success of the Games by diversifying the places where people can participate. The organisation has taken the sport to watersport centres across the country to offer rowing alongside sailing and canoeing, while it has also formed a link with the Sea Cadets and Scouts.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Olympics, 32,000 people signed up to \"learn to row\" courses across Britain but the challenge is now keeping them in the sport.\n\nSimon Dickie, youth and community manager for British Rowing, says: \"We have got more demand than we are capable of supplying. Our clubs are reporting massive demand for learn to row courses from kids and adults from all parts of the country. The future looks bright.\n\n\"The most important thing for us is to diversify the range of places where people can go rowing. There is still work to be done.\"\n\nFemale participation has been growing steadily since 2012. Sport England estimates the number of women rowing at least once a week is 11,000, while British Rowing has particularly focused its attention on attracting more youngsters to the water.\n\nApproximately 55% of British Rowing members are under 22, with the organisation hoping that the heroics of Katherine Grainger, below, Anna Watkins et al last year can continue to inspire a generation.\n\nHowever, while rowing thrives throughout Britain's coastal areas, reaching inner-city youngsters is a challenge that requires more attention, despite work already being done to attract less affluent people to the sport.\n\n\"Cities are a major challenge for rowing, as in a number of other sports,\" Dickie says. \"If you look at the Lea Rowing Club in Hackney, it is one of the biggest clubs in the UK for participation. Some of that is down to their adult programme but a lot of it is down to London Youth Rowing's involvement. We hope more projects like this can prosper.\"\n\nSailing by Steven Morris\n\nThe Olympic sailor Annie Lush believes there has been a sea change in the way her sport is seen following the successful 2012 regatta in Weymouth and Portland.\n\n\"It used to be that people looked confused when you said you were a sailor. They didn't really know what that meant. Now they do and some even know a bit about the different boats. London 2012 inspired people but also informed them about our sport.\"\n\nLush was speaking after a day on the Queen Mary Reservoir in Surrey where she coached not only keen amateur sailors but novices. \"Some had never even been on the water before. That's really exciting.\"\n\nIt has been a decent year for elite British sailing in the post-Ben Ainslie era with proven performers and newcomers turning in good performances in European and world championships.\n\nIn the Finn class, which Ainslie, right, dominated, four British sailors \u2013 Giles Scott, Andrew Mills, Ed Wright and Mark Andrews \u2013 have swept all before them, the start of an almighty scrap for the one GB Finn berth in Rio.\n\nThere has been joy for the British windsurfers. Not only has their sport won a reprieve after being dropped from Rio 2016 but Nick Dempsey, the silver medallist at Weymouth, was crowned world champion in Brazil in March.\n\nThey have the financial backing. After Sir Ben and co helped the British sailing team hit their target of five medals last year, UK Sport awarded it \u00a324.5m for the Rio cycle \u2013 a slight increase on the \u00a322.9m the team had ahead of Weymouth. But is Lush right in thinking that grassroots sailing has received a boost since Weymouth?\n\nAccording to Sport England's figures, on average 61,400 adults took part in at least half an hour of sailing a week between April 2012 and April this year. That was an increase on the 56,000 for the previous 12 months.\n\nOn the face of it, club membership was a little disappointing. The Sport England figures concluded that 44,100 people were active members of a sailing club in the 12 months up to April this year, a decrease from almost 50,000 in October 2011 to October 2012.\n\nSport England has reduced the amount of money it is investing in sailing \u2013 \u00a39.3m for the next four years (compared with \u00a39.6m for the previous four), of which \u00a35.8m is being spent on the grassroots side.\n\nThe governing body, the Royal Yachting Association, spends that grassroots money on three main schemes. Its Onboard programme aims to get young people into sailing and windsurfing. Some 60,000 youngsters took part in that last year, with 8,500 continuing to sail regularly according to the RYA. The Active Marina scheme is designed to get more adult skippers and crew out and about more often, while its Sailability project builds on the success of GB's Paralympic sailors by attracting more people with disabilities to the sport.\n\nJon White, the RYA sport development manager, says the clubs doing best are those being imaginative, offering extras such as volleyball or mountain biking to make sure there is something for all the family. White is also pleased that more people, especially youngsters, are sailing in inner cities such as Manchester and Birmingham. More than 100 sailors from 25 boroughs competed in the London Youth Games regatta in June. \"We're positive about the interest London 2012 created but we can't rest on our laurels.\"\n\nSwimming by Owen Gibson\n\nDavid Sparkes, the chief executive of British Swimming for almost two decades, describes the sport's failure at London 2012 as \"almost like a bereavement\". While the rest of Team GB went medal mad, the demoralised and frayed swimmers had only Michael Jamieson's silver and two battling bronze medals for Rebecca Adlington to show for seven years of promises.\n\nSuccess elsewhere merely exacerbated swimming's shortcomings. While there were plenty of finalists, too few managed to convert and too many of those feted before the Games delivered curiously lacklustre performances.\n\nA post-Games review found that coaches and athletes were not handled well in the crucial period between the trials. An \"insulted, disheartened and saddened\" Adlington was openly critical of the review process.\n\n\"That critical phase was the one when we weren't there,\" says Sparkes, currently in Barcelona for the world championships. \"What was missing was some leadership. That was what caused us to reflect on what sort of leadership we needed for the future and how we could make some changes.\"\n\nSo in came Bill Furniss, long time coach of Adlington, and Chris Spice, a performance director at the Rugby Football Union, Great Britain Hockey and British Basketball, as head coach and performance director respectively.\n\n\"They are working hard to address the issues that we identified post-London,\" Sparkes says. \"They have set about it with a much tougher, more challenging regime. We had some great coaches and some great athletes. It was a leadership problem.\"\n\nThe board has promised to be more proactive in monitoring the performance of the swimmers and coaches. But underachievement in London has also led to a \u00a34m funding reduction from UK Sport, which has effectively placed the sport in special measures. It must return to the UK Sport board at the end of the year to show its changes are working. Sparkes says the changes introduced by Furniss and Spice should start to bear fruit at the European Championships in Berlin next year and the Glasgow Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"I always think it's rather perverse, that if you underachieve then they take money away and it's harder to achieve,\" Sparkes says. \"We are already having to cut back on some of the programmes and cut our training centres in Swansea and Stirling, which were delivering. It's perverse.\"\n\nIf the margins are narrow at the elite end, then the same is true in participation terms. Having recovered from the effects of the government's decision to axe Labour's free swimming initiative on value for money grounds (causing a fall in those adults swimming once or more a week from 3.27m in 2005 to 2.89m), the latest Sport England figures showed 100,000 more people swimming now than there were 12 months ago.\n\nSparkes says that swimming pool operators have never been busier, though it is hard to say if that is existing swimmers exercising more frequently or new people coming into the sport. Key to progress will be improving on the shaming statistic that only 50% of children learn to swim at school and mitigating the effects of cash-strapped local authorities being forced to consider closing pools.\n\nFemale participation by Owen Gibson\n\nBy the time Victoria Pendleton reminded the country she had predicted London 2012 would be \"an Olympics for the girls\", the narrative was well set. Team GB's first medallist, road cyclist Lizzie Armitstead, had spoken about the inequalities in her sport after winning silver. Then shortly after delivering the gold with Heather Stanning that would spark an avalanche, the rower Helen Glover said she hoped their victory would create a \"snowball effect\" and inspire a generation of girls into sport.\n\nMost agree that the prominence of successful female athletes at the London Games was something of a watershed but one year on they warn that much is still to be done to turn that prominence at a single event into the catalyst for a lasting cultural change.\n\nWomen's Sport and Fitness Foundation chief executive Sue Tibballs says the most visible change has been in the amount of coverage afforded women's sport, citing football's Euro 2013 as an example. The organisation's research had found that women's sport received just 5% of coverage in non-Olympic years, but Tiballs says there had been a \"significant stride forward\" among broadcasters and broadsheets.\n\nAlmost as significant, she says, was the fact that editors of women's magazines such as Cosmopolitan and Company now felt comfortable covering sport having \"woken up to female athletes as role models\". Politicians including the culture secretary Maria Miller and her shadow Harriet Harman have been falling over themselves to embrace the issue. This week alone, the former berated the BBC for not doing more to censure John Inverdale following his disparaging comments about Marion Bartoli and the latter campaigned for a women's Tour de France.\n\nAnd yet. Participation levels have grown in only four sports since the Games, most spectacularly in women's boxing where Nicola Adams has sparked an uplift of 71%. Currently 40.1% of men play sport at least once a week, compared with 30.5% of women. Whereas 6.85m exercised at least once a week in the year to October 2012, that figure fell to 6.785m in the 12 months to April 2013 (although some seasonal factors were at work).\n\nAt a younger age, men are much more likely than women to play sport and Tibballs said more needed to be done to create sporting offers that challenged the preconceptions that teenage girls have around sport.\n\nJane Ashworth, the chief executive of \"doorstep sport\" providers StreetGames, said their successful Us Girls initiative had reached 32,000 16-24 year-olds, many in disadvantaged areas.\n\n\"Their priorities, their friendship groups are very different than the way you do it for lads or those who want to play team sports and ball games,\" she says. \"The boys wanted activities that supported bragging rights \u2013 trophies, medals, leagues. The girls were more sophisticated \u2013 they wanted it to be fun, they wanted it to be sociable and some wanted to bring their mums.\"\n\nWhile some governing bodies, notably netball and cycling, have begun to tailor their offers to appeal to women at different stages of their lives there is still a lot further to go. And while there are some encouraging signs, there is also progress to be made in getting more women on to the boards of governing bodies and realising the commercial appeal of women's sport.\n\n\"In the 1990s the argument was to some extent about winning recognition for women's cricket and football. That argument's largely won. It's now time to turn our attention to everyone else,\" Ashworth says.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345028314339/Fans-watch-the-big-screen-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0bb6f96fada877bc5a4c29051105d173", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CAthletics%2CSport%2CCycling%2CRowing%2CSailing%2CSwimming", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/22/1374515818622/school-sport-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3936b96aa21434c7d982a871a4826f79", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/7/23/1374596833542/Olympic-Stadium-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01c8c390ed16f6651daf097506a76c22", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/7/23/1374596833542/Olympic-Stadium-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdfaf24192439ee5fb273b85098eab2b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/12/1376325314820/School-cross-country-race-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ef448704eaeca79a2ecbdbd555a03e30", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/7/23/1374596833542/Olympic-Stadium-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdfaf24192439ee5fb273b85098eab2b", "date": "23/07/2013"}, "rank_194": {"title": "Christine Ohuruogu goes on the school run to cement Olympic legacy", "text": "Ten stops along the Jubilee Line from Westminster, away from the politicians' glossy-brochure justifications and tumble-dried spin, Christine Ohuruogu is quietly creating an Olympic legacy of her own.\n\nOhuruogu, who was born within a knees-up jog of the Queen Elizabeth stadium in Stratford, has set herself what she calls the \"ridiculous challenge\" of visiting all the schools in her home borough of Newham. How ridiculous becomes clear when she starts trying to add them up \u2013 62 primary schools, she thinks, plus 20 secondary schools and five sixth-form colleges \u2013 as if moving beads on an abacus.\n\n\"It's a long job,\" she admits. \"I'd originally factored in a year but I think it will take me two years to get them all done. I've done about 20, but you know what? However long it takes me, I'll do it.\"\n\nSo what does she do? \"Well,\" she says. \"Some want me to do an assembly or PE lessons, while some just pick my brain and ask questions. I've also done presentations and careers evenings. So it's basically whatever you want: you've got me for an hour, so do as you wish.\"\n\nThe children, understandably, want to paw and grab at her medals: the 400m gold from Beijing followed by a sweet silver in London last year. \"They love seeing them \u2013 Beijing because it's gold and London because it's got the River Thames on it. I let them take them. They can wave them around, they can do whatever they want. The kids aren't going very far, are they? I'll get them back!\"\n\nMany people have paid lip service to Britain's Olympic legacy in the past eight years, ever since London was given the Games on a giddy July morning in 2005, but Ohuruogu feels it is vital that celebrities \u2013 a word she dislikes \u2013 like her muck in and make a difference.\n\n\"If we are talking about changing attitudes and communities, this is where it starts,\" she says. \"These kids probably think there's not very much out there for them. But I was able to compete in a stadium just a mile from where I grew up. I tell them: if I could do that, you guys can be great in whatever you want to do. It doesn't matter where you come from, or how much money your parents have.\"\n\nOhuruogu says she loves the delight in children's eyes when they realise that someone who has run in Stratford's alleys and parks and dead-ends \u2013 yet ended up as Olympic champion \u2013 has come to visit them. \"There are a lot of good kids,\" she says. \"I have visited a lot of schools and some teachers will say: 'Oh, it's a problematic class', but you know what? For the one hour I've got them they are the best kids you can ever ask for. They sit, they listen, they ask questions, they respond, so they can't be that bad.\"\n\nShe felt particularly emotional when she returned to her alma mater, the West Ham Church School. \"I nearly started crying,\" she confesses. \"To actually be a subject of an assembly, when I was once the one sitting on the floor, I thought: 'Oh my gosh'. The head teacher when I was there was actually in the hall, a few teachers that taught me were there too.\"\n\nAs she prepares for this weekend's Anniversary Games, where she will run the 400m, Ohuruogu insists that for her the Olympic legacy burns strong.\n\n\"It's quite sad when you have worked so hard for something and all of a sudden it's over,\" she says. \"I still drive past the Olympic Stadium every now and again and it is nice to see.

The communities within the park could yet be successful. One year later, we at the Newham charity Community Links are relentlessly optimistic about the legacy of the Games. However, our interest is to the people who will occupy, use and work in the new spaces: the \"living legacy\".\n\nWe are pleased at the commitment London Legacy Development Corporation has shown so far to the neighbourhoods and communities that surround the park. However, there is a risk that austerity and budget pressures will force that wider vision to shrink to focus purely on the park infrastructure. Oliver Wainwright's comparison with the Canary Wharf development of the 1980s is instructive: the last thing we wish is for the park to become an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty.\n\nThe Olympics investment has already made a genuine difference for many people. We will do all we can to ensure that the benefit is shared by local communities, people seeking work, enterprising start-up businesses, young people with aspirations for a better life and local families for whom the park will be part of their local landscape.\n\nWe are not sitting back and waiting for legacy to arrive. It is unrealistic to expect it to have happened in a year. And the media have a crucial role to play here. If the story is that legacy hasn't worked and won't work, you are sending the young people of east London a message of hopelessness; only by working together can we make the legacy live.\n\nGeraldine Blake\n\nChief executive, Community Links", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "23/07/2013"}, "rank_196": {"title": "London Olympics legacy hit by 'barmy lack of joined-up thinking'", "text": "As the first anniversary of the London Olympics nears, two influential former members of the organising committee board have raised fears about the legacy of the Games.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of increasingly triumphalist claims from Westminster and City Hall that the Games are delivering on their legacy promises, Sir Keith Mills, the London 2012 deputy chairman, and Jonathan Edwards, the triple jump gold medallist and a Locog board member, have sounded a note of caution.\n\nMills said there was a \"barmy\" lack of joined-up thinking and called for an integrated national sports plan, driven by the prime minister, while Edwards raised concerns about school sport and local authority cuts.\n\nMills is seeking to support grassroots clubs that meet social needs up and down the country through his investment in his Sported foundation. He said: \"You can never do enough. I'm frustrated that we could have and should have done more. But we shouldn't be too hard on ourselves.\n\n\"We have a problem, like most countries in the western world, with obesity. And sport participation across the board is very sticky. It's not growing as much as we want. I do think there is an opportunity for the government to be more joined up. It hasn't happened. I'd like the government to develop a national sports strategy that brings together health, education, sports clubs and local authorities. At the moment, they all pretty much do their own thing and that seems to me to be a real waste.\"\n\n\"For me the big step change would have been a national sports strategy, with organisations coming together to use the assets we've got. When you've got local authorities closing down facilities because of cuts but schools locking their doors despite having the facilities then that's barmy.\n\nMills, who was chief executive of the London 2012 bid team that secured the Games in 2005 partly due to its legacy vision, said it was not too late to create a more joined-up sports strategy, echoing calls from Lord Coe, the former London 2012 chairman, last week for a 10-year legacy vision. But Mills said individual sports had also missed a trick in the wake of the post-Olympic surge in interest.\n\nThe Tottenham Hotspur director and Air Miles founder had attempted to bring Olympic sports together under one banner as the British Sports Marketing Bureau in order to help realise their commercial potential. But of the 70 sports approached around half, including cycling and athletics, were reluctant and the idea is now dead.\n\n\"The concept was that if sports worked together they could be more successful than the sum of their parts. Look at the Premier League. Manchester United is one of the biggest sports brands in the world but they realise that working together with the other teams is more valuable. That was the message I tried to take to the sports after the Games,\" said Mills, who recently launched a corporate fundraising drive for Sported.\n\n\"But because of the parochial nature of sport, with everyone competing with each other, they have all lost. It's not going to happen now. There are about 70 major sports bodies and we got just about half of them. But that's not enough \u2013 it only works if they want it to work.\"\n\nEdwards said that the impact of local authority cuts on sports facilities was a major threat to the delivery of the legacy of the Games. Earlier this year, Guardian research revealed cuts of over 40% to sport and recreation budgets in some parts of the UK.\n\nHe said: \"What really hits legacy out and about is the fact local authorities are so cash-strapped. You're having to pay extra for bin collection and they're being hit with another potential 10% so they're really struggling. \"It's very, very hard for councils. There are all sorts of issues there. You can see that repairing the sports centre roof or putting on coaching sessions isn't very far up their list of priorities.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/7/23/1374604605451/Keith-Mills-006.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=584a30bfa65950ebcad619ca8aa4ab3d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/7/23/1374604605451/Keith-Mills-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=19af7af209761e4b3dee80b5fbc594bc"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2013/7/23/1374604605451/Keith-Mills-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=19af7af209761e4b3dee80b5fbc594bc", "date": "23/07/2013"}, "rank_135": {"title": "West Ham United must pay \u00a370m bank debt before Olympic Stadium move", "text": "West Ham United will have to pay off all of their bank debt before their move to the Olympic Stadium, according to the club's vice-chairman, Karren Brady.\n\nWest Ham have debts of \u00a370m, with half of that bank debt secured on Upton Park and which has to be cleared when the ground is sold ahead of the move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016.\n\nBrady, giving evidence to the House of Lords committee on Olympic and Paralympic legacy on Wednesday, also insisted the club were not getting the stadium on the cheap and the deal was good value to the taxpayer.\n\nThe Premier League club did have a buyer in place for Upton Park but that fell through because of delays to the deal to become Olympic Stadium tenants. Brady also stated that the sluggish property market means she expects income projections from the sale to be down 50% on 2010.\n\nBrady added that she did not expect the sale would cover much more than the lump sum the club will have to pay to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) to move to the Olympic venue.\n\nShe said: \"We did have a tentative deal [for Upton Park] but that fell away. We hope the money generated from the sale of Upton Park will be enough to fulfil our commitment and to help pay off some of our bank debt.\n\n\"When we bought the club and took on more than \u00a3100m of debt, that was guaranteed on the ground. We have to pay off all our bank debt to move, we can't take the debt with us. If there is any excess [from the sale of Upton Park] it will meet some of that debt but I don't expect there will be.\"\n\nBrady was asked to respond to a claim by the former sports minister Richard Caborn that West Ham were getting the \u00a3600m stadium for only \u00a315m, plus \u00a32m-a-year rent, with the taxpayer picking up the tab. Brady defended the deal, however, and said: \"The alternative scenario does not bear thinking about. West Ham is not getting a free stadium. The stadium was built for the Olympics and what are we going to do with it? Across the world, stadiums that are not used die. Without anchor tenants the cost would be huge to the taxpayer.\"\n\nShe added that West Ham would generate \"many hundreds of millions of pounds\" over the 100-year lease.\n\nThe committee also heard from Leyton Orient's chairman, Barry Hearn, who insisted West Ham's move was \"not a done deal\" because of his continuing judicial review and legal action against the Premier League.\n\nHearn wants his club to be able to groundshare with West Ham and use only the lower tier for Orient's matches. He also described the LLDC's deal with West Ham as \"state sponsorship beyond my wildest dreams\".\n\nHearn said: \"This is not a done deal. West Ham have an agreement but I have a judicial review outstanding and litigation with the Premier League that [means] West Ham even moving would be a breach of Premier League rules.\n\n\"We have ended up in situation where we have gifted \u00a3500m of taxpayers' money to a Premier League club that has a turnover of more than \u00a3100m. It's a wonderful gift but if I was an Arsenal fan I would wonder why we bothered paying to build a new stadium.\n\n\"This is state sponsorship beyond my wildest dreams.

ClaireJ has been inspired to volunteer as a photographer for a sports club, for example, Gordon Joly is looking forward to exploring the parks and waterways that are reopening around the Olympic Park this weekend and Steveh15 blames his chronic knee pain on Mo Farah.\n\nIf you were a spectator, volunteer or competitor at the Olympic or Paralympic Games, what have been the lasting outcomes of your experience? Have you kept in touch with people you met at the Olympic Park, for instance?\n\nIf you live near one of the Olympic venues, have you seen improvements to the local area as a result of the Games?\n\nOr if you were watching the Games from afar, were you inspired to get fit or to take up a new sport?\n\nWhatever you consider London 2012 has done for you \u2013 let us know by sharing your stories in a comment on this article, or you can share photos using GuardianWitness. Here is a selection of your most inspiring stories.\n\n\"I knew I had to do something more interesting with my life.\"\n\nThomas Walmsley performed in the Olympic opening ceremony \u2013 and says the experience changed his life.\n\n\"We were in the group of men who came out of the hill and pulled up the grass and made it into the industrial revolution wasteland.\n\n\"There was such fantastic camaraderie \u2013 and everyone came from such a wide range of backgrounds. It totally opened my eyes \u2013 how much life has to offer. Not just sport, but life in general. Meeting so many people from across Britain and the world and from so many different backgrounds was the biggest thing. It became a life experience \u2013 you felt a real connection with people.\n\n\"Standing in that Stadium, you got a sense of what we as a species could achieve. A few months prior, none of us knew each other, or what we were going to do. Then you finish, look up and 80,000 people are cheering and you think about all the people watching at home and realise how much you've done.\n\n\"Danny Boyle came to us towards the end and said, 'You'll find that, after all this, there's a gap in your life. You'll need to find something to fill that gap or it will be difficult.' And it was difficult. After the Paralympics had finished, I thought \u2013 what do I do? I felt a bit lost.\n\n\"I wanted to do something physical, something imaginative. Within 6 months I had quit my job and retrained as a personal trainer. Then, just before I qualified, my partner was offered a job in Sweden. In my old job, I was very much tied to the UK. With my career change, it also meant moving countries was now a realistic option too. It's now July 2013 and we have been living Sweden for 3 months and it is a truly wonderful experience.\n\n\"My horizons have broadened so wide, since the ceremony, that the world feels like the most exciting place. The opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games was the catalyst for all of this, and more. I want to thank everyone involved, from the two governments who oversaw it, to the the least involved volunteer. It was worth every penny.\"\n\n\"If it hadn't been for the Games, I wouldn't have volunteered.\"\n\nGay Pride London 2013 Gamesmakers and London Ambassadors formed a large contingent of volunteers - all inspired by The Games.\n\nWhen Sean Jordan saw the adverts asking for volunteers at London 2012, he jumped at the opportunity: \"I'd never been a volunteer before but it was a no-brainer \u2013 I thought, you'll never get that chance again!\"\n\nHe worked as a team leader, in charge of a group of volunteers who worked with the armed forces on security at the main gates of the Olympic Stadium.\n\n\"It blew away all the stereotypes about volunteering \u2013 you know, elderly people all sitting around moaning! It was extremely well-run and very inclusive and we were so well looked after. They said thank you the right amount of times \u2013 and sincerely \u2013 and that impressed me a lot.\"\n\nNow that the London Olympics are over, Gamesmakers are often invited to help out at other events. Earlier this year, Sean received an email asking if he'd like to volunteer at London's Gay Pride.\n\n\"It was such an all-round brilliant experience for a first-time volunteer at the Games that it made me feel comfortable volunteering at Pride. If it hadn't been for the Games, I wouldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"Watching people on the BMX track inspired me.\"\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shanaze Reade of Great Britain trains on the BMX track in the Olympic Park during the London 2012 Olympic Games. Photograph: Phil Walter/Getty Images\n\n13-year-old Jamie-Lee Bamford had never tried BMXing before seeing the sport in the Olympics last year. \"Watching people on the BMX track inspired me. I thought, I want to do that \u2013 but the local council had closed the local dirt track down, so there was nowhere to do it.\"\n\nShe contacted the parish council and managed to negotiate the use of a field for a new BMX track. Together with her friend Ollie, she researched options and found a company that could build a track to fit the site they had been offered. They obtained seed funding from the council and their local village hall and raised more funds by running a \"guess the number of sweets in the jar\" at a local fete. A former parish councillor secured a grant for the rest of the money they needed.\n\nJamie-Lee's persistence in getting the track built has been recognised by Community Games, a charity set up to help build a lasting cultural and sporting legacy from London 2012, who have her crowned a 'Shining Light'.\n\nA year after Jamie-Lee's first letter to the council, the BMX track is now open to the public. She says the new track is popular with children from the age of four upwards - as well as adults. It's great to see the track being used, she says, because \"now people can do cool tricks\". But Jamie-Lee will need a bit more practice before she competes in the Olympics herself: \"I can clear a few jumps \u2013 that's about it.\"\n\n\"I wasn't expecting to make new lifelong friendships.\"\n\nChris Watt (second from right) met new friend Will Orrock (second from left) while performing in the opening ceremony at the Olympics. Photograph: Chris Watt/GuardianWitness\n\nChris Watt performed as one of nine John Lennons in the Olympic opening ceremony. \"We'd got an email saying, 'Are you a good rollerskater? Can you play drums? Or are you just generally enthusiastic?' I had none of those specific skills, so I ticked that last box.\n\n\"When we first turned up, we didn't know what we were doing there. Even after the first rehearsal, we still didn't know what our part was. I met Will for the first time properly on the day we found out we were going to be the Beatles. Will and I are both big Beatles fans so we were loving it!\n\n\"By the time we started going to the stadium for rehearsals, we were pretty much best mates. We've both worked in the same industry \u2013 we're both into creative things and making new things. Now his girlfriend is friends with my girlfriend.\n\n\"The actual night was just bonkers. You knew it was going to be epic but it wasn't until you got the full crowd in... it's giving me goosebumps just thinking about it! When the rings came together \u2013 that was the moment! We turned to salute the crowd and the crowd went absolutely berserk.\n\n\"When I look back on it now, there are so many little stories that can inspire you, like coming out of the stadium late at night and the Gamesmakers were there \u2013 and they had stood outside all day and seen none of the action, and late at night they were still there, helping you find the way out. It was just a really infectious positive attitude.\"\n\n\u201cSome people find it hard to let go.\u201d\n\nWhen Philip Slade joined the rehearsals for the opening ceremony, he found that groups of friends and couples who had volunteered together were quickly split up as they were allocated to different sections. \"That meant there were 6000 people there who were all individuals \u2013 the most bizarre piece of social engineering. I ended up with the most bizarre, diverse group of friends, people from all over the world, and with extremes of income. It's unheard of in an urban environment to make 10 close new friends, but you spend five months with someone and you bond! Now I see my Olympic chums on a weekly basis.\n\n\"After the Games, some people formed into a unit called the Pandemonium Drummers. It started with the Olympic drummers, then the industrial revolution performers and it just snowballed. They've performed at lots of big, mainstream events. I did the Champions League ceremony; I led the Bayern Munich team out on to the pitch at Wembley, carrying their flag. I did a few events, then I thought, I've really got to let go!\"\n\nWhen he was offered the chance to perform at Notting Hill Carnival this year, he says, his wife gave him a disapproving look. \"In her words: 'Walk away!'\"\n\nLeaving London 2012 behind can be hard, Philip says. \"It really creeps up on you \u2013 you miss it emotionally. It's a real hole. Some people find it hard to let go. I'm not criticising any of my new-found friends, but the reunions have possibly gone on a bit too long.\n\n\"I think the true legacy of taking part in the Olympics, whether as an athlete or a performer or a volunteer, was that everyone got that push, that sense of confidence and self-belief.

In the weeks that followed, a surge of enthusiasm made it seem almost possible that Britons would rise as one from the couch and clog the roads running and cycling. The ambition of the winning bid in 2005, that the Olympics would \"enhance sport in the UK forever\", would be triumphantly fulfilled.\n\nIt was never going to be that easy. European figures for participation put Britain mid-table, below all the other north European countries except Denmark. And although Sport England reported a 1.4 million jump in participation in the seven years between winning the bid and hosting the games in 2012, other research suggested that a similar increase was happening across the EU.\n\nNow Sport England is reporting numbers falling by 200,000. It blames the cold spring. But it seems more like a warning that, despite the continuing inspirational successes of our elite athletes, the participation element of the Olympic legacy isn't going quite according to plan.\n\nAdd to that the decision by Lord Seb Coe, whose talismanic presence seemed a guarantee of governmental seriousness, to quit his role as legacy ambassador in the Cabinet Office, together with a warning from Sir Keith Mills, deputy chairman of London 2012, of a \"barmy\" lack of joined-up thinking, and muttering from Jonathan Edwards, the triple-jump gold medallist, about the impact of cuts in local council spending on sports facilities \u2013 and it seems the brave promises of the bid, of five hours of high-quality sport a week for 15 to 16-year-olds and three hours a week for 16 to 19-year-olds were merely good intentions.\n\nCoe was right to point out that building participation is a long-term project. Joined-up thinking, linking health and education with sport at national and local level, is so much easier to write than to do (the new public health obligation on local authorities may just help here). Schools and sports clubs are vital. But countries with higher levels of participation also pump in locally administered public funding. Britain, uniquely, has low levels of public funding, high charges and low levels of membership.\n\nThat may be why last week's report from MPs on the education committee found some sports clubs were trying to support sport in four or five different schools. But the most striking problem they identified is the shortage of facilities: compulsory swimming is no use if there is no access to a pool. Some inner-city boroughs are down to their last one.\n\nNo wonder half of all under 11s wouldn't be able to swim a length in the 2012 aquatics centre. Running tracks close, no one checks that primary schools use their special sports budget on sports \u2013 and the legacy struggles.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/26/1374834110004/Olympics-one-year-on-athl-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9375c50ba064145f8120afe86a9326a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374850617623/Olympics-Day-15---Athleti-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2832772b8c147c7e4a4f38bbd094939e", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CSebastian+Coe%2CSport%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "25/07/2013"}, "rank_178": {"title": "Boris Johnson trumpets Olympic legacy as Usain Bolt returns to London", "text": "Usain Bolt is in town, tailed by a media scrum, Boris Johnson is attempting to steal the headlines with eye-catching pronouncements, and the government is pumping out endless statistics about the value of the Olympic legacy. A year on from London 2012, it's like the last 12 months never happened.\n\nBut as the London mayor revealed that Westfield \u2013 the operator of the huge shopping centre that acts as a gateway to the Olympic Park \u2013 was planning to build Europe's largest indoor ski centre, a fierce debate over the Games' legacy continued to rage.\n\nAnd in contrast to the media love-in of 2012, rather than facing playful questions about chicken nuggets Bolt, back in London for Friday's Anniversary Games at the Olympic Stadium, was forced to defend himself in the wake of a spate of failed drug tests among his rivals.\n\nThe Jamaican world record holder was faced not with the usual gentle probing about his form but was instead forced to protest his innocence and admit that the doping revelations about Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell had knocked the image of the sport.\n\n\"I am confident in myself and my team, the people I work with. And I know I am clean. So I'm just going to continue running, using my talent and just trying to improve the sport and help the sport,\" said Bolt, who will appear on Friday and Saturday at the Olympic Stadium when it is filled for the first time since the Games to mark the one-year anniversary.\n\nBolt will run alongside Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill and other heroes of the London Games at the two day event, which will be followed on Sunday by the IPC International Challenge, featuring Paralympians including Jonnie Peacock. The sold out stadium is expected to welcome 180,000 fans over the three days.\n\nJohnson, ramping up the rhetoric to Olympian proportions, reminded a press conference attended by last summer's familiar faces \u2013 including the mayor of Hackney and the Metropolitan police chief \u2013 that permanent uses had been found all eight venues in the Olympic Park.\n\n\"Remember the fate of the Olympo-sceptics is all I would say to anyone tempted to doubt the legacy. If you are tempted to think in that kind of way you will be proved wrong,\" said Johnson.\n\nRower Anna Watkins, who won a gold medal with Kath Grainger, said the Games had provided a huge boost to women's sport. Paralympian Martine Wright, who was injured in the 7 July bombings and went on to play sitting volleyball for Team GB, said they had \"proved sport can inspire a better world\".\n\nAnnouncing Westfield's planning application, which would see in an indoor skiing facility twice the size of the UK's current largest within two years, the mayor also said that the London Legacy Development Corporation was in \"substantive discussions\" with University College London about a major new campus on the site where Team GB won a record haul of medals last summer.\n\nJohnson also hinted that discussions were under way with a major museum or cultural attraction for an offshoot on the Olympic Park, although officials later confirmed that earlier plans for an Olympic museum had been definitively shelved.\n\n\"It is very largely, or at least partially, as a result of the Olympics and Paralympics that we are seeing a surge of confidence and optimism in investment in London. Schemes that have been blocked for decades are now going ahead \u2013 Battersea, Croydon, Royal Albert Dock,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"I have no doubt the Olympic impetus has been very valuable,\" claimed Johnson, a ubiquitous presence during last year's Games \u2013 whether dangling from a zipwire or waving the flag.\n\n\"I'm not going to sit here and claim that everything is better as a result of the Olympics,\" he said, before going on to do just that.

But will the \u00a38.7bn that was spent on them deliver the legacy that was promised \u2013 and in particular, are we any fitter or healthier?\n\nOn Friday night, Usain Bolt, arguably the biggest star in sport, will thunder down the track where he won three gold medals 12 months ago, amid the head-spinning swirl of London's giddy and glorious Games. On Saturday, it will be the turn of Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah to return to the spine-tingling scene of their Super Saturday triumphs as the 60,000 people watching try and recapture some of that Olympic magic.\n\nBut beyond the confines of a stadium that now has a secure future as a home for West Ham and athletics, albeit at a cost of at least \u00a3600m to the taxpayer, the Olympic Park remains in a state of flux. And like the dusty expanses that once played host to a sporting wonderland and will soon become houses and parkland, the wider legacy promises \u2013 layer upon layer of them, like tiers of a wedding cake, to justify the Games' \u00a38.7bn cost \u2013 are a work in progress. The L-word came to mean so many things to so many people that trying to determine its success can be like searching for the end of the rainbow.\n\nAs Farah, Ennis-Hill et al take to the track again, it is a reminder that it is both the physical regeneration of this once-scarred patch of east London, pump-primed with billions of pounds of public money, and the legacy of Britain's elite sporting infrastructure that appear most secure one year on.\n\nEven before the curtain had come down on the Olympics, the government had promised to boost its investment in the next Olympic cycle by 11%, to \u00a3355m, to ensure our transformation from plucky losers to driven winners was sustained.\n\nThe revolution in British sport \u2013 which began when National Lottery funding began to pour into the system \u2013 was honed by brilliant minds to combine with another huge boost in funding in 2005, and delivered an avalanche of medals in 2008 and 2012.\n\nSome of the smaller sports that enjoyed a moment in the sun in London have struggled since \u2013 victims of UK Sport's ruthless \"no compromise\" policy and a lack of commercial interest now that the bandwagon has moved on. But the principle of pouring large amounts of exchequer and lottery money into elite sport has retained broad public support.\n\nLiz Nicholl, the chief executive of UK Sport, which decides how that \u00a3355m should be divvied up, is clear that there is no turning back. She has promised to deliver more medals in more sports in Rio in three years' time.\n\n\"During the Games, it was a unique opportunity for the whole nation to see elite sport, to value it, to be proud of it, to feel it, to experience it and be inspired by it. And our politicians were there, and they saw it and they felt it. They saw the nation was proud, and that a proud nation is a happy nation,\" she says.\n\nElsewhere, legacy remains in the eye of the beholder. Look left as you come out of a spruced-up Stratford tube station and you'll see that towering temple to consumerism, the Westfield shopping centre, which acts as the gateway to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, attracting more than 700,000 visitors a week and employing thousands of locals.\n\nTurn right, however, and walk through the indoor market stalls and discount shops of the Stratford Centre and on into Plaistow, and you'll still find plenty of locals wondering what the Olympics have done for them.\n\nBut there are others who, while reserving judgment on the Park, concede that the Olympics have, at the very least, put their postcode on the map. It suddenly feels like part of London rather than an afterthought, and many of the 11 million people who streamed into the Park last summer have already returned \u2013 whether to shop at Westfield or watch Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe lofty, endlessly stated aim of politicians was to use the Games as the catalyst for social change, to bring east London closer to the west in terms of prosperity, and change the much-quoted statistic that you lose a year in life expectancy for every station you pass eastwards on the Jubilee line between Westminster and Canning Town.\n\nLondon's mayor, Boris Johnson, was on typically ebullient form this week as he delivered a series of set pieces bashing the \"Olympo-sceptics\" and, inevitably for a man drawn to the big idea like a moth to a flame, unveiling a new scheme for Europe's largest indoor ski centre next to the Park.\n\n\"The Olympics have helped trigger a regeneration in east London that has been accelerated by about 70 years,\" he said, pointing not only to Westfield but to the new iCity development that houses BT Sport's new studios and a planned \"tech hub\". \"There's a secondary impact and I really believe it. There is no doubt in my mind that there has been an absolute fascination among international investors around London and east London. The idea that London was open and accessible and a great place to invest has caught on internationally.\"\n\nPaul Deighton, the man who brilliantly marshalled Locog (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games) to deliver the Games and then took up a role as commercial secretary to the Treasury, in order to try to bring some of that stardust to large-scale infrastructure projects like HS2, is similarly enthusiastic. He says that a sceptically received UK Trade & Investment (UKTI) prediction that the Olympics would translate into \u00a340bn in extra inward investment by the end of the decade was in fact a woeful underestimate.\n\nThe Westfield shopping centre near the Olympic site in Stratford, east London, has given the area a boost, but not everyone locally has felt the benefits of the Games. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP\n\nThis is where the legacy again becomes open to interpretation. Westfield would have happened without the Games (albeit more slowly), and while Johnson says the Chinese investment in Royal Albert Dock was a direct result of the Olympics, others say it was nothing to do with it. Newham says 5,000 residents were helped into Games-time jobs, but most of those were temporary.\n\nEither way, there can be little doubt that the Games have helped transform perceptions of a small corner of the East End. More uncertain is what sort of place the Olympic Park and its surrounds will become. Executives of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) insist that it won't become an island of prosperity amid poverty, like Canary Wharf.\n\n\"This isn't going to be a gated community. In terms of the housing we're building, a large component is social housing with a rented element as well. It's always been our aim to create a mixed community on the Park that matches the diversity of the local area,\" insists the LLDC chief executive, Dennis Hone, as he walks around the track in the stadium.\n\nBut Newham's chief executive, Kim Bromley-Derry, is just as quick to point out that it must also raise aspiration and provide employment where its residents can work as well as live. That is the balancing act this surprisingly cluttered and compact urban park must perform.\n\nBut it is the claim that hosting the biggest sporting event in the world would inspire a nation to become fitter and healthier that remains most open to challenge. Here again, it can be hard to separate the rhetoric from the reality.\n\nWander around Charlton Park and the adjoining Hornfair Park on a summer's evening and you'll see young people splashing around in the newly refurbished 50-metre lido, brand new tennis courts full to bursting, teenagers tearing around a new BMX track, the \"Adizone\" outdoor gym in regular use, and a queue for the outdoor table tennis table. All are directly or indirectly linked to \"legacy\" projects.\n\nIn Greenwich, one of the five Olympic boroughs, it feels as close as we may ever get in grimy south-east London to the continental idyll of community sports facilities in every town or suburb, offering cheap, easy access to exercise to all who want it.\n\nYet, up and down the country, other local authorities are being forced to slash their sport and recreation budgets by up to 40%, putting facilities, coaching programmes and maintenance budgets under grave threat. Some, such as the closure of the Don Valley stadium in Sheffield, where Ennis-Hill trains, and of Newcastle's City pool, have been high profile. Others, such as a battle to maintain football pitches on Hackney Marshes in east London, less so.\n\nWhile grassroots sport quango Sport England has seen its annual investment of \u00a3300m go up as a result of coalition changes to the distribution of lottery income \u2013 a large chunk of which is channelled through sports governing bodies and targeted at 16- to 25-year-olds \u2013 it is just one part of a much wider picture.\n\nThe official figures measuring sports participation are disappointing, though the former London 2012 chairman Lord Coe is right to plead for time. The latest numbers show that, of 29 sports that recorded a change in once-a-week participation figures, 20 suffered a decline.\n\nAnd while 15.4 million people played sport at least once a week in April 2012, a year later that figure has declined to 15.3 million. The government prefers instead to focus on the fact that 1.4 million more people are playing sport once a week than they were when the bid was won in 2005.\n\nAn earlier promise to increase the number of people playing sport three times or more a week by one million, and a parallel promise by the NHS to increase the number of people taking exercise by the same number, were quietly dropped before the Olympics when it became clear they wouldn't be met.\n\nFans cheering on Jessica Ennis at the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield last summer. Don Valley is to be closed in September. Photograph: Gary Wolstenholme/Redferns/Getty\n\nA new BBC poll showing that only one in 10 people played more sport as a result of the Games, but that seven in 10 thought it was value for money, shouldn't come as a huge surprise. Beyond the rhetoric, the link remained tenuous at best.\n\nIn some ways, elite athletes are the very worst people to ask whether inspiration can beget participation. They can all trace the spark of their sporting career back to a moment of inspiration, without realising that they are exceptional rather than typical.\n\nBut as far as the younger generation is concerned, those who were cynical about the link between watching feats of remarkable sporting achievement and increased enthusiasm for playing it were forced to eat their words last summer \u2013 up to a point.\n\nAnyone who witnessed the surge of enthusiasm in schools across the country, and at the Olympic Park in particular, would have had to work hard to hang on to their cynicism.\n\nBut evidence in the wake of the Games showed a disappointing number ended up on waiting lists at the local athletics club or searching in vain for a gymnastics club that wasn't oversubscribed. Meanwhile, school sport remains in flux.\n\n\"For me, the biggest disappointment is still school sport. I think we have gone backwards. I can't say anything else and be honest,\" says Olympic gold medallist and Locog board member Jonathan Edwards. \"The primary school money is there, but there is no network and, anecdotally, some of the stories about how that money is being spent aren't brilliant. They might have had their faults, but school sports partnerships were essentially doing a good job. To dismantle that and start again from scratch \u2013 it's madness.\"\n\nAnd given that the central pledge of the Games was to \"inspire a generation\", it seems bizarre that there is no way of actually measuring how many kids are playing sport. The coalition scrapped Labour's national school sport survey, saying it was overly bureaucratic, while Sport England currently only measures adults and relies on landline telephone surveys.\n\nAn education select committee report published last week welcomed the \u00a3150m investment in primary schools announced in March, which replaces the \u00a3162m school sport partnerships that were axed in December 2010, but said it was far from enough on its own.\n\nIt said that without extending the two-year commitment to invest \u00a3150m annually in primary school sport it risked being seen as little more than a \"gimmick\", and said schools needed more support in how it was spent.\n\nA commitment to training more specialist PE teachers and to raising awareness among primary-age teachers of the importance of sport are to be welcomed, but there remains a lack of joined-up thinking.\n\nAnd too much time is still spent on the redundant exercise of championing competitive sport over some non-existent \"prizes for all culture\" when the emphasis should be on getting kids to exercise, whether that means hula-hoops or hockey sticks.\n\nSpeak to those involved in the original bid, from Tony Blair down, and they will claim that a key plank of their mission was to shift the centre of gravity so that sport would come to be seen as an integral part of education, health and social policy. With the NHS and education policy in a state of permanent revolution, it is little surprise that embedding sport and exercise are not at the top of their priority list.\n\nCoe is right to point out that the fact that these questions are on the agenda at all is a victory of sorts. Others, such as former Locog deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills, who has taken matters into his own hands with his Sported foundation, believe there is an awfully long way to go.\n\nDuring the seven-year run-up to the Games, it was as though the government was so taken with Coe's legacy pitch that it couldn't resist endlessly adding promise after promise to the list.\n\nThe legacy for volunteering, for one, is harder to fathom. The whole nation was caught up in a wave of enthusiasm for the 70,000 purple and red-clad Games Makers a year ago, but here, too, there is a feeling that the momentum stalled as those treasured uniforms were returned to the wardrobe as keepsakes.\n\nThere are other shifts in perception that shouldn't be underestimated. According to Sue Tibballs, chief executive of the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation and a longstanding critic of the lack of media coverage for female athletes, the Games were a watershed moment in the way female sports stars are perceived.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium being prepared for the first anniversary of the Games at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA\n\nIn some sports there is a clear correlation between the investment that was guaranteed and maintained as a result of a home Games and their success in driving achievement at all levels.\n\nBritish cycling has become the exemplar of how to marry elite success with long-term growth at the grassroots, creating a virtuous circle of public and corporate investment to deliver ever more ambitious goals.\n\nNicola Adams, the first British female boxer to win a gold medal, has almost single-handedly inspired a 79% uplift in the number of women practising her sport regularly. \"A lot of girls come up to me all the time and say I've inspired them to take up boxing. It's really good to see,\" she says.\n\nYet other sports, like netball, suggest it is not major events that boost participation but well thought-out, intelligent marketing and strategies. It has targeted lapsed players and mums with clever campaigns and offerings, and been rewarded with a rise in numbers despite not being an Olympic sport. But these are the exceptions that, in too many cases, prove the rule. While there are pockets of good practice among some governing bodies and some schools, there is no overriding sense that sport is becoming more central to our way of life.\n\nWith various degrees of frustration, everyone from outgoing legacy tsar Coe to Locog deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills voices concern that the system is still far from joined-up enough.\n\nMost obviously, the education secretary, Michael Gove, had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table to put up a share of the cash for a new school sport policy to replace the one arbitrarily axed for ideological reasons in 2010. According to a survey commissioned by Asda this week, seven in 10 parents think more sport should be made available to children at primary school. \"It's vital. It's the biggest thing. We talk about finding champions of the future but, to be honest, they're probably always going to find themselves,\" says runner Paula Radcliffe, gazing at the finishing line as thousands stream across it having completed a National Lottery fun run around the Olympic Park. \"I don't think people realise that kids perform better at school, they're happier, and the economy is stronger if everyone does sport. It's making sure there is time allocated in schools, and that they have strong links with clubs. For me, as a parent, if you're told this is the first generation that is going to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents, then that is scary.\"\n\nThis is the somewhat humdrum reality of turning all that glittered last summer into lasting gold. While everyone lauds the cross-party consensus that delivered the Games, the legacy debate has descended into political point-scoring. The shadow culture secretary, Harriet Harman, went on the attack on Friday, accusing the government of \"squandering the Olympic legacy\" and wasting a \"once in a lifetime opportunity\".\n\nYet, even if all that the London Games did was give the country a shot in the arm and provide a stage for a magical six weeks of sporting action, many would argue it was still worth it. Jordan Duckitt, one of the seven teenagers who lit the flame at the climax of Danny Boyle's remarkable opening ceremony, says legacy \"isn't a thing but a feeling\".\n\nChristine Ohuruogu, the London silver medallist who grew up a stone's throw from the Olympic Park, says the Games delivered an unquantifiable dividend that can't just be measured in pounds and pence. Which is why, despite continuing economic uncertainty and widespread social unrest, Tokyo, Istanbul and Madrid are desperately vying to host the 2020 Games.\n\n\"Some things can't be measured. General wellbeing, feeling better \u2013 you can't disregard that impact. Once you aim higher, you have more opportunity. You won't always measure it in monetary value, but I think in emotional, spiritual terms, people feel a lot better about themselves,\" says Ohuruogu.\n\nA YouGov poll published on Friday revealed that 75% of Britons believed London was right to have bid to host the Games, up from the 44% who were in favour of the Games in a poll conducted a year before the Olympics.\n\nWhether that is enough for the electorate \u2013 who this weekend will bathe in the warm glow of memories of a sporting summer like no other \u2013 remains the \u00a38.7bn question.\n\n\"This, for me, is not about a six-week dip in an active people survey. There are serious problems. The average kid in the UK is now 50% less active at the age of 15 than at the age of nine. That is unsustainable,\" says Coe. But without a serious, long-term, cross-party plan to equal that which delivered perhaps the best Olympic Games of modern times, one of its defining legacies could yet be a fatter, rather than a fitter, nation.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374850940291/Fans-cheering-on-Jessica--010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b9a507362734d2c6ad50ae75039000fc", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CPolitics%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374850617623/Olympics-Day-15---Athleti-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4b501a2ad0a7af3a288a7d99d5a7f7b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/7/26/1374834110004/Olympics-one-year-on-athl-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9375c50ba064145f8120afe86a9326a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374851965961/The-Westfield-shopping-ce-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ab63eeb2f3bd19b02af2a7489ae0e2b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/25/1374763284790/5a96e602-c8cf-4fc8-8694-a72f23dadafc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9a3c5277ea7ca5caace5e2d21aea7dc2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374850617623/Olympics-Day-15---Athleti-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2832772b8c147c7e4a4f38bbd094939e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374851389768/London-IAAF-Diamond-Leagu-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=464f8b23c44572afd031c92f5045eceb", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/26/1374850617623/Olympics-Day-15---Athleti-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c4b501a2ad0a7af3a288a7d99d5a7f7b", "date": "26/07/2013"}, "rank_176": {"title": "The Olympic legacy is that it proved public funding works | Andrew Simms", "text": "Welcome to the Britain that actually learned from the best of the Olympics. You take a day off work to potter around your community allotment, paid for by a national public health fund. Next week you fancy another day off to take an interesting elderly person who attends the same GP surgery as you for tea. They talk in fascinating detail about how grim things were before the NHS. After that, maybe a day building a garden at the local school, or helping to set up a publicly funded community green energy scheme. At the end of the month you'll have a big party with everyone else doing similar things, then start all over again. Better still, your employer cheers you on, the national press treats you like a hero and the prime minister lauds the example you have set.\n\nYou're a Games Maker who never gave up. You're living in a nation that stumbled on an extraordinary idea \u2013 that instead of chaining ourselves to desks, working ever longer and throwing ourselves on the mercy of the markets, there is another way. A new book, London 2012: How Was It For Us? argues it could be like this for everyone \u2013 a publicly funded good time: working less, getting to know complete strangers, feeling better about life and watching the economic and social benefits flow.\n\nDavid Cameron and George Osborne would be horrified if the idea crept out because it directly contradicts government moralising on austerity and the primacy of the private sector. Yet it's a lesson we can all draw from, and holds the simple logic of acknowledging the positive impact of the Olympics that the coalition is claiming credit for.\n\nNearly \u00a310bn in trade and investment came our way as a result of hosting the Olympics, they say. Given that the Olympics was over 90% publicly funded, it must be a clear triumph of the stimulus that public spending can generate.\n\nBut that's inconvenient, because the government insists the opposite. Cuts to public investment, we're told, are necessary and inevitable. Cameron says that \"all available policy levers\" should be used to make it easier for the private sector to \"create a new economic dynamism\".\n\nMeanwhile, Osborne positions the public sector as an enemy that \"crowds out\" private enterprise. Sebastian Coe even declared himself, in the Guardian, unsure as to whether he believed in the role of government at all \u2013 at least until the interviewer pointed out that without the government, London 2012 would never have happened.\n\nSuch strangely schizophrenic attitudes could result from common misapprehensions about the financing of the event. Corporate sponsorship grew like ivy over it and special privileges were showered like confetti on to sponsors, so that their role seemed central. But in fact all the heavy lifting was public, in terms of direct funding and volunteer staffing. Only about 6% of funds actually came from corporations.\n\nThere were many things wrong about the event in general. For one thing, it was in the wrong place: other parts of the country needed it far more. And pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline wins a medal for sheer brazenness. Just two weeks after being found guilty of promoting antidepressants for unapproved uses, including treatment of children, they promoted their supplying of anti-doping kits to the Olympics with the slogan, \"the crowd is my only drug\". Survivors of the Bhopal chemical disaster protested at sponsorship from Dow Chemical, and there was the full-blown irony of fossil fuel giant BP being s sustainability partner for the event.\n\nBut nothing should disguise some vital revelations about ourselves and what a dynamic public sphere, widely defined, can achieve. About how our economic options are much broader than we are led to believe.\n\nWhat did the Games show that is truly great about Britain? Danny Boyle's opening ceremony celebrated campaigns for social justice, the collective provision of society's basic needs, literature, music, comedy and the open domain of the worldwide web. These were triumphs largely of the public sphere and collective endeavour, not of the self-interested market. They demonstrate what a truly big society can do when liberated from a narrow economic doctrine.\n\nBeyond basic needs being met, at the heart of our quality of life are the so-called \"five ways to well-being\": connecting with people around us, being active, taking notice of the world, continual learning and giving. One explanation for the national high was that the Olympics created ample opportunities for all of these. It also interrupted our routines, reminding us that we are gregarious beings who like to party, something that some other cultures can be better at remembering.\n\nPhilosopher Mark Rowlands, author of Running with the Pack, asks whether, if there was a pill that provided for all our needs, we would just take it and sit in a chair, satisfied. He thinks not, and views humanity as a maker and player of games for the sake of it.\n\nEconomics today is preached much like Christianity once was. We're meant to endure and forego in the present for some infinitely deferred later promise. It's an analogy for a mistake that Rowlands sees in attitudes to human development: \"We think of childhood as a time of preparation for the important part of life that comes later,\" he writes. \"I suspect this gets things the wrong way around \u2026 Children know that what's worth doing in life is worth doing for its own sake. And everything else is merely unfortunate.\"\n\nAs the politicians polish their reputations with people's memories of London 2012, others might remember clouds of dogma parting briefly to reveal the possibility of a very different, more fortunate Britain.

Basically, it shut half the place down.\n\nThat's the big, forbidding backdrop against which any catalysing force - cultural, social or economic - released by last year's athletic feats in the Olympic Park needs to be assessed. Realising Ken Livingstone's vision of an East End transformation will take decades and the process will underline bedrock truths about regeneration schemes: the public purse is shrinking; difficult deals must be struck and choices made when seeking private sector investment; for some local people change will be good, for others it will not.\n\nWe're not just talking about the park and its immediate surroundings - the area now under mayoral control through the London Legacy Development Corporation - but a huge stretch of territory encompassing the six \"Olympic boroughs\" - Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Waltham Forest, Greenwich and Barking and Dagenham - and stretching further east, taking in Bexley and Havering and the Thames estuary counties beyond.\n\nBoris Johnson has added a large extra dimension to the mayoral ambition he inherited from Livingstone with his persistent lobbying for a new international airport to be built in the Thames estuary or else a big expansion of Stansted. Such an aviation hub would, he contends, quite literally open up the Gateway for new waves of enterprise to flow through the east of the capital.\n\nThe Mayor has been loudly banging the Games anniversary drum, claiming that 20,000 jobs will be created thanks to a Chinese developer's plan to build a business park alongside City Airport in the Royal Docks enterprise zone. Meanwhile, at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park - to give it its royal mouthful of a full name - he heralds a viable multi-use future for the main stadium while iCity proclaims big plans for the now former press and broadcast centre buildings.\n\nFor all the feelgood vibes arguments continue about how far, if at all, the Olympics project has helped the area it was based in and if the money spent on it has been justified. Sober analysts are reserving judgment. But whatever anyone concludes about all that, what matters most is what happens next. What sort of place can and should the new east London become? How can it be ensured that change benefits the local people most in need of it?\n\nAnswers to these questions have already been proposed in the form of, for example, the \"mixed community\" planned for the erstwhile Olympic village (now East Village), the intake of its adjoining school and Newham's now failed attempt to have the Carpenters estate redeveloped as a university campus. Some look more appealing than others.\n\nEarlier this year Bethnal Green and Bow MP Rushanara Ali described growing up in an East End that had been promised great things by the area's last massive regeneration project, Canary Wharf, before observing with regret that very few local people actually have jobs there. \"We must not,\" she concluded, \"make the same mistakes in the next 10 or 15 years as we've made in the past.\" Are Boris Johnson and east London's politicians up to that long-distance task?", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Society%2CBoris+Johnson%2CPolitics%2CLondon+politics%2CLondon%2CRegeneration%2CHousing%2CCommunities", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/24/1374651889471/Olympic-stadium-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=859b19131ac1dc601aadbb4c9c7799e2"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "29/07/2013"}, "rank_150": {"title": "Olympic legacy murals met with outrage by London street artists", "text": "'Gentrified graffiti' appears in Hackney Wick \u2013 to the fury of local street artists whose work was removed from the same walls before the 2012 Games\n\nGlaring out from the brick wall of an old sweet factory on the edge of the Olympic site in east London, a furious face throws a toothy snarl across the canal. Half monkey, half skull, with a golden clothes peg for a nose, the creature has every reason to be angry.\n\nIt is the work of local street art collective, the Burning Candy Crew, whose psychedelic scenes defined this industrial stretch of the River Lea Navigation, until they were mostly painted over in preparation for the 2012 Games. Now, on those very walls, the Olympic legacy's public art body has unveiled a series of new artworks \u2013 with not a local artist in sight.\n\n\u201cIt was a very deliberate decision,\u201d says Sarah Weir, former head of arts and cultural strategy for the Olympics, who now heads up the Legacy List charity that commissioned the work. \u201cWe unashamedly wanted to showcase the best international artists and transform this part of the canal into a destination for street art. We want it to have the same energy as somewhere like Camden \u2013 I hope people will come on boat tours to see the work.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Off the wall \u2026 the mural by Mark Lyken and Teo Moneyless is on the wall in front of an old sweet factory, where local artists used to paint\n\nThe four new works, which occupy prominent stretches of wall along both sides of the water, are by artists invited from Brazil and Sweden, Italy, Scotland and the Netherlands. On one building, a graphic black-and-white mural by Swedish artist Ekta Ekta climbs up to the eaves, a tangled pile of odds and ends that form a teetering Heath Robinson contraption. Beneath a bridge, a blue form by Brazilian painter Zez\u00e3o unfurls like a tribal marking, recalling the looping shapes of cursive sanskrit script.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to make a museum-quality exhibition in a public space,\u201d says the project's curator, Cedar Lewisohn, who also organised Tate Modern's 2008 Street Art show, which saw the brick facade of Bankside power station covered with murals. \u201cBut curating in such a dynamic context as Hackney Wick is never going to be easy.\u201d\n\nHome to hundreds of artist studios and galleries, the area already has a thriving street art scene. And for local artists, who saw their own work removed from these walls by Hackney and Tower Hamlets councils in the run-up to the Olympics, the project \u2013 which is funded by Bloomberg and supported by the Canal & River Trust \u2013 could not be more offensive.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Washed away \u2026 Dirty Laundry, by the Burning Candy Crew, used to adorn a stretch of wall opposite the Olympic site in Hackney Wick.

Now they have commissioned these murals and covered them in coats of anti-graffiti paint, so we all have to look at them for the next 10 years. It completely goes against the spirit of street art.\u201d\n\nFellow graffiti artist, Mau Mau, agrees: \u201cIt's disrespecting local people's creativity,\u201d he says. \u201cThey paint it all grey for the Olympics, then when it suits them, they choose who paints where. It takes away the authenticity.\u201d\n\nMau Mau was subject to one of the most high-profile acts of Olympic censorship, when his legal street painting of a zombie Ronald McDonald, clad in the logos of the Olympic sponsors and running with a Coke-branded torch belching clouds of black smoke, was hastily painted over by Ealing council. Shortly afterwards, several other artists were pre-emptively arrested and banned from going near Olympic venues for the duration of the Games.\n\nCommercialised \u2026 one of the new murals commissioned by the Legacy List, by Dutch collective Graphic Surgery. Photograph: the Canals Project\n\n\u201cIt continuously happens with rebellious ideas in art or music,\u201d says Mau Mau. \u201cThe authorities know they can't stop it, so they have to control it.

The pledge sparked a furious debate about the extent to which a major sporting event could inspire a lasting uptake in grass-roots participation, particularly against the backdrop of local authority funding cuts.\n\nDebbie Jevans, the London 2012 director of sport who is now chief executive of the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England, conceded more could have been done before the Games to work with sports to ensure a grass-roots legacy was delivered.\n\n\"If you look at the legacy from 2012, you can go to the Olympic Park and it's clear. You've got the stadium, you've got the multi-sport arena at the Copper Box, you've got the legacy for cycling,\" she said at a Sports Industry breakfast. \"But if I look back, the one lesson I've learned is that it's absolutely pointless talking about legacy when the event is over. If you do that, you've missed a trick,\" said Jevans, who recently also joined the board of Sport England, the government quango charged with increasing sports participation, particularly among 14- to 25-year-olds.\n\n\"We maybe could have planned that participation [legacy] with all the sports better in the build-up of the seven years we had to the Olympic Games. I took that across to rugby and we're working very closely with the RFU to ensure legacy is part of the delivery plan.\"\n\nWhereas the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games was expressly tasked with delivering the much-praised event, responsibility for increasing participation lies with Sport England.\n\nFigures released earlier this year showed that of 29 sports that recorded a change in once-a-week participation figures, 20 suffered a decline.\n\nAnd while 15.4m people played sport at least once a week in April 2012, a year later that figure had declined to 15.3m. The government prefers instead to focus on the fact that 1.4m more people are playing sport once a week than they were when the bid was won in 2005.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/11/6/1383767284060/It-was-hoped-the-London-2-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1492039419bcdd0fb1da15a59724be2", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/11/6/1383767284060/It-was-hoped-the-London-2-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e2df3c7f2c02073abd6c4158b231410b", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2CLocog%2COlympic+legacy%2CUK+news%2CSport%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2013/11/6/1383767284060/It-was-hoped-the-London-2-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e2df3c7f2c02073abd6c4158b231410b", "date": "06/11/2013"}, "rank_192": {"title": "Work begins on turning Olympic Stadium into West Ham United's new home \u2013 video", "text": "Construction on a new roof for London's Olympic stadium is under way as it begins its transformation into West Ham United's new home.

But will Chobham Academy deliver the promised community benefits?\n\nOn Cheering Lane in east London's new Olympic legacy postcode of E20, an army of 4 year-olds march along the pavement in neat black blazers. They are filing towards the tree-lined square of Ulysses Place, where a red concrete wall waits to greet them, emblazoned with big bronze letters. \u201cTo strive, to seek, to find and not to yield,\u201d it reads, the final line of Tennyson's Ulysses, reconfigured as a motivational motto.\n\nIt could be a scene from the Victorian chapter of Danny Boyle's opening ceremony, but this is a normal morning at Chobham Academy, the new school for 3\u201319 year-olds in the so-called \"legacy\" village. Coming to the end of its first term, it has around 600 pupils. It will soon cater for over 2,000.\n\n\u201cWe wanted the school to be the social heart of the place,\u201d says Simon Allford, of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), the architects responsible for the \u00a333m building, a campus of three blocks that revolve around a big serrated drum. \u201cThe circular form means it doesn't have a front and a back. It should act as the fulcrum between the new community on the Olympic site and the existing communities around the edge.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Community fulcrum? \u2026 The school sits in the corner of the former athletes' village, with the streets of Leyton beyond. Photograph: ODA\n\nSited in the north-east corner of the former athletes' village, the school serves a pivotal role in attempting to stitch these two very different worlds together. To the east, across a deep railway cutting and a jumble of industrial sheds, lie the terraced streets of Leyton and Stratford, home to some of London's most deprived wards, where over a third of children still live in poverty.\n\nImmediately to the west are the sparkling concrete citadels of what is now branded East Village, a Stalinist complex of 10-storey apartment blocks that frame sweeping ceremonial boulevards with names like Prize Walk and Anthem Way. Half sold off to the Qatari royal family and available for high-end private rent \u2013 with the other half managed by a consortium of housing associations for \u201caffordable\u201d rates (80% of the market value) and shared-ownership \u2013 it promises to be a place far removed from the world across the tracks.\n\nAfter months of delays, the first residents will finally move in over the coming weeks, but it will be a long time before the 2,800 flats are filled and the windswept streets have the bustle of a real neighbourhood. If the school is to be the linchpin of whatever community emerges here, and act as a bridge to the surrounding area, it certainly has its work cut out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arts factory \u2026 the saw-tooth profile of the arts specialism block. Photograph: Timothy Soar/AHMM\n\n\u201cIn Victorian London, schools always stood as civic beacons like a church in the town square,\u201d says Allford, as we turn the corner of Liberty Bridge Road, to see his minty green barrel terminating the end of the axis. \u201cThey were always bigger than the neighbouring housing, but here we're competing with these massive blocks of flats. The school could never be taller, so we wanted to make it stand out as something different.\u201d\n\nThe original model was the terracotta drum of the Royal Albert Hall, surrounded by its mansion blocks in South Kensington, but the colour was quickly dropped. \u201cThe Olympic Delivery Authority was worried the pupils would be nicknamed the Tango kids if their school was bright orange,\u201d grins Allford. He says the pale green, which gives the whole complex a slightly medicinal tinge, simply comes from the high iron content of the float glass with which the buildings are clad. The metal mullions are painted to match.\n\nDeveloped since 2004 as part of the Stratford City plan, long before the Olympic bid came along, the school was designed without a headteacher in place, giving the architects something of a blank canvas. Sponsored by the athletes' village developer, Lend Lease, it is now run by the Harris Federation, the educational charity of Carpetright millionaire Lord Harris (those expecting jazzy floors will be disappointed: the school favours grey carpet tiles throughout).\n\n\u201cSchools tend to outlast their champions,\u201d says Allford, whose practice has designed a number of award-winning educational buildings, including the Stirling Prize-shortlisted Westminster Academy, the client of which brought them on to this project. \u201cChobham should be able to outlive political change, as it's not stuck in a historical model.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest No man's land \u2026 playful poles and grassy humps in the playground. Photograph: Timothy Soar/AHMM\n\nWith future-proofing in mind, it is designed in three reconfigurable chunks, linked by a big circulation spine, which can be closed off when needs demand. There is the simple L-shaped infant school, the cylindrical upper school with its facade of tapered air vents giving it the look of a great turbine, and a specialism block for arts and performance, conceived as a factory building with a roof of saw-tooth north-lights. The whole ensemble exudes an engineered, industrious feel. This is a place to get things done, and look smart while you're doing it.\n\nThe building's sharp edges are thankfully softened by a playground that meanders around the eastern edge of the site, planted with pine trees and grassy mounds. Designed by landscape architect Lynn Kinnear, as an extension of her other parkland work around the edge of the Olympic site, it imagines the ancient Waltham Forest creeping back into the park, trees interspersed with snaking timber decks and mole-hill humps. Instead of fences, the different areas are bordered by low hedgerows, sprinkled with blackberries and redcurrants, while the older age groups are separate by a playful no man's land of staggered timber poles.\n\nOlympic themed play equipment is conspicuously absent, but then again the velodrome, aquatics centre and basketball courts are a stone's throw away \u2013 along with the 80,000-seater stadium, where the school hopes to hold its sports day next summer. The egg-and-spoon race can rarely have felt so grand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crumpled Guggenheim \u2026 inside the rotunda. Photograph: Timothy Soar/AHMM\n\nAnd this heroic aura appears to be rubbing off on the students. \u201cComing to school here is like coming to the Olympics every morning,\u201d says Shumena Akhter, a sixth-former from Canning Town. \u201cIt's bold and contemporary and modern \u2013 it feels like a destination.\u201d She is not alone in her excitement: over 1,400 pupils applied for the first 150 places, while over 2,500 people turned up at the open evenings, bringing uncles, cousins and neighbours. There is excited talk of swimming lessons in Zaha Hadid's pool, a West Ham football academy, and basketball sessions with the London Lions. There are also other less wholesome perks to studying in legacy land: when the lunchtime bell rings, groups of sixth-formers flood down Celebration Avenue towards to golden gates of Westfield mall.\n\nOthers remain to eat their sandwiches in the lofty atrium of the upper school's drum, where the sharp white levels rise to an inflated roof of ETFE cushions, with the feel of a corporate office lobby. Two triangular lobes jut into this space on either side, housing science and technology labs, their faceted forms giving it all the look of a crumpled New York Guggenheim rotunda.\n\nAHMM have restrained their usual penchant for dousing everything in eye-searing colours, but there is one clever chromatic trick. As the floors rise, their balustrades are topped with thin bands of blue, red, yellow and green, reading as a stack of Olympic rings from the upper level \u2013 a mischievous retort to the International Olympic Committee's official ban on the use of their hallowed linked rings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lofty studios \u2026 inside the north-lit art rooms. Photograph: Timothy Soar/AHMM\n\nThe classrooms are bright, functional affairs, but the most spectacular spaces are saved for the speciality block. The upper level hosts vast double-height art and technology studios, washed with natural light (after which going to an art college will be nothing but a disappointment), while below sits a gargantuan sports hall and a state of the art theatre, complete with tech gantries big enough to hold a whole class of students. This, says the school's bursar, Dawn Revess, will be \u201cthe real community hub, the equivalent of the local village hall.\u201d So far it has hosted a talk by the Met Police commissioner and a couple of commercial conferences. Its role will be to provide a source of income as much as anything else.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn't need community centres,\u201d says Allford. \u201cThe school should be the centre of the community.\u201d It is a nice thought, and one which will hopefully come true for Chobham, once its strangely box-fresh surroundings are allowed to take on a life of their own. But it is a sentiment that is entirely at odds with the nature of contemporary schools, where fortification is valued over friendliness \u2013 a tendency particularly embraced by the slick cut-and-thrust world of academies, and even more so by the heavily patrolled context of the Olympic site.\n\nThe school's playing fields, on metropolitan open land to the north, are apparently open to the community, but it will be a brave and persistent soul who attempts to get through the multiple layers of fencing. But, if you're anywhere nearby, you should give it a go. There won't be many new schools built with such lavish facilities as this for a long time.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Architecture%2CDesign%2CArt+and+design%2CAcademies%2CSchools%2CEducation%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CLondon%2CRegeneration%2CSociety", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385025661987/7604d363-4e61-495b-ae66-910bcc72ddac-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2b7bcda5434d0fb88bfcd7cb2c76c1ff", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385026142825/dce9bd27-264a-4b83-98e1-cbf3e3564421-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=720687bf329b45f418e34acd7435f32a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385027198160/4e719f6f-cf01-4768-8106-e4f1a350e68d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1df97ee4d4851f431e7fc4c545970d7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/20/1384980877576/Michael-Gove-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=14a336a287de79f429638d6038d2c137", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/14/1384451488587/Skinners-Academy-Uniform-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff9968010051bffc955ce9135f81d47b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385026455941/6ed00426-be19-4b55-88c8-f8fe5de0390d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71c8516eb8f364975025e92ef9db8e4b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385027198160/4e719f6f-cf01-4768-8106-e4f1a350e68d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6f346db6fd52fca358989a65c761aa56", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385026728872/c6820f21-eccd-411c-afb1-888493e4f95b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8f3d5334f05cafaad854ed4b0634a5da", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/12/1389555094983/Education-secretary-Micha-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=06052734228363f1cc56c287f72ff436", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385026639823/020b1306-6a3b-415f-9a2e-40ba346a2cd9-1360x2040.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e0d7e52c16e8677ce192b49715c25e6"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/21/1385027198160/4e719f6f-cf01-4768-8106-e4f1a350e68d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6f346db6fd52fca358989a65c761aa56", "date": "22/11/2013"}, "rank_191": {"title": "Residents start making homes in Olympic village", "text": "Shardae Carr and her husband, Emile, got married six weeks ago, and last Friday, five days after they first laid eyes on it, the \"shiny brand new\" couple at last moved into their first home together.\n\nTheir move had been delayed by some months while the flat was finished, \"and we said, 'We'd better get in there and it had better be good.' But it was more than good,\" says Carr, gesturing at her wide balcony and expansive westward view of a newly planted green square. \"It was amazing \u2026 Definitely worth the wait.\"\n\nThe flat also has a unique history, having been the home, for a few glorious weeks last year, of two unnamed athletes from Team USA during the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nFifteen months after the last competitor left Stratford at the close of the Games, the first residents have this week begun to move into the former athletes' village, now renovated, replanted and rebranded as \"London's newest neighbourhood\", East Village.\n\nMore than 2,800 properties, from one-bed flats to 5-bedroom townhouses, have had temporary bedroom partitions removed and new kitchens fitted (the athletes all dined together in a communal canteen), ready for occupation not by sporting superstars but by ordinary Londoners. It is the first phase of a development that will eventually see 14,000 new homes built on a site the size of St James's Park. The new community comes with advantages that many London residents would covet. As a result of its Olympic investment, Stratford is one of the best-connected hubs in the city, while the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, as it is now known, will eventually reopen fully to house world-class sporting facilities on the new community's doorstep. A 2,000-place school, Chobham academy, has already partly opened, the health centre opened on Monday and a dentist, optician and other services will shortly follow.\n\nThe enormous Westfield Stratford shopping centre, meanwhile, whose infrastructure investment gave the Olympic Delivery Authority a significant boost in developing the site, will shortly be rewarded with tens of thousands of new potential customers right on its doorstep.\n\nThere was never any plan to mothball or demolish the athletes' accommodation, which was built with long-term use in mind, stresses Geoff Pearce, executive director of Triathlon, one of two property companies that will manage the homes. \"Our focus has always been on the legacy use, so if you look around you'll see things like really large balconies, fantastic private spaces. none of that was needed for the Games.\"\n\nAll Triathlon homes will be either rented or part-owned (no one on the site will fully own their property), with half of its first wave let to tenants nominated by local authorities, at rates equivalent to council house rents. A further quarter of tenants will be able to rent, like the Carrs, at an \"affordable\" level set between 20% and 30% lower than market rates.\n\nBut is not only the new residents who may come to consider they have struck gold in the most visible expression of London's Olympic legacy. Get Living London, the other property company onsite, is part owned by the Qatari sovereign wealth fund Qatari Diar, and it expects the East Village model \u2013 with thousands of properties rented at full market rate \u2013 to be such a lucrative one that it is planning to replicate the scheme on a smaller scale elsewhere in the capital.\n\nSoaring house prices mean people are renting for longer, in what chief executive Derek Gorman describes as a \"paradigm change\". \"We're seeing this as a clear marker of where London is going to go in future, and therefore we want to be part of it.\"\n\nWith his knowledge of London boroughs not extending much beyond EastEnders, Martin Tovee, who is moving to the capital from Macclesfield next week to take up a new job, admits he is most excited about the transport and retail links his new home will offer.\n\n\"But I just like the fact that I'm living where the Olympics was, it's something that I find quite exciting. Not so much that Mo Farah might have been sleeping in this apartment, but more that the legacy of the Olympics won't be forgotten and this will carry on as an Olympic venue, rather than be flattened by a bulldozer.\"", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Stadium", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/11/26/1385490475609/London-2012-Athletes-Vill-015.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d18db757e03c77fa11b4361c74139776", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2013/11/26/1385490475609/London-2012-Athletes-Vill-015.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d18db757e03c77fa11b4361c74139776", "date": "26/11/2013"}, "rank_91": {"title": "London's Olympic village: first residents move in - video", "text": "The first residents of Stratford's East Village show us around their new homes - flats originally built to house 23,000 athletes during London's Olympic Games in 2012.

The promised Games legacy is that East London will catch up. How is it doing so far?\n\nThe fullest answer is provided by the Growth Boroughs Unit based at Hackney Town Hall, which is tracking and guiding progress in what were previously called the six \"host boroughs\" of Newham, Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Greenwich, Waltham Forest and Barking and Dagenham.\n\nBefore the Games these boroughs signed up to raising the social and economic life chances of their residents to the same levels as exist across the capital as a whole over a 20 year period. This goal is named \"convergence\" and the latest annual report from the unit presents the figures about what's been achieved at this stage. It's an enlightening read: encouraging in parts, sobering in others and raising important questions which future reports will seek to address.\n\nThe degree of convergence is measured against various yardsticks encompassing health, educational attainment, affluence, crime and neighbourhood-building. Pages 10 and 11 provide a quick guide to outcomes so far.\n\nThey bring good news about GCSE results, life expectancy, violent crime and numbers of affordable housing units built, although the Unit acknowledges that the word \"affordable\" increasingly refers to homes that are beyond the means of the least well-off. They're working on ways to reflect this in the future. The convergence picture is less cheering in terms of overcrowding, childhood obesity, earnings and employment.\n\nOne important factor, which most of the available data doesn't really capture, is the extent to which gentrification is influencing the stats. As we know from other studies, an influx of more affluent people into an area can have the effect of reducing the percentage of poor people living there and also the number of them, due to rising costs obliging them to move elsewhere especially if they are renting privately. The impacts of government welfare reforms are another element that needs to be tracked.\n\nThe Growth Boroughs Unit is working on all that too and has stressed to me that there is a lot of population churn of a variety of kinds across the six boroughs and beyond. Some of those moving out will be doing so because they can't afford to stay while others will be taking advantage of rising property prices to buy somewhere bigger elsewhere, sometimes within the six growth boroughs, sometimes somewhere else entirely. As a Hackney resident I know of former neighbours who've sold up and moved to larger houses in Waltham Forest. Another family that used to live nearby has, I learn, bought what is described as \"practically a castle\" somewhere in Scotland.\n\nWho will win and who will lose from the East End's ongoing regeneration? It's a complicated story, and one that is only beginning to be told.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=London%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSociety%2CRegeneration%2CHousing%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/27/1343382205144/Olympic-rings-in-east-Lon-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ec315c11c81edfd7d97559167f5a6d63", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/27/1343382205144/Olympic-rings-in-east-Lon-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bb4a9af3bbbf520ef237cde4c1e2adc", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/27/1343382205144/Olympic-rings-in-east-Lon-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bb4a9af3bbbf520ef237cde4c1e2adc", "date": "28/11/2013"}, "rank_32": {"title": "London 2012 Olympic Games legacy questioned as young people shun sport", "text": "\u2022 Figures reveal drop in young people playing sport in past year \u2022 Funding could be cut for sports that fail to achieve growth\n\nDespite the \"inspire a generation\" rhetoric used to justify the investment in the London 2012 Olympics, new official figures show that the number of 16 to 25-year-olds playing sport has gone down since the Games.\n\nThe latest Active People survey from Sport England, which invests \u00a3300m a year of lottery and government funding in grassroots sport and has a specific remit to increase the number of young people playing, shows regular participation among 16 to 25-year-olds has declined by 53,000 over the past year to 3.74 million.\n\nAmid heightened concern over a long-term increase in childhood obesity and the public-health implications of increasingly sedentary lifestyles, the numbers will make grim reading for those who claimed London 2012 would inspire more young people to play sport.\n\nHowever, there will be relief for the government and the London 2012 organisers that the figures show a marginal increase in the number of people playing sport overall compared with those compiled just before the Games.\n\nThey suggest that the coldest March for 50 years, which hit the numbers published in April 2013 and led to a fresh wave of concerns about the direct pledge to increase the number of people playing sport through the Games, has not dented participation figures in the longer term.\n\nDespite Andy Murray becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon in 77 years, tennis also continued to struggle to arrest a decline in participation, putting future funding at risk. The Lawn Tennis Association, whose new chief executive, Michael Downey, arrives from Canada next month, was one of a handful of governing bodies put in \"special measures\" by Sport England last year and warned that its funding would be cut if it did not improve its participation figures.\n\nBut Thursday's figures showed a decline from 423,400 to 406,000 in the past year. Since 2005, the number of people playing once a week has slumped from 457,200.\n\nThe number of people playing sport at least once a week is higher than at any time before the Games and, at 15.5 million, is 100,000 higher than the figure in April 2012. Sport England and the government prefer to highlight the fact that 1.5 million more adults are playing sport regularly than when the bid was won in 2005.\n\nBut the figures also show that while 12 sports have increased participation on a 12-month rolling basis compared with the previous set of figures in April, 19 have suffered a decline or seen no change. Football, cricket and netball have suffered the most and Sport England's chief executive, Jennie Price, warned that the FA, which receives \u00a330m over four years from the organisation, had to \"get its act together\", particularly when it came to encouraging more young people to play.\n\nShe said that she had held four meetings with the FA general secretary, Alex Horne, on the subject in the past nine months and called on it to be more innovative, working more closely with local councils and commercial five-a-side operators.\n\n\"They don't have large-scale participation on the ground. They've got to build that core of regular participation,\" she said. The sports minister, Helen Grant, reiterated her warning that the governing bodies face having their funding cut if they fail to deliver.\n\nThe number of 16-year-olds and over playing football has gone down from 2.02 million to 1.84 million since 2005, when the Active People survey began.\n\nPrice said more emphasis would be placed on so-called \"doorstep sport\" schemes that appealed more to young people and more unusual offerings such as korfball, dodgeball, zumba and dance that had proved more popular than formal team sports. \"We've got to give them a range and make sure it's not just a choice between sitting on the sofa and formal, organised sport,\" she said.\n\nWhile insisting that Lord Coe, who promised to \"inspire a generation\" through London 2012, had provided a \"great platform\", Price admitted that most of the growth was being driven by an increase in informal exercise such as running, cycling and going to the gym.\n\nAmong the success stories, British Cycling trumpeted the fact that more than two million adults were now riding bikes at least once a week, making it the third most popular sport in Britain behind swimming and athletics, overtaking football.\n\n\"Yes, it's hard yards. But we have to remember we bumped along under 15 million for an awful long time. This is serious long-term behavioural change work,\" said Price.\n\nAn earlier promise to increase the number of people playing sport three times or more a week by one million, and a parallel promise by the NHS to increase the number of people taking exercise by the same number, were quietly dropped before the Olympics when it became clear they would not be met.\n\nOther positive trends from the latest survey include a record number of disabled people playing sport at least once a week, up 62,000 in the past year to 1.67 million, and a record number of people from BME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) backgrounds, to 2.7 million.\n\n\"This shows that more people are continuing to play sport and the growth we saw in 2012 was not just a post-Olympic bounce. I am particularly pleased to see record numbers of disabled people playing sport, which is a real testament both to the impact of the Paralympics and our increased investment in the grassroots,\" said Price.\n\n\"We are concerned about the results for young people \u2013 although the majority of 16 to 25-year-olds still play sport regularly, the numbers are not going up. The evidence shows a sharp drop in the popularity of traditional sports like football and netball, and we need to make sure they have a wider range of sporting activities to choose from.\"\n\nGrant said she was \"encouraged\" by the figures but said there was \"more to be done\", warning governing bodies that their funding would be withdrawn and channelled through other routes if they did not hit their targets. Sport England invests \u00a3493m over four years through governing bodies.\n\n\"Sports governing bodies must step up and deliver for the half a billion pounds of public money that they receive,\" said Grant. \"If they don't, funding will be taken away and channelled into grassroots sport through other routes.\"\n\nThe MP Clive Efford, Labour's shadow minister for sport, said: \"These damning figures underline the fact that David Cameron has no strategic plan for sport. His Tory-led Government have failed to capitalise on the explosion of enthusiasm generated by the Olympics and Paralympics. A golden opportunity is being squandered.\"", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2013/12/12/1386852549210/Mo-Farah-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1ea67b34742fdbb25d6ec54bada62260", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2013/12/12/1386852549210/Mo-Farah-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2789d6f4fea0693179f4a07cb11a11f8", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2013/12/12/1386852549210/Mo-Farah-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1ea67b34742fdbb25d6ec54bada62260", "date": "12/12/2013"}, "rank_47": {"title": "Olympics fail to create healthier and more active population, says survey", "text": "Health Survey for England finds a nation that fails to understand obesity problem and whose children fail to get enough exercise\n\nMost children are not getting the daily exercise recommended by the NHS and the promised Olympic legacy of a healthier, happier and more active nation has failed to materialise, according to figures from the Health Survey for England.\n\nThe 2012 survey of 8,000 adults and 2,000 children found that only 16% of girls aged five to 15 get the recommended hour of exercise a day, despite a nationwide push to get more playing sports.

More than a quarter of overweight men and a third of overweight women described themselves as a healthy size. Childhood and adolescent obesity was linked \"directly to middle-age mortality and morbidity\", according to the survey yet child obesity rates remain high.\n\nFourteen percent of boys and girls aged two-15 are classed as obese, and 28% as either overweight or obese. Nineteen per cent of boys and 17% of girls in the lowest income bracket were deemed to be obese compared with 8% and 7% respectively from the richest households.\n\nThe survey also noted that \"most adults in Britain drink alcohol, at least occasionally, and alcohol has an established place in British social life\".

In richer households, 81% of men and 69% of women had a drink in the last week compared with 51% and 39% in the lowest earning.\n\nEric Appleby, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, said alcohol abuse cost the NHS \u00a33.5 bn a year. \"These statistics show that there are still far too many of us drinking too much too often putting us at risk of serious health problems, like cancer and stroke.\n\n\"We're facing historically high levels of health harms caused by alcohol misuse, with over a million alcohol related hospital admissions each year; and we're one of the few European countries where liver disease is on the increase.

However, it will host five rugby World Cup games in summer 2015 during a pause in construction.\n\nThe London mayor, Boris Johnson, who must convince that the park and its proposed 6,800 houses will deliver for residents in the borough of Newham and the city as a whole, insisted the plans already outstripped those of any other Olympic host city.\n\n\"Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park has delivered an astonishing legacy, and reopening the south part of the park will delight thousands of Londoners and visitors to our city,\" he said.\n\n\"No other Olympic city has come close to London's success in delivering a lasting legacy of sporting venues, jobs, homes and simply wonderful parklands.\"\n\nChobham Academy, the school on the fringes of the park, welcomed its first pupils in September last year, and in November the first residents started moving into the 2,818 flats that once made up the athletes' village.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=London%2COlympic+legacy%2CArchitecture%2CZaha+Hadid%2CAnish+Kapoor%2CHousing%2CArt%2COlympic+Games%2CUK+news%2CSport%2CCities%2CGreen+space%2CParks+and+green+spaces", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/14/1389727408578/Queen-Elizabeth-Olympic-P-004.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a78e761fe74850a315db5d1f59caaef6", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/14/1389727408578/Queen-Elizabeth-Olympic-P-004.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=505fc774dde8f967ea543852470489fa"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/14/1389727408578/Queen-Elizabeth-Olympic-P-004.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=505fc774dde8f967ea543852470489fa", "date": "15/01/2014"}, "rank_140": {"title": "London Aquatics Centre ready to open its facilities to general public", "text": "2012 Olympic venue is relaunching with a swim for as little as \u00a33.50, as well as providing training facilities for elite athletes\n\nMichael Phelps, Ryan Lochte, Tom Daley and Ellie Simmonds were the heroes in the aquatics centre during London 2012, but members of the public now have the opportunity to make waves in the same building.\n\nFor the first time since the Olympics and Paralympics, the London Aquatics Centre will open its doors to the public, for as little as \u00a33.50 per session, with the London Legacy Development Corporation describing this Saturday's venue relaunch as a key moment in the aftermath of the Games.\n\nThe LLDC chief executive, Dennis Hone, also revealed that negotiations over sponsorship of the building have yet to be completed, with the organisation waiting until naming rights have been secured for the Olympic Stadium before any deals are put in place for other venues across the Olympic Park. Whoever earns the naming rights for the stadium, which will be West Ham's home from 2016, may want exclusive sponsorship over the whole park for a potential 10-year period.\n\nThe aquatics centre, run by Greenwich Leisure Limited (GLL) and housing two 50-metre swimming pools as well as a diving pool and other training facilities, will stage the Fina Diving World Series in April and the 2016 European Swimming Championships. While it will be open to the public from this weekend, elite athletes such as Daley will continue to use the site as a training venue, and it is also the base for British Diving.\n\nBoris Johnson, the London mayor, said: \"After a post-Olympic makeover London's majestic aquatics centre is now flinging open its doors for everyone to enjoy, whether an elite athlete or enthusiastic amateur.\"\n\nWhen asked about the Olympic Park's future title sponsorship, Hone claimed that a number of \"blue-chip\" organisations had already been in discussions with International Management Group, which is leading the negotiations. Sainsbury's has been mentioned as one potential bidder. The LLDC chief executive insisted that the eventual sponsor would be an \"active partner\" in continuing the legacy of London 2012.\n\nHone said: \"We want a sponsor that isn't just putting a name on this but is an active partner in what we're trying to achieve on the park and the legacy we're trying to build. If you're a naming-rights sponsor, you may want access to players and you may want other facilities.\n\n\"We're looking for a naming-rights sponsor for the main stadium this calendar year and they may look at secondary rights over some of the other facilities. We've got interest, I am very confident, given the general level of interest we've had. We need to work closely with West Ham on the [sponsorship] package. This is another part of our plan to create a new heart of the city with world-class sporting venues open to the community as well as new homes and jobs.\"\n\nSince the end of the London Games the aquatics centre has undergone a significant transformation. The building, designed by Zaha Hadid, has had its capacity reduced from 17,500 to 2,500 seats and will be used by Sport Relief for its national Swimathon in March .\n\nThe conversion of the entire Olympic Park from its original state in 2012 is set to cost \u00a3300m. The aquatics centre follows the Copper Box Arena, which hosted handball and goalball during the Games, which became the first venue to be opened to the public.\n\nPeter Bundey, the deputy managing editor at GLL, said: \"This venue is now ready to become one of the best aquatics facilities in the world. It will be a place of fun and fitness, as well as competitive swimming. Activities will range from learning to swim, to family-fun sessions, to a world-class competitive venue.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/2/25/1393354788408/Aquatics-Centre-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=450fa19a17fa63e2128f8d0cd2121919", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Swimming%2CDiving%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/2/25/1393354788408/Aquatics-Centre-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb002add4a25d39a95a1fa30204525e2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/James-Riach,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3f9fadd59c5c2e44bf7b50f672323f17", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2014/2/25/1393354788408/Aquatics-Centre-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=450fa19a17fa63e2128f8d0cd2121919", "date": "25/02/2014"}, "rank_181": {"title": "London Aquatics Centre: Take a Daley dive or Adlington dip at \u00a33.50 off-peak", "text": "The 2012 Olympics and Paralympics proved \u2013 as the nation went into collective rapture over the performances of Jessica Ennis, Ellie Simmonds and Mo Farah \u2013 that everyone wants a piece of the elite athlete experience. Now we can have it.\n\nSaturday's opening of the London Aquatics Centre allows mere mortals to experience the vertiginous terror of standing on the 10-metre high diving board graced by Tom Daley. You too can use the 50-metre Olympic swimming pool where some 17,500 people cheered on Rebecca Adlington.\n\nAll this for just \u00a33.50 off peak (\u00a34.50 peak time), a price based on the average cost of a session in one of the London Olympic borough's public pools.\n\nThe crowds buzzing through the Zaha Hadid-designed building, its distinctive wave-like roof resting on just three concrete supports, seemed impressed by its atmosphere. Even the non-sporty could not fail to appreciate a building whose three pools contain 10m litres of water and which is lined with 180,000 tiles.\n\nBill Noble, a Great Britain transplant sport swimmer who has won a clutch of gold medals and has swum in many of the world's top pools, was full of praise. \"It's absolutely superb,\" he said. \"I normally swim at the Aquatic Centre in Manchester, but this is very different. There is so much light.\"\n\nLooking down forlornly on the pools from a viewing platform at the entrance were Gavin Everall and his daughter Astrid, from nearby Hackney Wick. They had turned up for a swim, but the last 50 tickets had just sold out. Nevertheless, they were excited after securing tickets for a swim on Sunday.\n\n\"This is going to be our local pool,\" Everall said, nodding in approval. \"I'm not a huge fan of Zaha Hadid's work, but this looks great. It feels really organic.\"\n\nPeter Bundey, deputy managing director of GLL Sport Foundation, the not-for-profit organisation running the centre, describes it as \"the ugly duckling that became the swan\".\n\nAfter the Games, much of the seating was removed as the walls were peeled back so that huge panes of glass could allow the light to flood in, providing stunning views of the ArcelorMittal Orbit and, more prosaically, the Stratford Westfield shopping centre. \"It's the standout venue,\" Bundey said. \"There's a feel of a cathedral about it. It's currently the best swimming pool in the world.\"\n\nThe huge number of smiling helpers, guides, security guards, lifeguards, cleaners and attendants were a clear sign that those behind the centre know what is at stake.\n\nThe much-promised legacy of the Games will be ruined if any one of its main venues fails to bring in the community, a key aspect of the London 2012 bid.\n\nWork is under way to transform the Olympic Stadium into a multi-use venue that will be home to Premier League West Ham United and a national competition venue for UK athletics.\n\nThe Copper Box Arena, where the Olympics handball competition was held, has been open since July 2013. This month the Lee Valley VeloPark opens its doors and, in May, the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre will open for both community and elite use.\n\nBut the Aquatics Centre is the big ticket item. Get this wrong and everything that follows will be tainted. Critics of the Olympics will not be slow to reheat their complaints.\n\nNot that Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, appears worried.\n\n\"After a post-Olympic makeover, London's majestic aquatics centre is now flinging open its doors for everyone to enjoy, whether an elite athlete or enthusiastic amateur,\" he said. \"All of the world-class sporting venues on the magnificent Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park have secured bright futures, dispelling fears of white elephants and helping to drive our ambitious regeneration plans for east London.\"\n\nthere was something of a festival feel about the place. ADJ played Robin Thicke while synchronised swimmers dipped, dived and pouted. Children ran around excitedly. A new generation of elite divers queued for the boards. A lot of selfies were being taken.\n\nThe centre will still, despite its heavy public ethos, host elite events such as the 2014 World Diving Series and the 2016 European Swimming Championships. Daley normally trains in the diving pool, now home to the GB elite team, twice a day.\n\nCharles Johnston, property director of Sport England, which invested \u00a334m of National Lottery funding, said it was hoped the public would be inspired by seeing their heroes up close. \"Our investment has ensured a truly iconic facility is open to the community, transforming it into a place where elite and everyday swimmers can train side by side.\"\n\nUp to a point. I felt a small thrill run through me as I ascended the steps to the diving board, imagining what must have been going through Daley's mind when he took bronze in 2012. Bravely, I walked to the edge of the board. Bravely, I looked down. Bravely, I contemplated the graceful way I would arc through the air and hit the water with the tiniest of splashes. Then, very carefully, I turned round and walked back down the steps.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CLondon%2CSwimming%2CSwimming%2CSport%2CUK+news%2CZaha+Hadid%2CArchitecture%2CArt+and+design%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/3/1/1393689331211/The-London-Aquatic-centre-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5709cb74d98ca87ed488631bd12743bb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/3/1/1393689331211/The-London-Aquatic-centre-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4ed7324f5b39c024542fa6b8d780b3ac", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/3/1/1393689331211/The-London-Aquatic-centre-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4ed7324f5b39c024542fa6b8d780b3ac", "date": "02/03/2014"}, "rank_169": {"title": "London's Olympic velodrome set to welcome cycling public", "text": "It is the fastest velodrome in the world, according to Jez Cox, the man running the former London 2012 cycling track. Now the swooping, wood-clad bowl where Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, Sarah Storey and the rest whizzed to their medals will be open to those pedalling at distinctly more sedate speeds.\n\nThe precipitously banked 250m track is finally available for public use from Monday, getting on for two years since the start of the Games. The Olympic BMX track is also opening\u201a with some of the steeper jumps whittled down\u201a and there are new mountain bike routes and an enclosed road cycling circuit.\n\nThe sense of legacy does, however, come with a caveat. Bookings at what is now officially called the Lee Valley VeloPark are being snapped up almost as soon as they are released, but cycling campaigners say the rush to two wheels remains a largely sporting phenomenon, with limited progress on the wider post\u2011Olympics promise of more everyday activity.\n\nA particularly jarring symbol of the divide is the distinctly mixed state of the cycle routes leading to the Olympic Park, with one ending in a distinctly bike-unfriendly flight of steps.\n\nEven British Cycling, the sporting body that masterminded the nation's unprecedented haul of 16 cycling golds from the Olympics and Paralympics, says more should be done to encourage mass cycling.\n\n\"Without doubt the Olympic and Paralympic Games had a phenomenal impact on the number of people cycling, not just for sport but for cycling to work or just for fun,\" said Chris Boardman, a velodrome gold medallist at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, who is now British Cycling's policy adviser. \"However, there is only so much further that number can rise without some serious improvements to accommodate cycling on our roads. We know that almost two in three people would like to take up cycling, but perceived safety fears are stopping them.\"\n\nThese wider worries notwithstanding, the advent of the VeloPark is another big moment for the former Olympic site, after the opening of the Aquatics Centre last month. Much of the rest of the site remains fenced off for building work.\n\nThe cycle centre is a significant venture, with more than 300 shiny new hire bikes and a roster of coaches to impart skills such as mastering the fixed-gear bikes used in velodromes and negotiating the tightly packed rises and dips of the BMX circuit.\n\nWith some sessions fully booked until the end of 2014, the main challenge for Cox and his team is to ensure such a complex operation works smoothly from day one.\n\n\"There will be some things that are still unfolding when we open, but that's normal. We don't want to open with too rigid a way of working,\" he said.\n\nOne dry run came when the velodrome hosted part of the Sport Relief telethon, Cox noted during a tour of the centre. \"Freddie Flintoff crashed over there,\" he said, pointing to a bend on the wood-panelled loop. \"In fact we just yesterday finished filling in the hole he made in the track with his pedal.\"\n\nThe cycling complex is built over a somewhat more shabby but much-loved facility, the Eastway circuit, which hosted road and mountain bike races for more than 30 years until it was levelled to make way for London 2012.\n\nPeter Walker tests out the new public cycling facilities at the Olympic velodrome in east London. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian\n\nCox was among thousands of young riders introduced to the sport at Eastway, and he recalls his sadness when it closed in 2006: \"I was racing in France and came back to do the last meeting. I finished the race, kissed the track and cried. A lot of people did. It was somewhere they grew up, and was really special. If there's one thing I can do with this place it's give other people the same feeling.\"\n\nThe wider issue of mass cycling is some way beyond the remit of Cox and his colleagues, but there remains the risk of the VeloPark becoming a symbol of wider British attitudes to bicycles \u2013 fine when they involve Lycra and gold medals, but not something for everyday use.\n\nThe \"embarrassing\" cycling infrastructure surrounding the east London complex bears witness to this, according to the London Cycling Campaign (LCC).\n\n\"Before the Olympics, politicians were queuing up to explain the tremendous legacy we should expect from the event in encouraging Londoners to be more active, in particular how it would increase cycling and walking,\" said Mike Cavenett of the LCC. \"But looking now, there have been very few concrete improvements to the way our city streets make cycling safe and inviting for ordinary people. The embarrassing state of the cycling facilities inside the Olympic Park typifies how low a priority cycling often is with urban planners.\"", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/28/1396006022004/Peter-Walker-velo-park-012.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c447f094db9ed9c15e2b448143ed7d2", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Cycling%2CLife+and+style%2CCycling%2CSport%2COlympic+legacy%2CUK+news%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396014797603/Peter-Walker-tests-out-th-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=da3aaf4629335d73dd51779fcc1608cf", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/3/28/1396006022004/Peter-Walker-velo-park-012.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c447f094db9ed9c15e2b448143ed7d2", "date": "28/03/2014"}, "rank_153": {"title": "London's \u00a312bn Olympic park opens up to the public", "text": "Almost 10 years and \u00a312bn in the making, the full extent of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will finally open to the public on Saturday, revealing \"the biggest new park in Europe for 150 years\", magicked from the mud at the bottom of the Lea Valley.\n\nStretching for 230 hectares (568 acres) around a knotted tangle of waterways and rail lines, it is, says its maker, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), the size of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens combined, home to forests and wetlands, lawns and meadows, dotted with a velodrome and aquatics centre, a stadium and arena \u2013 the long-awaited spoils of the two-week sporting circus.\n\nIn the 19 months since the euphoria of the games subsided, \u00a3300m has been spent on adapting venues, planting trees and moving minor mountains. The northern half of the park, composed of neatly sculpted Teletubby mounds fringed by swaths of wildflower meadows, reopened in July and has already received a million visitors. A further 3 million are expected in the coming year, now that the final piece in the jigsaw is complete with the opening of the southern park, conceived as a \"Southbank for the East End\".\n\n\"We imagined it as a place for performance and play, markets and festivals, circuses and events,\" says its designer, James Corner, who is best known for transforming New York's derelict elevated railway into the acclaimed High Line park, weaving wild planting along its raw industrial structure. \"We've brought a similar idea of linear choreography and movement, designing the park as a sequential experience of outdoor rooms, connected by an arced promenade of trees.\"\n\nThe \"rooms\" take the form of three circular paved areas, lined with assorted benches and stepped seating, as if awaiting an impromptu public performance. They will host carousels and helter-skelters, music and poetry readings, and will one day be ringed by beds of tall grasses, planted by Dutch horticultural alchemist Piet Oudolf, who also worked on the High Line.\n\nThis sequence of spaces is framed at either end by low-key play areas: there is a fun interactive fountain and a thicket of wooden poles supporting a small rope bridge. A water pump gushes into a sandpit, while chunks of granite and orange concrete walls tilt at jaunty angles. But, given the number of expected visitors, particularly once the main stadium is up and running from 2016 (reborn with retractable seating as a place for concerts, athletics, and the new home for West Ham United), it all seems oddly under-scaled, suggesting long queues of impatient children.\n\nLooming over these bits and pieces is the lunatic tangle of the ArcelorMittal Orbit, a monument to a steel magnate, which is now strewn with an assortment of breeze-block sheds at its base and encircled by a big fence, making it as awkward at ground level as it is on the skyline. It has been joined by a boxy new visitor centre by Make Architects, a practice not known for its subtlety, but which has here managed to produce something mercifully restrained.\n\nThe sum of these disparate parts feels strangely unthought-through, belying the number of committees and review panels that preside over the production of every piece of the Olympic legacy. It also feels less park than plaza, more like an extension of the adjacent Westfield shopping centre than the nearby Victoria Park, or the wild Lea Valley that stretches for 40km to the north.\n\nThe power of James Corner's work elsewhere comes from how it responds to what was already there, but given a blank slate \u2013 the jumble of industrial fragments that were on the site having been long since trampled beneath the Olympic carpet \u2013 it all falls a bit flat. Just as parts of the north park feel as if they have been lifted from a Florida golf course, this world of beige tarmac and play equipment, garnished with the occasional ornamental lawn, could be anywhere.\n\n\"It is not supposed to be 'of' the area,\" says LLDC chief executive Dennis Hone. \"It is 'for' the area. It's a place for people to come and enjoy activities free of charge, and we want the life of the park to bleed into the surrounding neighbourhoods.\"\n\nHe lists the forthcoming developments that are intended to bring such life, from the imminent transformation of the vast broadcasting shed into a tech hub and data centre, to the future arrival of a satellite of the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as an \"exciting new model of an open campus\" for University College London.\n\nThere will be 6,000 homes across five new neighbourhoods within the park, as well as the gargantuan commercial centre of the \u00a32bn Stratford International Quarter, which will see 4m square feet (370,000 square metres) of office space in a complex of swollen glass blocks, designed by an unholy alliance of second-rate corporate architects. Given the quality of buildings that have sprung up on the overheated fringe of the Olympic site, there is not much to inspire confidence that what comes next will be any better.\n\nA wall of steroidal apartment towers line Stratford High Street to the south, dressed in cheap plastic cladding, with more bulky apartment blocks to the west, while the monstrous hulk of a 1,000-room Unite student accommodation block is rising to the north-east \u2013 given permission by the same planning team that will be judging the forthcoming schemes.\n\n\"It's not my favourite building,\" admits Hone, averting his gaze from the beige ziggurat that steps in clumsy chunks up to a 28-storey terracotta tower, like something more at home in Pyongyang. \"But we have a planning process, and we can't make perverse decisions.\"\n\nRefusing permission for such a scheme might seem perverse in the eyes of its developers, but it will be essential if the rest of the park is to develop into decent piece of London. As long as those in charge of balancing the books hold more sway than those overseeing quality control, the Olympic legacy will be one of commercial compromise over considered place-making.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400688076907/e030aa97-c36e-4ac8-95f7-c3e622b4b1c6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=84f11f805b66e1b0a3ddc18da1dae868", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/2/1396465512395/Children-play-at-the-Quee-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f55ea4c54ecd15e591e7c7ad8e7c7700", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Stadium%2CUK+news%2CArchitecture%2CLondon%2CSport%2CDesign%2CArt+and+design%2CCulture%2COlympic+Games", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/26/1403781682584/Hyde-Park-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e8c7d6c3c0a2803d1afb5b684511c807", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/commercial/2011/6/8/1307558774785/High-Line-park-in-New-Yor-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b4c86abc23c9358ff8614a7d2f668073", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/2/1396465512395/Children-play-at-the-Quee-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=749936da7cf65399cc88b0711891bd86"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/2/1396465512395/Children-play-at-the-Quee-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=749936da7cf65399cc88b0711891bd86", "date": "02/04/2014"}, "rank_172": {"title": "Your Ad Here - in pictures", "text": "The world is dotted with caf\u00e9s and restaurants in which impoverished artists once paid a bar bill by painting on the tablecloth or the wall.

Now, almost two years after London was taken over by Olympic fever, the park has just reopened for public use and the ambitious plans for its legacy can be finally put to the test. The park has received a facelift to make it a green and spacious environment: 4,300 new trees have been planted and four new outdoor spaces added on top of the miles of waterways, acres of woods and habitats for wildlife. From the nature and mountain biking trails to the Olympic pool, we look at the what's on offer in the capital's newest playground.\n\nSPORTS VENUES\n\nLondon Aquatics Centre\n\nWhether it's the possibility of spotting Olympian Tom Daley or the architectural allure of Zaha Hadid's curvaceous construction, the London Aquatics Centre \u2013 which opened to the public in February \u2013 is already proving a popular attraction. The futuristic municipal design, which is matched with a calming, advert-free interior, is worth checking out whether you plan to swim or not. The high-spec, 50-metre Olympic pools (yes there are two, one concealed underground), have 10 and eight lanes respectively. The more daring \u2013 or attention-seeking \u2013 can chance a dive off the ominous concrete diving blocks at the far end of the building.\n\n\u2022 020-8536 3150, better.org.uk/london-aquatics-centre. Open Mon-Fri 6am-9.30pm, Sat-Sun 9am-5pm. Entry from \u00a32-\u00a37\n\nLee Valley Velopark\n\nThe Velopark is a hub for cyclists of every discipline: those out for a rocky ride can cruise the 390-metre-long BMX track, which has been adapted from the one used in the Games; the indoor track (the fastest in the world) in the distinctive Pringle-shaped velodrome, on which Britain had so much success in 2012, is also open to the public; and the floodlit road circuit is suitable for serious stamina training as well as being a great place to learn to ride. There are also three graded mountain bike trails opening in May. One of the best things about the Velopark is that you don't even need a bike; you can hire everything you need on arrival, making it the perfect place to try out new and unfamiliar styles of riding.\n\n\u2022 08456 770 603, visitleevalley.org.uk/velopark. Open Mon-Thurs 9am-5pm, Fri-Sun 9am-8pm. Prices vary depending on the activity but sessions start at \u00a34 for children and \u00a36 for adults; bike and helmet hire \u00a36 concession, \u00a310 adults\n\nThe Copper Box Arena\n\nThe venue for handball, fencing and goalball during the Olympics, the Copper Box is now a multi-use sports space for fitness fans. The venue \u2013 which is probably going to be more attractive for locals than day trippers \u2013 features a sparkling new gym as well as activity space where you can take part in anything from Zumba to badminton, but you don't need to be a member to visit. The 6,500 seater venue is also still hosting events \u2013 such as mixed martial arts tournaments, heavyweight boxing and pop concerts \u2013 and is also the home of the London Lions basketball team.\n\n\u2022 020-8221 4900, better.org.uk/copperboxarena.

Pay and play activities from \u00a33-10\n\nLee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre\n\nFeaturing two professional hockey pitches (the best in the country) as well as six outdoor and four indoor tennis courts, this centre is, like the Copper Box, likely to be well attended by those turning up to train. Still, anyone eager for a game of tennis can just turn up and play. It is also a regional hub for wheelchair tennis and for the next three years will host the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Masters.\n\n\u2022 Opens in June 2014, visitleevalley.org.uk/lee-valley-hockey-tennis\n\nATTRACTIONS\n\nThe Orbit\n\nIf you're looking for a game to play as you stroll around the park, try coming up with new ways to describe Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond's sculptural behemoth. The tri-mangled crane? The red-metal devil? The smelter helter skelter? Whatever you decide to call it, the sculpture, made of 2,000 tonnes of steel and the largest in Britain, really is sight to behold. And the view from the top's not bad either. At around 100m high, the viewing platform offers visitors the chance to absorb the rapidly changing London skyline, from the blocky, boom-time skyscrapers of Canary Wharf to the more delicate shapes emerging in the city centre. To save your legs, our advice is to get the lift up, and walk the spiral staircase down.\n\n\u2022 0333 800 8099, arcelormittalorbit.com. April 1 -September 30 , open daily 10am-6pm, last entry 5pm; October 1-31 March, open daily 11am-5pm, last entry 4pm. Adults \u00a315, children \u00a37\n\nTimber Lodge Cafe\n\n\n\nA solar powered eco-eatery that's been designed to blend into its surroundings, the Timber Lodge Cafe is also a social enterprise. Unity Kitchen, who run the cafe, spend their profits on creating jobs for disabled people in the local area as well as emphasising the importance of healthy, affordable food. The spacious wood-walled building is the perfect place to regroup and refuel, just take your pick from the fairly-priced menu that includes everything from Moroccan salads to hot pot dishes, all going for a few quid.\n\n\u2022 020-7241 9076, unitykitchen.co.uk/unity-kitchen-cafe. Mon-Sun 9am-5pm\n\nTumbling Bay Playground\n\nParents can sit and relax while their kids run wild in this playground right next to the cafe. There are rickety (looking) walkways, rock pools and treehouses, sandpits, wobbly bridges, slides, swings and even some modern art \u2013 the Cross and Cave sculpture by Heather and Ivan Morison \u2013 hidden amongst all the play things.\n\nSouth Plaza\n\nIn the shadow of the main stadium \u2013 which will not reopen, as West Ham United's ground, until 2016 \u2013 is the relandscaped South Plaza. The area through which spectators walked on their way into the Olympic park now consists of illuminated tree-lined boulevards, modern play parks and a mini amphitheatre for outdoor performances. There's a climbing wall for children that slopes down to the canal, as well as sandpits, water features and fountains. Designed in part by the team behind New York's much loved High Line, the space is a place to play, relax and explore.\n\nGo for a tour\n\n\n\nTo learn about the history of the park, the ideas behind the architecture and the spectacle of the Games, sign up for a tour with one of the Blue Badge Tour Guides offering walks around the site. The guides, who have personal knowledge of the project, will tell you about how the site is being developed for the future as well as sharing London's Olympic and Paralympic story. A whole range of new types of tours and walks will become available over the summer.\n\n\u2022 queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/trailsandtours. Tours run every Thursday and Saturday at 11am, starting outside Pudding Mill Lane DLR station. Adults \u00a310, concessions \u00a38, children \u00a35\n\nFollow the trail\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of the park's post-Olympic makeover is the addition of four interactive trails that lead visitors through the 560 acres of parkland. There is a children's trail, which includes \"secret missions\" to encourage kids to explore, and an art trail, which shows you round the public art commissioned as part of the Olympic legacy. You can collect the free trail guides from the Information Point at the entrance to the park, opposite the Aquatics Centre.\n\n\u2022 queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/trailsandtours", "images": ["https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/14/1355481875679/Martin-Parrs-M-Video-Chri-003.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/static/6d5811c93d9b815024b5a6c3ec93a54be18e52f0/common/images/logos/the-guardian/travel.gif", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396877629031/Lee-Valley-Hockey-and-Ten-008.jpg", "https://hits-secure.theguardian.com/b/ss/guardiangu-network/1/JS-1.4.1/s985205503180623100?ns=guardian&ndh=1&c19=frontendarchive&AQE=1&ch=Travel&ce=UTF-8&AQB=1&cpd=2&v9=D=g&pageName=Travel:London+holidays:Article:queen-elizabeth-olympic-park-london:2072996&v14=D=r", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396877993620/The-Orbit-008.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396878237385/Timber-Lodge-Cafe-008.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396878421025/Copper-box-indoor-multi-s-008.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/16/1355699281989/sports-peronality-2012-003.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396885032968/Olympic-Park-008.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396875799089/The-aquatics-centre-008.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396875972830/Lee-Valley-VeloPark-008.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/13/1355391391855/Kimon-a-long-tailed-monke-001.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396885234583/Signpost-at-the-Olympic-P-008.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396880418904/The-newly-transformed-Sou-009.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396884723029/Tumbling-Bay-Playground-008.jpg", "https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396887736271/A-cyclist-rides-past-the--009.jpg", "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396887736271/A-cyclist-rides-past-the--009.jpg"], "top_image": "https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2014/4/7/1396887736271/A-cyclist-rides-past-the--009.jpg", "date": "08/04/2014"}, "rank_170": {"title": "Olympic Park basks in legacy afterglow but where are the signs of glory? | Richard Williams", "text": "Swimmers ploughing up and down the lanes of Zaha Hadid's aquatic centre, novice track cyclists wobbling on to the banked turns of the velodrome, gym rats pounding the running machines in the Copper Box: this has been a big week in the afterlife of London 2012, the moment at which the reality behind all the legacy promises could be properly glimpsed for the first time.\n\nMore than 50,000 people visited the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park last weekend as the site became fully open to the public. On a breezy day in midweek there were still plenty of families taking advantage of the school Easter holidays to wander among the surviving landmarks of the historic festival of sport, discovering what possibilities the vast site might offer for future pleasures.\n\nThey found pleasant walkways fringed with beautifully designed wooden benches, plenty of refreshment stands, a few handsome rocks arranged around the paths, the occasional curiosity such as a machine that, when a handle is wound, reproduces the noise of the stadium crowd in full cry, and lots of features to divert the attention of children: a grassy bank to roll down, a climbing wall to clamber up, a water feature to get soaked in, an old-fashioned helter-skelter, and the distance of Greg Rutherford's gold medal-winning long jump marked out in green paint on a strip of asphalt. And, of course, the biggest curiosity of all: the crumpled latticework of Anish Kapoor and Cecil Balmond's tower, now open to visitors and likely to divide opinion for as long as it remains erect.\n\nThose who made the half-hour walk from the entrance near the Westfield shopping centre all the way to the park's northern edge found themselves standing at its highest point and gazing at its single most resonant feature: not any of the architectural marvels but the five giant Olympic rings, cast in steel and mounted on poles at the top of Alfred's Meadow, above a bank of cowslips leading down to the River Lea.\n\nHere is the most evocative and enduring reminder of all the feats witnessed two years ago, during the breathless interlude in which we stopped moaning and saw what we imagined to be the best of ourselves. Those who pose for family photographs under the rings will find themselves thinking of Jessica Ennis, Bradley Wiggins, David Weir and countless other athletes who surpassed themselves during those magical days.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee controls the use of its symbol so strictly that this is the rings' only appearance in the park, making it all the more powerful. The much criticised London 2012 logo is also conspicuous by its absence, although memories are stirred by the colour combination \u2013 magenta, lime green, sky blue \u2013 familiar from signs, posters and volunteers' uniforms during the Games, and now used on banners that flutter from tall poles fringing some of the walkways.\n\nThe impression of open space is almost overwhelming: although visitors can see the London skyline, they feel closer to the Essex countryside. But this sensation will not last. Come back next year and a housing development called Chobham Manor will have sprung up on the levelled space next to the velodrome. In 2016 the International Quarter, a cluster of high-rise office blocks by the southern entrance, close to Westfield, will be welcoming its first tenants. Other residential areas \u2013 Sweetwater, adjacent to the Copper Box; Pudding Mill, south of the stadium; Marshgate Wharf, near the aquatic centre; East Wick, on the site of the temporary hockey stadium \u2013 will begin to fill the spaces as the years ago by.\n\nBy 2030, according to the schedule, this will be not so much a huge park as a city annexe with green spaces running through it. A sense of the urbanisation to come is already conveyed by the presence of a busy four-lane highway, splitting the park in two along its waistline, requiring walkers either to take the steps down to an underpass or wait for the lights to stop the traffic.\n\nPrivate development is taking over from public initiative, as we always knew it would. The \u00a39.3bn investment in the Games swept away an old landscape bedraggled to the point of disreputability but much loved by some, in order to provide a shiny new platform on which the towers of capitalism could rise, with their associated high-end living quarters.\n\nBut at least the place seems to have a genuine future, and the transformation \u2013 whatever one thinks of the way an extra \u00a3150m of public money is being used to ease West Ham United into the stadium \u2013 is being carried out reasonably quickly and efficiently. Faster, for instance, than the Australians have managed with Homebush Park, the epicentre of the 2000 Games, where development is continuing at a more gentle pace. In bankrupt Athens, the 2004 Olympic Park remains much as it was described two years ago by the Guardian's correspondent: \"No testament to past glories \u2013 instead it is indicative of misplaced extravagance, desolation and despair.\"\n\nIn Beijing, where homes were destroyed rather than built in order to house the 2008 Games, the continued existence of the spectacular Bird's Nest and Water Cube is defined less by their relevance to the daily life of the city's inhabitants than by their success in joining the Forbidden City and the Great Wall as essential tourist destinations \u2013 and as symbols of China's emergence as a global economic superpower.\n\nAt least there is nothing overtly vainglorious about the new incarnation of the Olympic Park. From some angles, even the Orbit seems like an outbreak of harmless British eccentricity. Whatever the flaws of the place, it feels as though it exists for people to use, whether bankers in the swimming pool or families picnicking by the River Lea.\n\nBut there is not enough here to remind visitors of the reason the park was created in the first place. Where is the equivalent of those handsome panels that once flanked the entrance to the old Wembley, recording the names of all the winners at the 1948 Games (and now housed within the rebuilt stadium)? It's hardly necessary to go as far as Mussolini, who ordered the Stadio dei Marmi, a miniature arena in the shadow of Rome's Olympic Stadium, to be girded with heroic statuary evoking the glories of the imperial past.\n\nOf course the best possible memorial will be the sight of future generations using the facilities to the full. But something a little more explicit would be welcome, paying tribute to the amazing deeds that once took place in these reclaimed marshlands.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/4/11/1397222349910/Queen-Elizabeth-Olympic-P-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e1ade682287dac706c43570ca670419", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport%2COlympic+Games+2012", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/4/11/1397222349910/Queen-Elizabeth-Olympic-P-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=70fde2be18b529c3cfce48f89d42111e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Richard-Williams,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b29e5d912fb9e36ac3aafcd6d2d5f62e", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2014/4/11/1397222349910/Queen-Elizabeth-Olympic-P-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=70fde2be18b529c3cfce48f89d42111e", "date": "11/04/2014"}, "rank_107": {"title": "Stratford's Olympics legacy: boon or bust?

Johnny Rotten\u2019s words as he departed the stage for the last time as a Sex Pistol seem strangely appropriate as we approach the 10th anniversary of Seb Coe\u2019s spine-tingling speech in Singapore that won the 2012 Olympic Games for London.\n\nThe promise was that hosting the Games would not only deliver a glittering bank of memories but, for the first time, deliver a fitter population in a country that took sport seriously for all that it could do in terms of its health, education, wealth, happiness and social mobility.\n\nIn short, we would all become a bit more Scandinavian in our attitude to knitting sport into the everyday life of the whole population and a bit more Dutch, German or French in our attitude to the municipal funding of communal facilities.\n\nThe seductive vision was that \u00a39.3bn invested in hosting the Games would not only hasten the regeneration of a neglected corner of east London and unlock a host of other benefits, but would act as a corrective in Whitehall to the attitude of politicians towards sport.\n\nNo longer would it be left at the back of the policy queue when it came to funding discussions. Instead it would be incorporated into policies on fighting obesity, tackling crime, boosting educational achievement and bringing communities together.\n\nFast forward to February and, with the general election in May looming, the sports minister, the Conservative Helen Grant, and her two shadows, Clive Efford (Labour) and John Leech (Liberal Democrat), gathered in a half-empty committee room in Westminster to go through the motions in a depressingly dreary debate about sports policy.\n\nIt was as though the Games had never happened, such was the paucity of ambition on display. It was also abundantly clear that while Grant, in post for the past 18 months, was doing her best to make progress on one or two issues, she had little commitment from her bosses or sway with the Treasury.\n\nIf pushed, those around the cabinet table will pay lip service to the positive power of sport. They may even turn up to the odd photo opportunity from time to time if a new 3G pitch is being opened in their constituency. But a properly integrated, properly funded, cross-departmental plan for sport and wellbeing remains as frustratingly elusive as ever.\n\nMeanwhile childhood obesity rates continue to rise, PE in schools continues to decline, provision of facilities remains frustratingly patchy and participation figures suggest a widening gap between the sporting haves and have nots.\n\nA year into his job, the culture secretary, Sajid Javid, finally gave his first speech on sport on Wednesday . He spoke with some conviction about sport\u2019s role in changing lives and using data more effectively to enable sport governing bodies to better husband their resources. But with parliament due to be dissolved on 30 March, it was little more than hot air. More ominous still were hints about further funding cuts to come.\n\nNowhere in the glossy brochure produced by the government on Wednesday entitled A Living Legacy does it mention the deep, damaging cuts to local authority budgets that have disproportionately affected sport and recreation. Across the country, facilities have been closed or hived off into private hands and schemes designed to reach those poorer communities have been cut.\n\nNor does it mention the fact that in the past year the number of people playing sport for at least half an hour a week has decreased by 125,100 as a result of a decline in the number of those swimming regularly. Or, even more disturbingly, that the decline among those in the lowest socio\u2011economic groups was more than 470,000.\n\nFar from turning us into a sporting nation, we are in danger of turning into a two tier one. Those sports that continue to increase their participation figures should, in theory, be the most accessible. Cycling and running are by their nature democratic, open to almost anyone.\n\nBut all the signs are that even in those sports the main growth is coming from those who have the time, the money and the opportunity to buy the kit, enter mass participation events and buy the expensive GPS sports watch.\n\nThe debates are the same ones we have been having for a decade. How to better unlock facilities in private clubs and schools for the use of the wider community? How to develop and deliver more coaches who can engage properly? How to foster basic physical literacy and a love of sport in primary school age children?\n\nSir Robin Wales, the Mayor of Newham, can be an acquired taste and as a Labour loyalist is fiercely partisan. But given that his council is one of those at the sharp end of the cuts and the closest to the Olympic Park, he is worth listening to on the impact of cuts to school sport and local authorities in the wake of the Games.\n\n\u201cWhat did government do? It cut funding to school sport straightaway. Then it cut massively to local government. Who does sport? We do. And schools do. So if you cut them both, of course sport is going to slip down the agenda. The truth is that this government doesn\u2019t care. It mouths those platitudes but it doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nMinutes after the culture secretary had left the estimable Michael de Giorgio, founder of grassroots sports body Greenhouse, spoke.\n\nHis complaints are familiar: not enough good coaches are being produced who can properly engage; too much money is being poured into getting the middle aged and middle class to do more sport and too little into reaching disadvantaged groups.\n\n\u201cThere are no more people playing sport today than three or four years ago. There is 50% of the population who are active and 50% who aren\u2019t. We should be spending the money on people who don\u2019t play sport,\u201d he said.\n\nSport England chief executive, Jennie Price, insists she is working on a plan to reach those disadvantaged communities, having spent a decade focusing on driving up numbers.\n\nCoe has done his best to clear up the mess, helping to repair some of the vandalism wrought by Michael Gove when he tore up the successful network of School Sports Partnerships and took away their ring-fenced funding.\n\nAfter a brutal battle, the government agreed to a \u00a3150m primary school sport premium. Yet primary schools are not getting enough help or advice in how to spend that money. A recent report from the Youth Sport Trust painted a \u201cbleak and worrying\u201d picture of declining levels of PE in schools.\n\nThere are, of course, spots of encouragement. Some of those listening to Javid on Wednesday represented the sort of grassroots and doorstep sport bodies that deserve a bigger chunk of government funding. But even if their enthusiasm is heartening they are kicking against the prevailing tide rather than swimming with it.\n\nThe wider argument about the extent to which hosting a major sporting event can produce wider lasting benefits will go on and deserves more space than can be afforded here. In his new book Circus Maximus, the academic Andrew Zimbalist calmly and persuasively debunks many of the overblown legacy claims made by host cities and the International Olympic Committee.\n\nOf those, the promise that London would become the first Olympic host to use the Games to produce a healthier nation is in danger of being shown up as nothing more than an idle boast. If that is to change the next government, however it is formed, will need to show more application and appetite than the current one.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CSebastian+Coe%2CSport", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/3/25/1427311417575/The-Olympic-Stadium-was-t-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=89411ac1e094b688b79242a0f5084e82", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/3/25/1427311417575/The-Olympic-Stadium-was-t-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c52f26b2e7bd56182d06599ac193366c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/3/25/1427311417575/The-Olympic-Stadium-was-t-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c52f26b2e7bd56182d06599ac193366c", "date": "25/03/2015"}, "rank_158": {"title": "What will Boris Johnson\u2019s legacy to London be?", "text": "Classicist that he is, Boris Johnson will be familiar with the Ephebic oath, sworn by the young men of ancient Athens, that among other things they would leave their city better than they found it. Johnson is technically still mayor of London for another year, but it\u2019s clear that his attention is now on that special corner of the capital that is the parliamentary constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, and on the gateway that it offers either to a place in David Cameron\u2019s next cabinet or to a useful position on the starting grid for the post-Cameron leadership contest. So even if he has not quite left the building, it is a good moment to ask whether, in terms of its physical fabric, Johnson is leaving London better than it was in 2008.\n\nIt is certainly different, and will be more so when the delayed effect of construction projects, which take a long time to realise, is felt. The man who campaigned on the promise not to create a Dubai-on-Thames is now in charge of a city where 263 towers of 20 storeys or more are in the pipeline, many of them Dubai-esque, some of them on the Thames, most of wretched quality and limited usefulness. He has backed the much disliked plans for Mount Pleasant and Bishopsgate Goodsyard. Icons, such as the ArcelorMittal Orbit, the tallest sculpture in Britain, have unfurled. The streets are bright with the blue of bike lanes he has promoted, and red with his reincarnations of the classic Routemaster bus. Out in the Thames estuary shimmers the computer-generated mirage of the island airport he fought for, almost certainly in vain. Less conspicuously but more usefully there are a number of not-bad housing projects, with such things as larger balconies and higher ceiling heights than they might otherwise have had.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson in 2011, launching Thomas Heatherwick\u2019s new Routemaster buses, \u2018their blinginess at odds with the originals\u2019. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images\n\nHis legacy, indeed, is a surprising combination of the spectacular and the workaday, where the well-known figure of Johnson the media tart sometimes gets in touch with his unexpected wonkish side \u2013 or, at least, a side prepared to support wonkery in his underlings. Between these poles are major changes to the city touched by a certain casualness, and an eagerness to attract investment from whatever source.\n\nThe classic Johnson project combines an eye-catching proposition and the promise of private sector funding that will leave the public purse unbroached, followed by the revelation of some catches in the small print, the occupation of a piece of the public domain by corporate interests, and the discovery that the project is not turning out as wonderfully as hoped. The classic of these classics is the cable car called the Emirates Air Line, in honour of its sponsor of almost the same name. In return for being the first company to get its name printed (twice) on the underground map, Emirates would, at no cost to the taxpayer, provide an important transport link between Emirates Greenwich Peninsula, close to the O2 arena, and Emirates Royal Docks, a site of future regeneration.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The St Andrews-by-Bow development in east London, designed by Allies & Morrison \u2013 an example of \u2018decent, dignified\u2019 housing.\n\nIt turned out that the deal came with strings attached, at least until they were revealed in the press and then disowned by the mayor: no construction contracts with companies with connections to Israel; no criticism allowed of the airline, government or royal family of the United Arab Emirates, by either Transport for London or the mayor. Cost overruns meant that the public ended up paying at least \u00a324m for the project, which is used by a fraction of its capacity. By 2013 the total number of users who could be called regular commuters was four; by 2014, zero. Also in this category were the Orbit (which as well as being widely disliked trampled on a nascent plan to connect the Olympic Park better with its surroundings), the ill-conceived Garden bridge, whose wide range of opponents include St Paul\u2019s Cathedral and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and the mercifully unrealised London River Park, which would have floated a string of corporate marketing and hospitality opportunities along a stretch of the north bank.\n\nBy 2013 the cable car\u2019s total number of users who could be called regular commuters was four\n\nYet the same mayoralty has produced a sober document called the London Housing Design Guide, which calmly sets out some basic standards for civilised homes \u2013 minimum ceiling heights and room sizes; balconies you can actually use \u2013 which, as homes tend to last a long time once built, is an important gift to the future. It was pushed through despite opposition from developers, and with the help of mayorally supported pilot projects such as the St Andrews development in east London, and has led to an outbreak of decent, dignified housing where formerly there was junk. Some of its recommendations are now being applied to housing across the country.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Emirates Air Line cable car, which links the O2 in Greenwich to the Royal Docks and has cost the public at least \u00a323m. Photograph: Image Broker/REX Shutterstock\n\nThere are things called housing zones, which promise to apply design and infrastructure investment intelligently to the provision of new homes, even if they risk forgetting other vital uses of the city, such as places of work, in their quest for dwellings. Johnson has also made declarations of love for the city\u2019s public spaces and high streets, which has resulted in brutal traffic gyratories being rearranged, upgrades of parks and pavements, the \u201cdecluttering\u201d or removal of superfluous barriers and signs, and such things as the impressive-looking, if flawed and expensive, remaking of Exhibition Road in South Kensington. Overall the effect is patchy and sometimes tokenistic, but more is promised for high streets. These works are still more substantial than Ken Livingstone, with an unfulfilled promise of \u201c100 public spaces\u201d, achieved.\n\nSomewhere between the follies and the eyesores at one end and the thoughtful wonkery at the other, come works such as the new Routemaster bus and the development of the Olympic \u201clegacy\u201d. The Routemaster project was an admirable plan to restore the functionalist elegance of the classic London double-decker that ended up with a vehicle that is better looking than recent alternatives, but with technical eccentricities and a blinginess at odds with the spirit of the originals. With the housing being built as part of the Olympic legacy, design has been given enough importance to ensure the hiring of above-average architects, and some intelligent planning, but there are signs that later phases may be dumbed down. There is also the \u201cOlympicopolis\u201d plan to bring institutions such as the V&A and University College London to the area (great), but then overload the site with money-raising housing (is there no alternative?).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest One of the capital\u2019s new cycle superhighways. Photograph: Michael Kemp / Alamy\n\nThe common themes to this new version of London \u2013 let\u2019s call it \u201cJohnsondorf\u201d \u2013 are a love of headlines combined with a light touch that lets the mayor\u2019s lieutenants get on with their jobs. The best achievements of Boris Johnson\u2019s mayoralty are down to the better people on his staff. Its weaknesses include the inability to co-ordinate the works of different underlings and a tendency to favour the getting of big bucks or instant hits over more considered, longer-term thinking. The resulting landscape is a curious mix: thoughtful but under-funded public spaces overshadowed by crass monuments and investment towers. Off to the side might be some nice Design Guide housing, perhaps a cycle superhighway doing its good work, but crashing through what would otherwise be a pleasant street.\n\nClassicist that he is, Johnson will also be familiar with the system of school grades that runs from alpha plus to gamma minus, with extra minuses or pluses to taste.

It\u2019s time for a change,\u2019 says sports minister\n\nThree years after the London 2012 Games promised to \u201cinspire a generation\u201d, the new sports minister has promised an urgent review of sport policy in the wake of \u201cvery disappointing\u201d participation figures that show that the number of people playing sport at least once a week has declined by 222,000 in six months.\n\nSuch is the level of concern over the lack of progress made from the \u00a3493m invested over four years into 46 sports governing bodies that the entire system is likely to face a top-to-bottom overhaul.\n\nIn search of the real Olympic legacy | Letters Read more\n\nFor the second reporting period running Sport England\u2019s figures have shown a serious fall, leading the shadow sports minister, Clive Efford, to declare them a \u201cdisaster\u201d and a call for urgent cross-party talks to stem the decline.\n\nHe warned that any new initiative must be more than a \u201csticking plaster\u201d, amid fears that any new strategy from the sports minister, Tracey Crouch, will not be enough to reverse the effects of government cuts to local authority budgets.\n\n\u201cI am very disappointed by these numbers,\u201d said Crouch. \u201cA significant amount of public funding has been invested in sport in the last decade but the results simply aren\u2019t good enough. It\u2019s time for a change. The recent downward trend in participation has demonstrated that the current approach has had its day. It\u2019s not the return we expect to see for a large investment of public money.\u201d\n\nThe figures also show the number of people playing no sport at all had increased by 1.2 million on last year. Almost six in 10 adults still do not play sport regularly.\n\nSport England\u2019s figures show that between October 2014 and March 2015, 15.5 million people did some kind of sport once a week, every week.\n\nThat figure hit a high of 15.9 million in October 2012 in the wake of the London Games, leading to confident claims that Britain could deliver where no previous Olympics had done and inspire a lasting uplift in participation.\n\nHowever, the trend is now firmly in the wrong direction. There are widespread fears that Britain is becoming a two-tier sporting nation, with the figures showing that lower socio-economic groups are doing less and less sport.\n\nSport England continues to put pressure on individual governing bodies that it feels are not performing but Crouch intends to construct an entirely new strategy for the next four-year funding period from 2017.\n\n\u201cI will consult with the sector on a new approach that will strengthen sport across the country, focus support on those that can deliver the goods and look to take a more joined-up approach to sport and physical activity across Whitehall,\u201d she said. Before London 2012 the system was recalibrated to funnel around 40% of Sport England\u2019s annual spend through national governing bodies such as British Cycling, the Football Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board.\n\nThe decline is also more pronounced among those sports that rely heavily on local authority facilities, with swimming recording the biggest decline. Gym and keep fit also recorded its first decline since the current measuring system began, falling by 153,000.\n\nGovernment cuts to local authority budgets have led to disproportionate reductions in sport and recreation spending, which tends not to be ringfenced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s showing government cuts are having a major impact on facilities and participation. The last coalition government set about destroying everything that had been put in place to make the most of the legacy,\u201d said Efford.\n\n\u201cThere is some fundamental rethinking that needs to go on at Sport England about how they use their resources. We can\u2019t go on the way we are. We\u2019re not getting enough cut through in the right places.\u201d\n\nEfford offered to sit down with Crouch in an effort to reach a cross-party consensus on the best way forward. \u201cUnfortunately what we keep getting is a sticking plaster to cover up a set of disastrous figures,\u201d he said. \u201cMy challenge to the government would be: sit down and talk to us. Let\u2019s get together a long-term, cross-party plan to deal with this.\u201d\n\nThe Sport England chief executive, Jennie Price, said that the Amateur Swimming Association had to work better with local authorities and leisure operators to make pools more attractive and to encourage casual swimmers. The number of people swimming once a week has plummeted by 390,700 in the past year alone.\n\nThe ambition to increase participation through spending \u00a39.3bn on hosting the London Games has long proved contentious.\n\nWhile the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games were firmly focused on delivery, there was little thought given to legacy. Locog chairman Lord Coe had a shortlived role as a legacy ambassador in the Cabinet Office but soon left to pursue his other roles.\n\nA lack of joined-up thinking across Whitehall departments and an initial concentration on persuading those already active to exercise more rather than tempt those who had never played or were lapsed back into sport also stymied progress.\n\nPrice said governing bodies that were delivering could expect to see their funding maintained but suggested that many others would face major cuts.\n\nBasketball and running were among the sports to deliver increases in the latest set of figures. Sport England\u2019s budget is also likely to come under renewed pressure in a new round of cuts this autumn.\n\n\u201cThere are governing bodies that can deliver growth. There are governing bodies that can change and improve \u2013 the LTA is a good example of that,\u201d said Price. \u201cBritish Cycling is an example of a governing body that does a great job. But there will be a tougher, more nuanced approach.\u201d Price pointed to its approach in basketball, where it now works alongside a range of charities and other delivery partners as well as the governing body, as a possible way forward.\n\nShe said the LTA had also revolutionised its approach to participation, focusing more on park tennis and links with local authorities, and had seen an increase of 38,200 to 422,400 a week as a result.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Sport+England%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport+politics%2COlympic+Games%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CUK+news%2CSport", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434046536267/Newcastle-City-Pool-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b33e6cc717393ec61371cca0b99a86d8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434046536267/Newcastle-City-Pool-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c1e81090ecaf998013e61059b503db65", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434046536267/Newcastle-City-Pool-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b33e6cc717393ec61371cca0b99a86d8", "date": "11/06/2015"}, "rank_11": {"title": "Britain\u2019s Olympic legacy is a sedentary nation | David Conn", "text": "The vacuous sales pitch that hosting the 2012 Olympics in London would inspire the nation to be more active has finally suffered a terminal blow, with the revelation in Sport England\u2019s latest half-yearly survey that 220,000 fewer people did sport of any kind than in the previous six months. The total number of adults taking part in sport now stands at 15.5m, 35.5% of England\u2019s population. So, three years since the nation thrilled to watch Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis-Hill and the rest of Team GB, 64.5% of over-16s are doing no sport or exercise for even half an hour each week. Sport England\u2019s figures show that the number of people swimming has fallen by 729,000 in the last decade.\n\nThis is not a surprise. Despite research by Tony Blair\u2019s policy unit confirming that hosting a televised mega-event does not greatly encourage regular people to do more sport, in 2005 Blair went as prime minister to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore and made exactly that claim. His and the next coalition government sanctioned spending \u00a39.3bn public money on three weeks of elite sports, and neither Blair, Lord Coe nor anybody else who took the plaudits is being held to account for the failure to build a participation legacy.\n\nMichael Gove\u2019s first acts of as education secretary in 2010 was to abolish school sport partnerships\n\nWest Ham United are of course the great Olympic winners \u2013 taking possession next year, for a relatively modest rent, of the stadium built and converted for football with \u00a3640m of public money, a fabulous boost to the value of their shares for the club\u2019s owners David Sullivan and David Gold, and their long-term executive, Karren Brady, now ennobled as a Conservative peer.\n\nConfronted by the figures showing the drop in participation, the newly appointed sports minister, Tracey Crouch, said she was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d and pledged to urgently develop a new strategy, and \u201clook to take a more joined-up approach to sport and physical activity across Whitehall\u201d.\n\nIf she is serious, she will need to see beyond the minutiae of earnest programmes run by sports governing bodies, funded by Sport England\u2019s annual budget of just \u00a3300m, mostly from the national lottery. The participation figures note a wide, permanent inequality in sports participation between economic groups. Currently 39% of wealthier classes do regular sport, a 1% increase since 2005. A markedly lower proportion, 26%, of less well-off people do sport: a 1.5% drop since 2005. So almost 75% of people in poorer sections of society do no regular sport at all.\n\nThe Olympics were themselves a glamorised exercise in inequality, given that 41% of Team GB\u2019s medal-winning athletes had been to private schools compared with 7% of pupils nationally.\n\nThe divide between state schools\u2019 mostly cramped sporting provision and the lavish playing fields of Britain\u2019s public schools \u2013 attended by most of Crouch\u2019s government colleagues \u2013 has only become more pronounced. After a scandalous decline under the previous Conservative administration, PE in state schools was slowly rebuilt by the last Labour government from just a quarter of pupils doing two hours a week in 1997, to 93% in 2010.\n\nIn search of the real Olympic legacy | Letters Read more\n\nOne of Michael Gove\u2019s first acts as education secretary in 2010 was to abolish school sport partnerships, which had worked cost-effectively to glue activity together in local areas. David Cameron mocked as \u201cpathetic\u201d the number of pupils doing competitive sport at state schools under Labour, but Gove also cut the requirement for schools to document it, so now we cannot know how many take part under the Tories.\n\nThe class divide is reflected in adult life too. Fitness sessions in private gyms were down in the last six months, but exercise generally is becoming more middle class, taken by people with time, some money and a standard of living that includes sport in the routine.\n\nExperts such as Chris Gratton, an adviser to Sport England, have found consistently that poverty and inequality are crucial barriers to people taking part in sport. To genuinely help people be more active and experience sport\u2019s mental and physical health benefits requires decent local facilities, space and sports development staff, combined with awareness campaigns and restriction on the food and drink industry\u2019s relentless marketing of unhealthy products.\n\nIf Crouch seeks a new strategy across Whitehall, she will need to talk to George Osborne, whose multibillion-pound cuts to local authorities are biting into sports facilities and seeing staff laid off. The chancellor\u2019s plans for \u00a312bn welfare cuts will further prevent millions of people from leading healthier lives.\n\nSport always reflects the culture it is played in, and sadly the latest figures expose an unequal, mostly sedentary nation, being led in the wrong direction.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639dee7942c30ab1cc84d018b1265b071dbd37df/689_55_3423_2056/master/3423.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc23b3880d04f71d104b0a4b0e6c2f47", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/David-Conn,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b938091e640223126af0fe98e538ca2f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434370231333/Olympics--009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=010a5954f05fc211b25b87655348e9e3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434370231333/Olympics--009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e8afecf7c005aba45531bd29ec380b7d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1bddd7555ff12db1fd9b17bada2eac56c0c80f4/0_285_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b562bf35d462124afa8bbb7fbadc83a0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games%2CSport%2CHealth%2CHealth+%26+wellbeing%2CLife+and+style%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434991605772/School-sport-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=454bb138e7b83a7405e2749bd712e203"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434370231333/Olympics--009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=010a5954f05fc211b25b87655348e9e3", "date": "15/06/2015"}, "rank_104": {"title": "Olympic Stadium cost rises to \u00a3701m from initial \u00a3280m estimate", "text": "\u2022 Price of transforming stadium for football and athletics up to \u00a3272m \u2022 Revelation likely to reignite row over use of public money\n\nThis article is more than 4 years old\n\nThis article is more than 4 years old\n\nThe overall bill for the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, largely met by taxpayers, has soared to more than \u00a3700m before West Ham United move in as tenants next year.\n\nIn a move likely to reignite the row over the amount of public money used to make the stadium suitable for both football and athletics, the London Legacy Development Corporation has confirmed the total cost of the transformation at \u00a3272m.\n\nWest Ham blow their season-ticket trumpets but who pays for the tune? Read more\n\nOriginally the Olympic Stadium was priced up at \u00a3280m in the London 2012 bid book before the price tag rose to \u00a3429m. The latest announcement, following the last of the contracts being signed, takes the total cost of the stadium to \u00a3701m.\n\nIn April the Guardian revealed that the LLDC had opened itself up to a decade of potential challenges over whether the deal broke European Commission state aid rules by not applying for prenotification.\n\nThe final confirmed cost of the transformation, towards which West Ham will make a \u00a315m contribution on top of the \u00a32.5m they will pay annually for a 99-year lease, is significantly higher than the \u00a3154m originally announced when the deal with West Ham was agreed.\n\nOlympic promises fail as fall in sporting activity reveals a divided nation | Richard Williams Read more\n\nThe LLDC argues that it never announced a final budget for the transformation and that the \u00a3154m figure was the cost of its initial contract with the contractor Balfour Beatty.\n\nThe final cost takes the 54,000-seat stadium, which will host the Anniversary Games next month and Rugby World Cup matches in September, towards the \u00a3780m spent on Wembley.\n\nWithout allowing for inflation, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff cost \u00a3121m in 1999 and Arsenal\u2019s similar-sized Emirates Stadium cost \u00a3390m in 2006.\n\nHowever, the LLDC would argue that the Olympic Stadium project was unusually challenging in engineering terms and involved effectively entirely rebuilding the existing structure.\n\nThe saga of the stadium\u2019s legacy has been long and tortuous. The initial plan was to remove the upper tiers of the stadium and scale it back to a modest 25,000-seat bowl after the Games.\n\nBut the coalition government and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, urged a rethink in 2010, reasoning that it was folly to in effect knock it down and that only football could provide a sustainable future. Following a bitter battle with Tottenham Hotspur, a deal was eventually agreed with West Ham that later collapsed under legal challenge.\n\nFollowing another tender process, the club were awarded a 99-year lease to share the stadium with other tenants including UK Athletics. The operator of the Stade de France was recently appointed to handle the running of the stadium and to book concerts and sporting events to supplement income.\n\nLast year the LLDC admitted that the cost had risen to \u00a3193.9m as a result of difficulties that Balfour Beatty was experiencing with the world\u2019s largest cantilevered roof.\n\nThe LLDC said that the deals it had signed with West Ham, who will in effect be the main tenants during the football season, and British Athletics, which is entitled to use for the whole of July, would ensure that it would not require continuing subsidy from the taxpayer.\n\n\u201cWe have invested in transforming a temporary athletics venue into a permanent world-class multiuse arena that has a secure and long-term sustainable future,\u201d said the LLDC\u2019s chief executive, David Goldstone. \u201cThis has required a significant amount of work and innovative engineering solutions.\n\n\u201cAlongside the transformation work the deals signed with British Athletics and West Ham United and the appointment of a stadium operator ensures the stadium will pay its way and not require any continuing subsidy from the taxpayer.\u201d\n\nWest Ham\u2019s long and winding road to the Olympic Stadium Read more\n\nThe largest chunk of funding for the transformation comes from a one-off settlement of \u00a3148.8m from the exchequer in 2010. On top of that Newham council has provided \u00a340m, West Ham \u00a315m, almost \u00a340m comes from the original \u00a39.3bn budget for the Olympics, a further \u00a325m from the government. UK Athletics has invested \u00a31m and the London Marathon Charitable Trust has provided \u00a33.5m.\n\nIn return for investing \u00a340m for a share in the special purpose vehicle that owns the stadium, Newham council has been guaranteed access to the stadium and up to 100,000 tickets a year to West Ham matches.\n\nWest Ham are set to move into the stadium, which will have 21,000 moveable seats designed to make it more suitable for football, at the start of the 2016-17 season.\n\nThe club\u2019s vice-chair, Karren Brady, who has sold out of some of the executive box offerings, has promised cut-price season tickets in order to fill the ground and make Premier League football more affordable.\n\nJohnson blamed a lack of planning by his predecessors for the cost of transforming the stadium into a 54,000-seat multipurpose arena.\n\nConcerned about the potential for delays and without a definite commitment from a football club, the Olympic board decided in 2007 to press ahead with plans to build the stadium with a demountable top tier that could be removed afterwards to bring the capacity down to 25,000.\n\n\u201cA very bad call was made when those in charge at the time backed a stadium construction plan that would leave the Olympic Park with a much smaller, mouldering and tumbleweed ridden arena following the Games,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFollowing that plan would have literally torn the heart out of the park and put at risk the incredible economic regeneration we are now seeing in east London.\n\n\u201cOur remedy offered long-term sustainable investment in order to protect an iconic stadium that Londoners took to their hearts, and which is now set to be home to almost every conceivable sport, concert or community event for decades to come.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve created a knockout venue that will drive and sustain thousands of jobs, where we\u2019ve ensured that a hefty share of the profits will be paid back into the taxpayers coffers and which provides a genuine Olympic legacy for our city.\u201d", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434716373751/Olympic-Stadium-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cb2560e47fe173b90b7bca2f573aa5e5", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434716373751/Olympic-Stadium-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7ac7f3409df9ec1aca8032cfc10d3fae", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Stadium%2CWest+Ham+United%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CSport%2CFootball%2CAthletics"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434716373751/Olympic-Stadium-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cb2560e47fe173b90b7bca2f573aa5e5", "date": "19/06/2015"}, "rank_16": {"title": "Olympic legacy failure: sports participation figures", "text": "London Olympics 2012 promised to leave the legacy of an inspired generation to inspire generations to follow suit so, three years on, how is it looking?\n\nLondon Olympics 2012 promised to leave the legacy of an inspired generation engaged in sport.\n\n\n\nSo, three years on, how is it looking?\n\nNumbers released on the amount of people playing sport regularly have been closely scrutinised since the big event\n\nAccording to the latest release of Sport England\u2019s annual active people survey, the number of people in England who regularly take part in sport is rising.\n\nBut is has the Olympic promise been kept? It\u2019s not that straightforward.\n\nWhen you compare the 15.5m people aged 16 years and over in England playing sport at least once a week during the year up to March 2015, to the 14.1m in 2006, then the number has indeed increased. And not just that: from 2008 the number remained fairly stable until a boost in 2012 - no doubt in part thanks to the Olympics.\n\nHowever since 2012, the number of people practicing sport for at least 30 minutes at moderate intensity at least once a week has slowly declined. Most recently the number of people participating in sport once a week fell by 222,000 compared with October 2014.\n\nWhich sports have had the biggest boost or slump since the Olympics?\n\nTaking six medals (four of these gold) the Team GB athletics squad did the nation proud at London 2012. Did well-known stars such as Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah help raise the profile of athletics? It was already one of England\u2019s most loved sports, being the third top sport for weekly participation pre-Olympics but by October 2013-2014, athletics became the second highest. During the year up to March 2015, more than 2.2m people regularly took part in atheltics each week - up by 328,100 on October 2010-October 2011.\n\n\n\nClose behind on the success stories is cycling. Maybe it\u2019s something to do with the truckload of medals the Team GB cycling team won at London 2012, the promises of investment in cycling infrastructure from the government or the effect of the Tour de Yorkshire, but cycling has done well. The number of people getting on their bike at least once a week reached 2.1m between October 2012-October 2013 (although it has dropped slightly in the most recent data). That\u2019s a boost of 258,700 people since before the Olympics.\n\nWeekly sports participation, 16+. England\n\nBut since 2005, the year Great Britain won the Olympics bid and the year from which Sport England calculate the difference, there has been an increase in weekly participation figures of 873,700 for athletics, 374,100 for cycling and 31,600 for table tennis.\n\nIt\u2019s not equally successful news for swimming and football, the two sports that have seen the biggest decreases in weekly participation. The downward trend in swimming is not new though - since October 2009 the number of people taking to the pool each week has been dropping.\n\nIn 2010, when the coalition government came into power, Labour\u2019s free swimming scheme got the chop and sports facilities have also suffered as a result of local council cuts.\n\nOther sports which have seen their popularity drop are badminton, table tennis and Equestrianism.\n\nSince 2005, swimming (-728,800), football (-140,100) and badminton (-66,800) are the Olympic sports which have seen the biggest decreases.\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the current downward trend in weekly sports participation continues, to reach pre-2005 levels - if so then many may consider the Olympic legacy to be a failure.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435932432412/8df87eb8-344b-491c-825f-193a9183a8c2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=909c43bd9db875dbdfbc3d7165a362e9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435932432412/8df87eb8-344b-491c-825f-193a9183a8c2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad1d847eedeaad3815407f4962dc924c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Sport%2COlympic+Games%2CSport+England%2CHealth%2CFitness", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435932432412/8df87eb8-344b-491c-825f-193a9183a8c2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=909c43bd9db875dbdfbc3d7165a362e9", "date": "05/07/2015"}, "rank_8": {"title": "Olympic legacy failure: inspiring London 2012 message has become a millstone", "text": "The \u2018Singapore promise\u2019 of leaving behind a legacy of a fitter, healthier nation and transforming the lives of young people looks further away than ever 10 years after London was awarded the Olympics\n\n\u201cInspire a generation.\u201d It was at the heart of the pitch that won the bid. It was the message that was plastered all over the Olympic Park in Stratford during that glorious period in July and August 2012. It was a proud boast that the London Olympics could do something no other previous Games had achieved. But it has become a millstone for all involved.\n\nOlympic legacy failure: sporting numbers plummet amid confusion and blame Read more\n\nWhat resonated most with the International Olympic Committee and the country was the \u201cSingapore promise\u201d of leaving behind a legacy of a fitter, healthier nation and transforming the lives of young people, together with regenerating a patch of east London and underlining the value of public investment in elite sport.\n\nThere were plenty of people, even then, who argued that investing \u00a39.3bn in a major sporting event was not the most effective way to transform the fabric of grassroots sport in the UK. But the seductive vision from Lord Coe and the then prime minister, Tony Blair, was that hosting the Games could provide a glorious one-off corrective that in addition to regeneration in London and economic benefits for Britain could transform the attitude to sport in Whitehall and beyond.\n\nNo longer an afterthought, it would become baked into health, transport, Home Office and education policy. At a valedictory press conference in Westminster the day after the Games, the then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, became visibly annoyed at a suggestion from reporters that his government would fail to do just that. But 10 years on from Singapore the chief executive of the London 2012 bid, Sir Keith Mills, is clear that it is the government\u2019s commitment to a co-ordinated strategy that is still sorely lacking.\n\n\u201cWe urged that government should have a national strategy for sport and inactivity; that hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d says Mills, who has put \u00a310m into an organisation called Sported that seeks to support grassroots sports clubs across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating because it\u2019s not rocket science. The problem in government generally is that it\u2019s not very joined up. Government has historically been quite good at plans but not very good at executing them.\u201d\n\nMills, who emphasises that other elements of the legacy have been a success, contrasts the cross-party consensus required to deliver the Games with the lack of joined-up thinking over the sports participation legacy. Blair told the IOC members on 6 July 2005: \u201cOur vision is to see millions more young people in Britain and across the world participating in sport and improving their lives as a result of that participation. And London has the power to make that happen.\u201d\n\nBy any measure, the figures for sports participation since the Games do not make pretty reading\n\nCoe talked movingly about his epiphany watching the 1968 Mexico Olympics and vowed that the London Games would \u201cshow a new generation why sport matters\u201d.\n\nFor all the ill-defined rhetoric around the ambitions for a legacy, a word that has become almost meaningless given the regularity with which it is now attached to major events, the Olympics minister who persuaded Blair to bid in the first place is clear what the two overriding aims were. \u201cWe had two reasons for doing the Olympics,\u201d says Tessa Jowell, who is standing to be Labour\u2019s candidate for London mayor. \u201cTo regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple.\u201d\n\nBy any measure, the figures for sports participation since the Games do not make pretty reading. Longstanding issues remain from a lack of coordination between schools, local authorities and sports clubs to a lack of recognition and remuneration for age-specific coaches and PE teachers. Exacerbated by a lack of a clear overarching plan across Whitehall departments, cuts and confusion in school sport and local authority cuts that have hit facilities budgets, adult participation numbers have fallen since the Games. More worrying, they suggest that increasingly we are becoming a two-tier sporting nation, with least progress being made among those in the lowest socioeconomic groups.\n\nSport England, the quango that invests \u00a3325m of exchequer and lottery funding in grassroots sport per year, last month published participation figures among adults that were damned as very disappointing by the new sports minister, Tracey Crouch. Her Labour opposite number, Clive Efford, called them disastrous. The figures showed that the number of people playing sport at least once a week had declined by 222,000 in six months. Meanwhile, the percentage of those on the lowest incomes participating in sport has hit the lowest level since records began in 2005-06.\n\nOlympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery Read more\n\nIn school sport, the decision by the then education secretary, Michael Gove, to cut \u00a3162m in ringfenced funding for school sports partnerships had far\u2011reaching consequences. The effects are still being played out, though the more optimistic hope that rearguard action to replace it with \u00a3150m a year for primary schools has mitigated the worst of the impact. Either way, London 2012 was not the transformative moment in terms of the importance placed on school sport that many had hoped.\n\nTen years on from the drama and delight of the \u201cSingapore moment\u201d, Crouch has promised to rip up the government\u2019s sports strategy and start again with a blank sheet of paper and a new green paper. Meanwhile, many of those who were intimately involved with the London 2012 journey, including Jowell and Mills, have called for a new 10-year, cross-party plan.\n\nFor all the golden memories of July and August 2012, already tinged in sepia, and the continuing debate about the success or otherwise of the other legacy aims it is hard not to conclude that a prize Jowell once called \u201cthe greatest in a generation \u2013 faster progress towards a healthier nation\u201d is not already close to being squandered.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/639dee7942c30ab1cc84d018b1265b071dbd37df/689_55_3423_2056/master/3423.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc23b3880d04f71d104b0a4b0e6c2f47", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1bddd7555ff12db1fd9b17bada2eac56c0c80f4/0_285_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=63df588ccf1aebae3b23ebe4fe8aa25d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1bddd7555ff12db1fd9b17bada2eac56c0c80f4/0_285_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b562bf35d462124afa8bbb7fbadc83a0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CSchool+sports%2CSchools%2CEducation", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/David-Conn,-L.png", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434991605772/School-sport-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=454bb138e7b83a7405e2749bd712e203"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1bddd7555ff12db1fd9b17bada2eac56c0c80f4/0_285_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=63df588ccf1aebae3b23ebe4fe8aa25d", "date": "05/07/2015"}, "rank_66": {"title": "Olympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery", "text": "Michael Gove\u2019s controversial decision to cut \u00a3162m of funding has left sport at the whim of headteachers and secondary schools receive no money to pay for it\n\n\u201cI love that my school is sporty,\u201d says 11-year-old Lily on a sunny morning at St Katharine\u2019s Primary in Bournemouth. \u201cI ran a 5k last week which I never thought I could do.

Her school is an exception: unified vision and strategy have been largely absent where physical education and school sport are concerned.\n\nOlympic legacy failure: sports centres under assault by thousand council cuts Read more\n\nTen years after London was awarded the 2012 Olympics, the access to sufficient PE and school sport for state school youngsters is, to a large extent, dependent on where they live. In an age where more than a third of children leave primary school overweight or obese, where one in four think a video game constitutes exercise and where the amount of weekly PE delivered has diminished significantly, it is pertinent to recall those pledges of legacy and an inspired generation back in 2005.\n\nPE and sport in state schools \u2013 which educate 93% of the nation\u2019s children \u2013 have undergone radical changes since 2010. While new schemes such as the School Games and primary school funding through an annual \u00a3150m premium have reaped benefits, the controversial abolition of School Sport Partnerships (SSPs) in 2011 has provided an unwanted legacy where opportunities vary greatly and a postcode lottery where accountability is minimal.\n\nThe decision by Michael Gove to scrap SSPs was met with widespread outrage and condemnation, the then education secretary ending \u00a3162m of ringfenced funding which served 450 SSPs nationwide, usually comprising six to 10 secondary schools and their feeder primaries. Within each SSP there existed a partnership development manager who promoted and organised sport between different schools and clubs in the community, while each secondary was funded to retain a PE teacher for two days a week.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible decision and there\u2019s no question that the situation is on the slide and deteriorating,\u201d says Chris Dunne, formerly the long-serving head at Langdon Park school in Tower Hamlets, east London, and currently chair of the newly formed London Headteachers Alliance. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good idea of what it\u2019s like around London and it\u2019s very, very patchy, although in Tower Hamlets we have continued to grow our provision. But it\u2019s left to individual teachers now and many don\u2019t have time. The main obsession is with the next Ofsted inspection.\u201d\n\nIn many ways the situation has been left to develop organically since the abolishment of SSPs, and a survey by the Smith Institute has found that a third of teachers reported a significant decrease in participation since 2011. In some areas, groups of schools and regional boards have pooled their resources, asking each school for a donation towards a fund used to pay staff who occupy similar roles to those previously operating under the SSPs. In others, not-for-profit organisations \u2013 such as the Tower Hamlets Youth Sport Foundation \u2013 have plugged the gap while in many a unified structure simply no longer exists.\n\nIn 2013, with anger against the government still rife, the department of education announced that \u00a3150m would be committed annually to the 17,000 primary schools in England for PE and sport through Primary School Premiums. Each receives a little over \u00a39,000 per year, with the premiums set to remain in place until 2020.\n\nOn the south coast, a stone\u2019s throw from the cliffs of Bournemouth, is an example of how the premium money can be put to good use. As part of the Youth Sport Trust\u2019s national school sport week, children at St Katharine\u2019s are all outside participating in exercise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pupil from St. Katharine\u2019s C of E School in Christchurch, Bournemouth takes part in an National School Sports Week event, which was organised by the Youth Sport Trust Photograph: Nick Treharne\n\nThe headteacher of five years, Nikki St John, has tried to make physical activity part of the daily routine, using the funding to train staff. Academic results have improved as a consequence. \u201cWe let our children climb trees, they have tarpaulins and make dens, they play in the mud with buckets and spades,\u201d says St John. \u201cWe use the outdoor environment as much as we can. Walking and talking. We want the kids to know that being active and walking makes them feel good.\u201d\n\nThere is ample evidence that correlates the amount of exercise a child does to improved performance in the classroom. However, some headteachers \u2013 many concerned about inspections \u2013 do not view PE and sport as a priority, a serious issue given that primary premium funding is used at the discretion of headteachers.\n\nMany, such as St John, coordinate an effective programme but some do not. Others have good intentions yet do not have a suitable local network around them, often hiring private firms to deliver after-school sport. The quality of such services varies drastically.\n\nMore concerning, though, is the lack of funding for secondary schools, who receive nothing from the government. The School Games, an initiative born from the Olympics which involves intra-school, regional and national competitions for all ages across a variety of sports, is regarded as a success. Organised by the YST, Sport England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, there are more than 19,000 schools participating.\n\nYet other than these games, the only guaranteed physical activity 11 to 16-year-olds receive in school is through PE. A YST study this year found that weekly PE time had significantly reduced in primary and secondary schools since the coalition took power in 2010. Baroness Sue Campbell, the organisation\u2019s chair, who has long campaigned for improved youth sport, has described the issues in secondary schools as a potential \u201ctime bomb\u201d.\n\nShe said: \u201cI praise what\u2019s happened in primary. There\u2019s a long way to go to create the sort of universal offer we all want but everybody is working collaboratively towards it. But the secondary issue is one we can\u2019t ignore. In terms of lifelong participation, if we build the momentum up to the age of 11 and then it all disappears it\u2019s really hard to re-engage again later.\u201d\n\nOlympic legacy failure: sporting numbers plummet amid confusion and blame Read more\n\nIt is a view shared by David Ellis, the headteacher at York high school, another establishment where sport is thriving. On numerous walls across the school are prints and images of Olympic heroes, from Haile Gebrselassie to Jonathan Edwards, but Ellis warns that a lack of leadership is having negative effects at secondary schools.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at a provision that is a wrap-around schools to make sure our young people engage,\u201d says Ellis, who played a key role in maintaining some of the structures in place across York from the old SSP. \u201cWe need a network of professionals to ensure that when young people leave school at 16 they do some form of physical activity, because often they are doing none at all.\n\n\u201cWe also need a PE curriculum that is inclusive. We don\u2019t expect 15-year-old girls to go out on a freezing cold field in January and play hockey. That doesn\u2019t happen here and many other schools have moved on too. Kids can get their physical activity in PE by going to the gym or doing a dance session.\u201d\n\nMany miles south, in the heart of Oxfordshire, a group of key stage 3 pupils have been up all night on rowing machines. At King Alfred\u2019s Academy, a secondary school in Wantage, PE staff have overseen a \u201cRow to Rio\u201d initiative where children are trying to reach a mileage target that marks the distance to Rio de Janeiro, host of the next Olympics.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pupils at King Alfred\u2019s Academy, Wantage, Oxfordshire attempt to \u201crow\u201d to Rio. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian\n\nSimon Spiers is the former headteacher and currently executive head of the Vale Academy Trust, where 51 of 52 schools pool sport funding in a setup he describes as superior to the previous SSP. In his office are boxing gloves used by Nicola Adams at London 2012, while Olympic values are imprinted on windows.\n\n\u201cOxfordshire is in a really good position,\u201d says Spiers. \u201cProbably in a better position than most places. But the secondary teachers are still worried whether they can retain their current offer for PE, especially for key stage 4 [pupils aged 14-16].

She pointed the finger at the coalition for axing ringfenced funding for school sport in 2010 and continuing to fund policies that were not working.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the wrong thing to promise,\u201d said Jowell, now on the shortlist to be Labour\u2019s candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election. \u201cWe were on track.

But the fact is that the coalition government allowed our very tight, deliberately targeted definition of legacy to become diffuse. I always knew that was a risk,\u201d said Jowell, who was part of the delegation that narrowly defeated Paris in Singapore in the final round to win the right to host the Games.\n\n\u201cWe had two reasons for doing the Olympics. To regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple. The mechanism was school sports partnerships and targets for physical activity and sports participation. It was very clear.

The Parkrun phenomenon began with a dozen friends and has inspired 400 events in the UK and more abroad. Events are free, staffed by thousands of volunteers. Runners range from four years old to grandparents; their times range from Andrew Baddeley\u2019s world record 13 minutes 48 seconds up to an hour.\n\nParkrun is succeeding where London\u2019s Olympic \u201clegacy\u201d is failing. Ten years ago on Monday, it was announced that the Games of the XXX Olympiad would be in London. Tony Blair told the International Olympic Committee that London had the power to motivate \u201cmillions more young people in Britain and across the world\u201d. Planning documents pledged that the great legacy of the Games would be to lever a nation of sport lovers away from their couches. The population would be fitter, healthier and produce more winners. It has not happened. The number of adults doing weekly sport did rise, by nearly 2 million in the runup to 2012 \u2013 but the general population was growing faster. Worse, the numbers are now falling at an accelerating rate. The opposition claims primary school pupils doing at least two hours of sport a week have nearly halved. Obesity has risen among adults and children. Official postmortems continue as to why London 2012 failed to \u201cinspire a generation\u201d. The success of Parkrun offers answers.\n\nLost generation of children deprived of school sports | Letters Read more\n\nParkrun is not a race but a time trial: your only competitor is the clock. The ethos welcomes anybody. There is as much joy over a puffed-out first-timer being clapped over the line as there is about top talent shining. The Olympic bidders, by contrast, wanted to get more people doing sport and to produce more elite athletes. The dual aim was muddled: the stress on success over taking part was intimidating for newbies. Parkrun started with a 5km loop of a park and a watch. The Olympic plans were replete with platitudes, a few tens of millions in funding, at least 88 regional and national coordinators, reps and partnerships, and jargon promising \u201cmore accountability for delivery of key targets\u201d, improvement \u201cmechanisms\u201d and support \u201cbased on best practice\u201d. All this was well-intentioned, and some money and initiatives meant that some sports clubs did get useful ideas and resources. But bound tomes and management tiers devised by civil servants have sucked the life out of the aim: galvanising individuals to challenge themselves, get fitter and healthier, and feel better about themselves.\n\nIndeed, there is something a little absurd in the state getting involved in the planning of such a fundamentally \u201cgrassroots\u201d concept as community sports associations. If there is a role for government, it should really be getting involved in providing common goods \u2013 making sure there is space for playing fields and the money to pave tennis and netball courts, and encouraging the provision of all these activities in schools. But successive governments have presided over selling green spaces, squeezing money from local authorities and declining attention on sport in education. Instead of wordy, worthy strategies, future governments need to do more to provide the conditions for sport to thrive. Or at least not make them worse. Then Parkrunners and anybody inspired to cycle to work, try tennis or form a neighbourhood football club can simply get on with doing it.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436109753471/London-2012-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4b48f3921231297e2e82552279ba136e", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+legacy%2CHealth%2CSchool+sports%2CRunning%2CLife+and+style%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CSchools%2CEducation%2CSociety%2CHealth+policy%2CPublic+services+policy%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CObesity", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436109753471/London-2012-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c68a140371141402c988fc35654c408f"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436109753471/London-2012-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4b48f3921231297e2e82552279ba136e", "date": "05/07/2015"}, "rank_27": {"title": "Olympic legacy failure: sporting numbers plummet amid confusion and blame", "text": "Only three of the 26 Olympic sports have seen significant increases in participation since London 2012 as the lack of a cohesive strategy and failures of some governing bodies mean much of the \u00a31bn in funding has gone to waste\n\nAmid the blizzard of breezy rhetoric and statistical information on Sport England\u2019s website detailing how the \u00a3325m of taxpayer and lottery funding it pours annually into grassroots sport is spent, one spreadsheet is particularly arresting.\n\nIt shows that in return for almost \u00a31bn given to 46 national sports governing bodies since 2009, just five \u2013 athletics, boxing, cycling, mountaineering and table tennis \u2013 have managed to achieve a statistically significant increase in the number of people playing every month since the bid was won. Just three of the 26 Olympic sports \u2013 athletics, cycling and gymnastics \u2013 have seen statistically significant increases in participation since 2012-13, with 15 other sports recording a fall. And since the Olympics, once-a-month participation figures show nearly 700,000 fewer adults are playing nationally funded sports. Since 2010, over 1.5m more people are not taking part in any sport. And that against the backdrop of a growing population base.\n\nOlympic legacy failure: inspiring London 2012 message has become a millstone Read more\n\nA new survey of more than 100 senior sports executives also revealed that 86% want a 10-year cross-party sport strategy and that only three in 10 rate the government\u2019s current strategy as \u201cgood\u201d. The Sports Think Tank survey also revealed a strong preference for \u201cfresh thinking and independent input\u201d into the government\u2019s looming green paper process. Strikingly, less than 10% thought the government\u2019s primary school sports premium, the \u00a3150m scheme that was the eventual replacement for the schools sport partnerships axed by Michael Gove, was effective. On the face of it, these results appears to be a damning indictment on a great funding experiment gone wrong.\n\nAmid a large-scale lobbying effort by the sports governing bodies in the wake of London winning the right to host the Games, the Labour government agreed to give them a guaranteed sum over four years in return for meeting various participation targets. The whole sport plan, as it was termed, would inject millions into 46 different governing bodies \u2013 from \u00a329.4m for rugby league to \u00a3756,750 for lawn bowls \u2013 over four years. A total of \u00a3480m was guaranteed from 2009 to 2013 and a further \u00a3493m from 2013 to 2017. Ever since, a succession of sports ministers have promised to get tough on governing bodies that are not delivering.\n\nThe Sport England chief executive, Jennie Price, has somehow escaped criticism, offloading responsibility on to those governing bodies and occasionally punishing them by taking a small slice of their award away. Yet as Sport England also points out, only 40% of its annual investment (split 75/25 between lottery funding and exchequer award) goes into whole sport plan funding.\n\nTracey Crouch, the new sports minister drawing up plans for a green paper, has hinted there will be an entirely fresh approach. Among the governing bodies there are fears that the baby could be thrown out with the bathwater. There is also long-standing frustration that their efforts are being measured by a blunt instrument \u2013 the expensive Active People telephone survey that until recently tracked participation among those older than 16.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing slow growth in the adult part of the game, but we have seen in the last four years since 2012 a humongous growth in young people,\u201d says Sally Munday, the chief executive of England Hockey. \u201cWe understand that the legacy seems to be judged by the Active People survey but it\u2019s shortsighted to judge it like that. You can\u2019t take governing bodies out of the picture, because if you do the system will crumble.\u201d\n\nMunday helped form the snappily titled NGB CEO forum, made up of 39 sports, to highlight the role they play. In a common refrain, they called shortly before the election for an \u201coverall vision created for sport across the country that aligns all stakeholders in central and local government with NGBs and others in the sporting landscape\u201d.\n\nThere are various mitigating factors that have made driving any lasting increase in participation difficult. Team sports face particular challenges with facilities and fitting into hectic modern lifestyles and working patterns. Swimming, which has registered the biggest decline, is disproportionately affected by local authority funding cuts.\n\nYet the governing bodies themselves, who solemnly signed up to drive participation upwards, must also take their share of the blame. \u201cIt was clear by 2010 that they weren\u2019t driving participation,\u201d admits the former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell, on whose watch the whole sport plan was introduced. There is a growing sentiment that public investment must reach beyond traditional governing bodies. Sport England has been praised for its This Girl Can consumer campaign to try to change the image of women\u2019s exercise. It is telling that it is cycling and athletics, where there are fewer concerns about facilities and it is easier to be flexible, that are among the few success stories.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s highlight where sports are trying to do innovative things and do a few simple things well,\u201d says Emma Boggis, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance and former head of the Olympic legacy unit in the cabinet office. \u201cThere is a danger in thinking it\u2019s all bad news and that you lose the good bits that are happening.\u201d\n\nParkrun, a national network of casual 5km mass running events administered by volunteers, has grown from 13 people in 2004 in Bushy Park, south-west London, to 74,000 a week across 390 events. \u201cThe majority of our volunteers have no previous experience in delivering sporting events,\u201d says Tom Williams, managing director of Parkrun UK, of its informal appeal and welcoming atmosphere. \u201cThey are people who think it\u2019s a great community initiative.\u201d\n\nExpanding the amount of public funding available to organisations such as Parkrun, which already receives some cash from Sport England, could be part of the answer. But so too could more governing bodies putting participation at the heart of their organisation \u2013 a cultural shift that for many simply hasn\u2019t happened. \u201cThis had to be more than just winning medals,\u201d says Ian Drake, the British Cycling chief executive who has helped marry elite success with participation growth of 23% since 2006. More than 2.1m people now cycle at least once a week for sport or pleasure.\n\nDrake, too, calls for more co-ordination from government. \u201cIt is something the system needs \u2013 something that brings together all the different elements. It needs the glue,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s almost a one size fits all model and everyone is measured against it.\u201d\n\nPrice has said that governing bodies must become better at focusing on how they fit into the lives of individuals rather than the other way around.\n\nWilliams, his glass half full, believes there is a future beyond the existing funding model \u2013 one that is expected to come under further pressure from cuts in the coming months. \u201cI think we\u2019re going through a transitional phase where organisations who are willing to collaborate and work together are going to succeed,\u201d he insists.\n\nOlympic legacy failure: Tessa Jowell attacks \u2018wicked\u2019 coalition government Read more\n\nDefiantly upbeat governing bodies have felled forests in producing brochures to prove their grassroots schemes are working. Yet the numbers tell a different story. Swimming, the biggest participation sport in the country, has lost 1.4m monthly participants since 2006.\n\nFootball, currently in the throes of one of its periodic bouts of internal wrangling about how the desperate deficit in grassroots coaching and facilities should be addressed, has gone from 2.9m to 2.66m.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to crack the nut of football and getting more money out of the richest sport in the world into grassroots football,\u201d says Chris Bryant, the recently appointed shadow culture secretary. Tennis is only now making some of the right noises about investing its huge Wimbledon endowment in the right areas.\n\nYou can go down the list of sports and tick off those that appear genuinely engaged in trying to turn the tide, those who pay lip service and those who simply are not up to the job.

He is warning that cuts on this scale to his and other cities \u2013 the Local Government Association expects George Osborne\u2019s budget on Wednesday to impose a further \u00a33.3bn cut \u2013 is making it difficult for local authorities to fulfil their most basic legal responsibilities: looking after vulnerable children and pensioners. Parks, playing fields, swimming pools, leisure centres, the non-statutory, civic, health and quality of life provision which councils originally took over from a patchwork of philanthropic monuments, have been inescapably cut during the five years straddling the Olympics, for which \u00a39.3bn of public money was found.\n\nNewcastle\u2019s council says it must drain a further \u00a32m from its sport and leisure budget over the next three years and, having closed the pool and transferred two others and two leisure centres to trusts, it is looking to offload all its remaining leisure centres.\n\nNationally, the new sports minister, Tracey Crouch, reacted to the recent drop in numbers of people participating in sport once a week, down to 35.5% of adults, including the startling 729,000 fall in people swimming over the past decade, by directing blame on to the quango Sport England and the sports governing bodies whose programmes it funds.\n\nA government spokesman told the Guardian: \u201cWe are investing over \u00a31bn of public funding to strengthen community sport over five years. But the sports minister has been clear that too many sports bodies are currently not delivering in bringing new people from all backgrounds to their sport. This is why a new sports strategy is being worked on that will further build on the cross-government work on sport and physical activity that happens.\u201d\n\nHowever, that \u00a31bn \u201cpublic funding\u201d for community sport melds money from the national lottery, of which sport is one of the direct, statutory beneficiaries, with funding Crouch\u2019s government provides. Sport England says that its annual budget of \u00a3325m is comprised of \u00a3243m from the lottery \u2013 75% \u2013 with a mere \u00a382m coming from the government.\n\nThe LGA has calculated that from 2009-10 when the previous Labour government was investing in sport and leisure with \u00a31.4bn being spent by local authorities, the budget this year has been reduced to around \u00a31bn. That cut, \u00a3400m nationally per year, before the further cuts expected to be imposed this week, is almost five times more than the total money the government provides to Sport England.\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has analysed the sport and leisure budgets without libraries and other cultural services \u2013 which have also suffered huge, well\u2011publicised cuts \u2013 and calculates the budget purely for sport has fallen \u00a3215m a year, from \u00a3832m in 2009-10 to \u00a3617m nationally this year, a cut of around 25%. A survey by the Chief Cultural & Leisure Officers Association has estimated that since the cuts began to bite, 6,000 sport and leisure staff have gone.\n\nMark Allman, the CLOA chair, is head of sport and active lifestyles in Leeds, which has closed two swimming pools and reduced opening times at all its sports centres. He describes the three years since 2012 as \u201ca missed opportunity to build a proper plan into the Olympics\u201d but, like many within local authorities, points to the efforts being made to maintain facilities and programmes.\n\nLeeds has managed to build two new sports centres: the John Charles and Holt Park, the latter combined with health and social care facilities which many see as a model for the future. Allman says that bigger cities have had the capacity to consolidate their facilities \u2013 Manchester has closed five older leisure centres recently but built three new ones \u2013 while smaller district councils lack alternative options and are struggling nationwide to keep facilities open.\n\nLisa Mulherin, Leeds city council\u2019s executive member for health, wellbeing and adults, bemoans a \u00a36m cut in the sport and leisure budget compared with 2010-11, part of a \u00a3178m, 40%, overall cut from the council\u2019s 2010-11 total budget of \u00a3446m.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to close facilities; if we had the funding we would never have closed those pools and we would be investing more in sport and activity,\u201d Mulherin says. \u201cThis government is saying it wants to encourage sport, particularly in deprived communities \u2013 but it is doing the polar opposite.\u201d\n\nOlympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery Read more\n\nBirmingham city council has transferred several sports centres to trusts, while seeing significant increases in participation at those it retained by making entry free, due to a partnership with local health authorities. Paulette Hamilton, cabinet member for health and social care, hailed that as a \u201creal success\u201d \u2013 the kind of \u201cjoined-up thinking\u201d Crouch has said she will try to engender, yet points to \u201csavage cuts\u201d \u2013 \u00a3462m from Birmingham\u2019s budget since 2010-11 \u2013 which she blames for the overall national fall in participation. Her council has increased hiring fees for its football pitches by 91% since then, which Kenny Saunders, of the Save Grass Roots Football campaign, says is being replicated across the country and driving senior and junior clubs away.\n\nIn government responses from three departments: culture, media and sport, health, and communities and local government, there was not a single acknowledgement that the massive cuts to sporting provision during this time of promised Olympic legacy are having any impact at all. The DCMS said: \u201cWe work closely with local government to ensure they continue to provide the best services that local people want to see.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health, which many believe should take overall responsibility for community sport as part of a joined-up battle against modern sedentary lifestyles, says obesity now costs the NHS \u00a35bn annually. Yet initiatives pointed to by the DH comprised \u00a3600m being spent by another department, education, on school sport and the health campaign Change4Life. That, too, has had its funding cut, by more than 50%, from \u00a323.45m in 2009-10, to \u00a310m this year.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the \u00a39.3bn Olympics broadcast to the world modern Britain\u2019s NHS and social advances, even while the legacy of sports facilities built over more than a century was being relentlessly undermined, under assault by a thousand cuts.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/David-Conn,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b938091e640223126af0fe98e538ca2f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436115066638/Hastings-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f540beadd4430bf4e27f3ddfd9e69dcf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436115066638/Hastings-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e81be2df3cf6f58e59514b3896719d4", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CSport", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436115066638/Hastings-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e81be2df3cf6f58e59514b3896719d4", "date": "05/07/2015"}, "rank_43": {"title": "What's happened to 'affordable' housing on London's Olympic park?", "text": "Ten years on from the 2012 bid win in Singapore, London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and its environs are filling up, opening out, coming to life. Snort all you like about the costs and controversies, this is no Athens tumbleweed repeat. The aquatics centre, Velopark and Copper Box sports venues are open to the public, as is the Arcelormittal Orbit in all its looming gormlessness. A hockey and tennis centre is doing business and the main stadium will host its latest post-Games big time athletics meeting later this month. Next August, it will become the new home ground of West Ham.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the erstwhile media centre buildings are gathering tenants and last Tuesday a ceremonial shovel was plunged into the ground where a new Transport for London HQ will be built. Given the ongoing rumblings about how money has been spent on this monster regeneration scheme since back in 2004, some may be bleakly amused that the Financial Conduct Authority will be TfL\u2019s neighbour in developer Lend Lease\u2019s International Quarter project next to the Westfield shopping mall. Even so, the park and its fringes are starting to shape up as \u201ca place\u201d as opposed to a wasteland with a running track. Which brings us to a row about housing.\n\nLast Thursday I chaired a housing policy hustings for the six people hoping to become Labour\u2019s 2016 mayoral candidate. At one point, Diane Abbott renewed a criticism of Tessa Jowell over the percentage of Olympic Park homes going under that slippery portmanteau \u201caffordable\u201d. Abbott\u2019s case, simply put, is that this percentage isn\u2019t high enough and that Jowell, a former Olympics minister, is to blame. Jowell\u2019s defence, which did not come across very clearly in part due to a catcall chorus from the audience, is that the housing on the park for which she was responsible scores pretty well on the \u201caffordable\u201d scale, whereas what\u2019s followed, for which she\u2019s not been responsible, has scored poorly by comparison.\n\nJowell is basically right. Under present plans there will eventually be six residential areas within the park, but she presided over the deal for only the first of these, the conversion of the Olympic Village, where athletes bedded down during the Games, into long term residential dwellings. Now renamed East Village, it contains 2,818 units of which roughly half are market priced homes (mostly for private rent), a quarter are housing association homes of the intermediate variety of \u201caffordable\u201d - which means shared-ownership or \u201cintermediate rent\u201d properties for middle-income households - and a quarter are for social rent.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a 50/50 \u201caffordable\u201d/market split, with half the \u201caffordable\u201d allocated to people on low incomes. To some, that might not sound great - after all, the market priced accommodation isn\u2019t cheap. But it looks pretty good next to the average \u201caffordable\u201d yield from private developments across London in recent years of 34%, with social housing often absent altogether. Indeed 50% \u201caffordable\u201d of any kind is just about unheard of in the capital these days and the deal on the Village was struck in the depths of the recession. It was also an increase on the 35% proposed in the original Olympic Park spec.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened to \u201caffordable\u201d housing since the development of all aspects of the park passed into the control of London Mayor Boris Johnson in 2009, first through the Olympic Park Legacy Company and then the more powerful London Legacy Development Corporation (formed in spring 2012), does indeed look weak next to the East Village figures, as Jowell was keen to point out at the hustings. However, there\u2019s always more to these stories than meets the eye.\n\n\n\nThe first of the planned five park neighbourhoods to be constructed from scratch will be the 850-unit Chobham Manor, whose market homes went on sale \u201coff plan\u201d a year ago. This will have only 29% \u201caffordable\u201d homes, split broadly three ways between social rent, the more expensive (and contentiously-named) \u201caffordable rent\u201d and shared ownership. The next two neighbourhoods in the pipeline will be East Wick (up to 870 homes) and Sweetwater (up to 650 homes) on the west side of the park. With these, the \u201caffordable\u201d proportion negotiated is 31% including some social rented properties.\n\n\n\nWhy so low? The reason is that there have been trade-offs to get things moving more quickly. East Wick and Sweetwater are now scheduled for completion by 2023, which is about five years sooner than previously envisaged. Essentially, the developers are to build more homes on the site for market sale and private rent in return for building out the site more speedily, it being in their interest to take their time about these things when house prices are going up and up.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m assured from the development corporation side of the fence that the reductions in \u201caffordable\u201d have been very small and that this drawback is outweighed by the quickened pace of delivery. \u201cIt\u2019s a pragmatic approach,\u201d is the candid summary. And there\u2019s another factor in the whole, big, brain-hurting equation. Tessa Jowell\u2019s Olympic Village deal was done under the last Labour government, before public investment in affordable homes was slashed by the coalition. Having a lot less money never helps.\n\n", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436365505545/ced085b7-0017-49bc-a29d-ed14b3f18a6f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6258dbad33f302d1b77848b84f390ace", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=UK+news%2CSociety%2CHousing%2CCommunities%2CSocial+housing%2COlympic+legacy%2CBoris+Johnson%2CPolitics%2CMayoral+elections%2CLocal+government%2CLocal+politics%2CLondon+politics%2CTessa+Jowell%2CDiane+Abbott%2CLondon", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436365505545/ced085b7-0017-49bc-a29d-ed14b3f18a6f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e6f6592c0eb288965e71ee9a8cc38194"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436365505545/ced085b7-0017-49bc-a29d-ed14b3f18a6f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6258dbad33f302d1b77848b84f390ace", "date": "08/07/2015"}, "rank_2": {"title": "London's Olympic legacy three years on: is the city really getting what it needed?", "text": "London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is shaping up and once again inviting the multitudes in - but is it helping to provide the kind of legacy the people of east London were promised?\n\nSome of the starkest images from the financial fall of Greece have been of its 2004 Olympic Games buildings: abandoned stadiums and peeling paint telling tales of broken promises and soured dreams. Whatever else might be said about London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park three years after the 2012 Olympics, it is no tumbleweed vista. The broader issue, though, is whether it is helping to provide the kind of legacy the people of east London were promised.\n\nCertainly the Olympic Park itself \u2013 all 560 acres of it \u2013 is shaping up, filling out and once again inviting the multitudes in. The London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) \u2013 formed shortly before the Games as the planning authority for the park and its environs \u2013 claims that, since it started to reopen two years ago, the park has had more than 4m visits. Neale Coleman, LLDC board chairman and Olympics adviser to London mayor Boris Johnson, says that these include \u201cloads and loads of local people. It really is used by the community and it\u2019s going to be even better for them in the future.\u201d\n\nThe permanent sports venues have led the way. Last March, Zaha Hadid\u2019s curvaceous aquatics centre, whose soaring construction costs caused much disquiet when it was being built, became a public facility, with entrance prices pegged to local levels. During the same month, the equally striking velodrome \u2013 scene of some of Britain\u2019s most memorable medal wins \u2013 formally became part of the larger Lee Valley VeloPark, catering for cyclists of all types and abilities.\n\nCompare us with Sydney or Barcelona or Beijing \u2026 They\u2019ve all struggled, but we\u2019re on course to do what we said we would Neale Coleman\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The soaring construction costs of Zaha Hadid\u2019s aquatics centre caused much disquiet when it was being built. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian\n\nThe multi-purpose Copper Box Arena, which hosted handball and other events, had already reopened and is now used by the public and local clubs for an array of indoor sports. Close to it, the former media complex \u2013 which for the three weeks of the Games was crammed with journalists and broadcast units \u2013 has been renamed as Here East and is to be developed into the digital and creative industry hub always envisaged.\n\nThere had been dismay in 2011 when the BBC decided against relocating the EastEnders production operation to Here East from Elstree, and Boris Johnson later came under pressure from within his own ranks to level the site for housing. But BT Sport has become the longed-for glamorous anchor tenant, Loughborough University will set up a postgraduate research centre there, and Hackney Community College will move in to supply apprentices. Commercial tenants are confidently predicted to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, the main Olympic stadium has hosted further leading athletics competitions, with the third-anniversary Games starting tomorrow and featuring 2012 stars Usain Bolt and Mo Farah. The original structure is undergoing a major reconstruction so that it can also become the new home of West Ham United from next August. The conversion costs involved have stirred controversy \u2013 \u00a3272m, of which the football club will pay just \u00a315m plus annual rent of \u00a32.5m, bringing the final price tag to \u00a3702m. But with Rugby World Cup fixtures, community sports days and cultural events to be held there along with Hammers matches, the 54,000-seat bowl seems unlikely to gather dust.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Not enough people want to go up Anish Kapoor\u2019s ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture. Photograph: Paul Thomas/Getty Images\n\nThe one fixed feature underperforming so far at the Olympic Park is the ArcelorMittal Orbit, Anish Kapoor\u2019s giant coiling red sculpture: not enough people want to go up it. There are plans to lower the entrance fee and attach a giant slide to the side of it.\n\nDepending on your point of view, all this represents grotesque overindulgence or a commendable exception to the usual Olympics rule, which holds that the showcase infrastructure falls into varying degrees of disuse and grand \u201clegacy\u201d pledges go unfulfilled. For Coleman, the positive interpretation clearly applies. \u201cNever mind Athens, compare us with Sydney or Barcelona or Beijing as well. They\u2019ve all struggled, but we\u2019re on course to do what we said we would, and not just with the park and the venues.\u201d\n\nBefore Johnson became mayor, Coleman worked for his predecessor Ken Livingstone and was involved with the Games bid from its conception in 2003. Livingstone and fellow Labour politicians who argued the case for a London Olympics \u2013 primarily the then-culture secretary Tessa Jowell, eventually supported by then-prime minister Tony Blair \u2013 argued that an Olympics set in the part of the capital that had historically been its poorest would sharply accelerate an economic rebirth that was desperately required by Londoners who had yet to enjoy much obvious benefit from their city\u2019s renewed prosperity since the 1980s.\n\nLivingstone was famously candid. Uninterested in sport and never a big fan of Blair, he characterised the bid as \u201cthe only way to get billions of pounds out of the government to develop the East End\u201d. In 2007, when it was announced that the overall Olympic budget had trebled to \u00a39.3bn, he was moved to reassert that the levy he had been raising on London\u2019s council tax-payers to help pay the growing bill represented good value for money \u2013 the 38p \u201cbargain\u201d price of a Walnut Whip a week, as he put it, for a Band D household.\n\n[The Olympics bid was] the only way to get billions of pounds out of the government to develop the East End Ken Livingstone\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Olympic Stadium is undergoing a major reconstruction so that it can become the new home of West Ham United from next August. Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer\n\nThe pros and cons of sinking such substantial public funds into one of Europe\u2019s largest regeneration projects can be weighed in many ways but, for Ian Crockford of property developer Lend Lease, it has achieved the legacy goal of drawing investment eastwards. He was project manager of the stadium under the Olympic Delivery Authority, the now defunct body that assembled and cleared the park land and was responsible for the construction of its venues, facilities and infrastructure. Now he is in charge of the creation of a four-million sq ft office area, the International Quarter, beside the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre on the park\u2019s south-eastern fringe.\n\n\u201cThe location is its winning point,\u201d Crockford enthuses, listing its strengths: open space, sports facilities, transport links to central London, lots of restaurants and many shops. The mix of park ingredients has shifted over time, with fewer homes than originally planned for its future five new residential neihgbourhoods but with the addition of a culture and education centre, Olympicopolis. This is expected to begin opening from 2019, and will contain new spaces for the V&A museum, Sadler\u2019s Wells, University of the Arts London and discussions are under way to add the first UK branch of the Smithsonian Institution. There will be a new University College London campus, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous mix of uses,\u201d Crockford says. \u201cThink of the synergy we\u2019re going to have with the surroundings. This is why tenants want to come here. It\u2019s so different to other areas of London.\u201d\n\nIn the past, politicians had fretted about the park\u2019s setting. It was one thing to point out that the capital\u2019s centre of gravity was moving east \u2013 a shift that had been very visible since the rise of Canary Wharf \u2013 but another to make the case that this whole new piece of London landscape, half the size of a borough on an unfashionable transition zone between inner and outer London, could be a thriving new business frontier.\n\nThe International Quarter looks set to demonstrate that it can. It will become the new home of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and of Transport for London. Given the history of cost concerns about the Games, some may wryly consider the FCA\u2019s appearance on the scene long overdue. But having hefty public sector players on board gives solidity to claims that the development will become London\u2019s fourth office quarter, adding to the big three of the City, the West End and Canary Wharf.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Depending on your point of view, the Olympic legacy represents grotesque overindulgence or a commendable exception. Photograph: Jason Hawkes/Getty Images\n\nBut, as always with major regeneration schemes, questions are raised about who really gains. Making an area more attractive tends to have the advertised effect, drawing new people to it with a variety of outcomes. Before it knows it, a down-at-heel neighbourhood is deemed up-and-coming, property prices and rents rise accordingly and the mixed blessings of gentrification follow.\n\nOpposite flanks of the park illustrate well this fluid blend of continuity and change. A southbound towpath walk along the River Lea Navigation Canal down the west side of the park takes you past Here East and then, further on, on the opposite bank, Hackney Wick\u2019s White Building, which is sold as \u201cLondon\u2019s centre for art, technology and sustainability\u201d and \u201can incubator for discursive and innovative thought\u201d, no less. It\u2019s all craft beer, bicycles and beards.\n\nBy contrast, on the forecourt of the Westfield mall and the teeming bus and rail transport hub, a strong flavour of pre-Olympic Stratford survives: homelessness campaigners, vendors of The Watchtower, a bow-tied citizen of the Nation of Islam. Cross the road and the old indoor shopping centre seems still very much alive, with its market stalls and Shoe Zone and second-hand jewellery. Emerge on to the Broadway on the other side and there\u2019s the Old Town Hall, where Newham\u2019s executive mayor Sir Robin Wales says: \u201cThe government has walked away from legacy. We\u2019ve been given some of the biggest cuts in the country, as have Tower Hamlets and Hackney. So that\u2019s masses of money taken out of the East End.\u201d\n\nNewham encompasses a territory bordered by the Thames to the south that\u2019s seen its past fortunes ebb and flow with those of London\u2019s docks, and it endured devastation during the war. Its growing population of over 300,000 is one of Britain\u2019s youngest and poorest. Unemployment rates are high, as are those for ill health and premature death. Resentment of \u201crich London\u201d gets a reality check here.\n\nThe government has walked away from legacy. We\u2019ve been given some of the biggest cuts in the country \u2026 Sir Robin Wales\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Making an area more attractive means property prices and rents rise accordingly and the mixed blessings of gentrification follow. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian\n\nAlong with its fellow \u201cgrowth boroughs\u201d Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Greenwich, Waltham Forest and Barking and Dagenham (formerly called the \u201cOlympic boroughs\u201d), Newham is pursuing the 20-year goal of \u201cconvergence\u201d with the rest of London in terms of social mix and life chances. According to the latest figures, the six as a whole are on course as measured by 12 out of 21 indicators, but are falling short on nine.\n\nThe data does not disclose if the positive changes show things are improving for longstanding residents or a reflection of more affluent people moving in. Wales makes no bones about desiring a larger middle class \u2013 \u201cI want them in the schools saying, \u2018This isn\u2019t bloody good enough!\u2019\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s long been concerned about losing the home-grown variety through population churn, with locals who get on in life then moving out. He is encouraged that Newham\u2019s local household panel survey suggests this is slowing down.\n\nWales subscribes to the concept of \u201cresilience\u201d and building it into Newham\u2019s economy, communities and individual residents, equipping them to cope with disadvantage and to better take advantage of new opportunities generated by legacy-fuelled change. Newham has programmes for improving English skills in a borough where over 200 languages and dialects are spoken. Its schoolchildren in years five, six and seven have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument free of charge, the borough believing this pays dividends in terms of wider intellectual development. Wales is immensely proud of Workplace, the borough\u2019s own job brokerage that pro-actively connects unemployed residents with local employers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got over 26,000 into work,\u201d he says, \u201cand 4,500 last year.\u201d\n\nLike many other London borough leaders, especially Labour ones, Wales is exploring new ways of getting homes built for Newham residents and protecting what he has. As the price of buying and private renting soars \u2013 house-price inflation in neighbourhoods such as Manor Park and Forest Gate has been among the highest in London \u2013 Newham is seeking to exploit the borough\u2019s own land assets commercially. A council-owned company called Red Door Ventures has begun building more than 3,000 homes for local people for private rental on council-owned land. Some of the rents will be subsidised, and will generate a long-term income stream for future reinvestment in sub-market-priced homes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The capital\u2019s centre of gravity is moving east and this whole new piece of London landscape has potential to be a thriving new business frontier. Photograph: Kevin Allen\n\nMeanwhile, Newham has been endeavouring to shift some of its stock into partnerships with housing associations to put it beyond the reach of Right to Buy, though if the new government implements its policy of extending the right to housing association tenants \u2013 a policy even a senior representative of London big business has described as \u201cbonkers\u201d \u2013 it might prove futile.\n\nHousing policy in Newham has attracted some uncomfortable media coverage, including over the plans to redevelop the 23-acre Carpenters estate, which stands right next to the Olympic Park. Since 2007, the borough has been moving residents out, triggering opposition from some leaseholders and tenants and enabling a recent, highly publicised, occupation by a group of single mothers who moved into four boarded up Carpenters flats after the council and their housing-association landlord decided they were ready to move from the Focus E15 Foyer hostel. Wales has expressed some regrets over that episode, but remains adamant that the Carpenters land can and will be put to better use.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to build thousands more homes there and we\u2019re going to get jobs there. If you want us to build more homes that people can afford, we\u2019re going to have to move some people from our brownfield sites for the greater good.\u201d\n\nDefining what that means and how best to pursue it in the paradoxical London context of booming growth and grinding austerity is as much a part of the Olympic legacy as the Olympic Park itself.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "images": ["https://static.theguardian.com/commercial/sponsor/cities/cities/logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Cities%2CLondon%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Stadium%2CHousing%2CGentrification%2CRegeneration%2CPublic+finance%2COlympic+Games+2012%2CCommunities%2COlympic+Games%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CSport", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437569029337/6f27dfc0-dfe4-488a-99a3-32478f07482a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71416bf73706beae30881905e013c039", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01f75ae05522f9bee612b185595bae364dcc71ea/0_0_5566_3340/master/5566.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=415106cbce1763ad78a6db05b55c59ee", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9359d613f93af26e0c35404d44339aa2025a985a/0_0_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=115c675fa825f419e1b29803800618e1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437562244231/fe926b90-ab72-4c79-abba-a4f1158e2603-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6190a1923c16b8a7c3cc9aff4ce49fa5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f16bc492e753342bbf84e523fb2f75b3047e47b/0_0_5311_3187/master/5311.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=234b5f3cbdb03cd3d6bc8482494a959e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437564223357/5d4d43e0-792e-4a6b-96d5-8d752c86ddcf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9e0c95986156a12b5ea5dd451676c64", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437569177351/b685e8ce-52e0-44cb-94be-160f1392cf25-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=453e5cfa63aed3edd36eccf7c2bcff02", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437571745865/90079412-b179-4330-9ad2-225e49e28384-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=218b405297c13daec7c1411bfcf328d1"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/22/1437569177351/b685e8ce-52e0-44cb-94be-160f1392cf25-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=453e5cfa63aed3edd36eccf7c2bcff02", "date": "23/07/2015"}, "rank_142": {"title": "Sports minister sets goals for a fitter nation after Olympic legacy stagnates", "text": "The sports minister, Tracey Crouch, has vowed a new government strategy for sport, the first for two decades, will boost \u201cstagnant\u201d participation figures in response to criticism of the faltering Olympic legacy. But national governing bodies, who share \u00a3493m over four years, fear an increased focus on physical activity rather than traditional sport will lead to funding cuts.\n\nAs part of the review, Crouch said the Premier League had promised to double the amount it invests in grassroots football each year to more than \u00a3100m after calls for it to do more to support the wider game in light of the \u00a38.5bn TV deal.\n\nOlympic legacy failure: inspiring London 2012 message has become a millstone Read more\n\nThe government has also ruled out tinkering with the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d, the list of protected events for free-to-air television, postponed any decision on introducing safe standing in football grounds and ordered all governing bodies to meet minimum governance standards by 2017.\n\nThe new strategy charges Sport England, the quango that invests \u00a3325m a year in grassroots sport, with overseeing children from the age of five rather than the current 14 and focusing more on getting inactive people to exercise rather than those who already play sport.\n\n\u201cThis is about national governing bodies and other organisations being on an equal footing. NGBs are at the coalface but there is a recognition there are certain communities they find it hard to access,\u201d said Crouch, who in June said the strategy was severely outdated.\n\n\u201cIf the NGBs turn around and adapt accordingly they have nothing to fear. Traditional governing bodies have many challenges. I think good national governing bodies can be flexible in the way they deliver their sport. They have to have an understanding of the social good that sport can do in wider society.\u201d\n\nFunding will be targeted at specific groups with lower than average participation rates including women, people with disabilities, those in lower socioeconomic groups and older people.\n\nGoverning bodies and other organisations such as StreetGames will be assessed on how well they can perform in relation to five key outcomes \u2013 physical health, mental health, individual development, social and community development and economic development \u2013 rather than simply increasing participation figures.\n\n\u201cAnother important shift in this strategy is the move beyond participation in sport and winning medals as the only outputs we want to encourage,\u201d the strategy said. \u201cBoth are clearly very important and are retained in our new strategy but sport has other ways of delivering the overall outcomes.\u201d\n\nThe previous strategy, through \u00a33bn invested since the London Olympics were won in 2005, achieved an increase in the number of people playing sport once a week but the numbers have stagnated since the 2012 Games. \u201cThe strategy had run its course. It was designed around the Olympics and increasing the participation rates and delivering medal success. We all know that since the Olympics participation rates have stagnated,\u201d Crouch said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to look again at how we deliver sports and physical activity and how we measure it.\u201d\n\nTo make matters worse, the number of people in lower socioeconomic groups playing sport decreased and the number of inactive people doing no exercise at all increased.\n\nSport England, which will continue to be the organisation through which the funds from the national lottery and the exchequer are poured despite being criticised for the malaise, will now come up with its own strategy to be published in the new year.\n\nThe oft-criticised Active People survey will be replaced with a new measurement tool called Active Lives that will also measure other forms of activity such as cycling to work, dance and rambling as well as activity among children from the age of five for the first time.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we have a proper, accurate measurement of what we\u2019re doing across the nation. It\u2019s incredibly frustrating to be told there is no legacy from the Olympics when every weekend you go out into the local community and see thousands of kids participating,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cIt\u2019s all happening, it\u2019s just not being measured. We want to see this properly measured. If kids start participating in sport in a much earlier age, they will develop that habit for life.\u201d\n\nBut there are fears major cuts to local authority budgets will undermine any progress that could be made by Sport England. \u201cGood local authorities recognise the value of investing in sport and physical activity because it reduces the burden on other areas,\u201d Crouch said.\n\nCrouch also said other departments such as health, education and transport were collaborating more closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport than had been the case. The Premier League has promised to invest in grassroots projects, including a scheme to provide coaches to primary schools, from 2016-17 but said the details were contingent on the outcome of an Ofcom investigation into how broadcasting rights are sold.\n\nCrouch, who promised to act after calls for the Premier League to do more, insisted it had not got off lightly: \u201cThrough some tough negotiations but constructive conversations, they will at least double their investment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be going into football in this country. That\u2019s real progress.

But earlier this week a tribunal ruled that it must publish. The contract reveals that the LLDC will keep the first \u00a34m of any naming rights deal for the stadium over a 20-year period and that anything over that will be split 50-50.\n\nThe LLDC will also keep the first \u00a3500,000 of any profit on catering, with anything over that amount being split 70/30.\n\nIt also confirms that the LLDC will meet all the running costs for the stadium, providing everything from stewards to corner flags, and that West Ham must pay an additional \u00a3100,000 for each match they play over an agreed total of 25 per season.\n\nWest Ham must also pay up to \u00a3100,000 per season extra if they finish in the top half of the Premier League and various bonuses if they win domestic cups or qualify for Europe, up to \u00a31m in the unlikely event they win the Champions League.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed by the tribunal\u2019s decision. Our motivation in bringing this case has been to protect millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money. The stadium needs to be a profitable and successful commercial operation otherwise it will rely on public subsidy,\u201d said an LLDC spokesman of the decision to publish the contract in the wake of the tribunal ruling.\n\n\u201cWe were concerned that the publication of this contract and the precedent it may set for future agreements could make it harder to do this. However, we have decided not to seek leave to appeal, and have today made the contract available on our website.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the coalition of clubs said: \u201cThe hard work now begins to understand the deal, its costs to the taxpayer, and to football, and any further implications. This is a victory for the power of football supporters: organised, focused and willing to work together to achieve a collective goal.\u201d\n\nThe agreement outlines the extent to which West Ham take primacy during the football season, underlining the need for it to retain the \u201clook and feel\u201d of its home ground.\n\nThe venue is also to host the 2017 IAAF and IPC Athletics World Championships and there is a 50-year agreement for British Athletics to use the venue each July. Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said last week that West Ham\u2019s deal to move into the stadium was akin to \u201cwinning the lottery\u201d.\n\nWest Ham said in a statement: \u201cAs the commissioner identifies, the factor which sets the agreement with West Ham apart from that of any other stadium user is our commitment to a 99-year commercial lease, which ultimately secured the stadium\u2019s future and the success it is now guaranteed to enjoy. It will be sold out for every West Ham home game from next season onwards, meaning our presence will bring hundreds of millions of additional people and billions of pounds of extra revenue over the course of the tenancy.\n\n\u201cBut while someone renting the Stadium for 25 days a year cannot be responsible for 365 days\u2019 running costs, going by our performances this season, we hope to deliver additional revenue to the stadium via extended cup runs and big European nights.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97f4ed5a05909058cc6fe6e5dc3eac5483eb40e7/0_143_4000_2400/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4476d4af4908623e035d453074e1a5a0", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=West+Ham+United%2COlympic+Stadium%2CFootball%2COlympic+legacy%2CSport%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97f4ed5a05909058cc6fe6e5dc3eac5483eb40e7/0_143_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1860952d63b4554c7cca27198fe8b17f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97f4ed5a05909058cc6fe6e5dc3eac5483eb40e7/0_143_4000_2400/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4476d4af4908623e035d453074e1a5a0", "date": "14/04/2016"}, "rank_130": {"title": "How West Ham struck the deal of the century with Olympic Stadium move", "text": "West Ham may have lost in the FA Cup on Wednesday but the club have scored a resounding victory off the field \u2013 and the awkward questions persist\n\nAs the sun went down on West Ham\u2019s hopes of ending their last season at the Boleyn Ground with a trophy on Wednesday, a rainbow appeared behind the East Stand, arching over the Chicken Run. And it couldn\u2019t help but appear to point to the pot of gold in Stratford that many have long suspected West Ham secured in their 99-year agreement to move into the Olympic Stadium from next season.\n\nThanks to the dogged determination of a Charlton Athletic fan, latterly backed by a coalition of 14 supporters\u2019 trusts from across the country, we now know on exactly what terms West Ham will lease the stadium.\n\nWhile it was easy to understand why one side argued for full transparency on the terms of the contract \u2013 the vast majority of the \u00a3701m spent on the stadium has come from the public purse \u2013 it was hard not to conclude that the reason for the London Legacy Development Corporation\u2019s reticence was not commercial, as it claimed, but old-fashioned embarrassment.\n\nWest Ham\u2019s Olympic Stadium contract: club to pay \u00a32.5m per season in rent Read more\n\nThose who have followed the twists and turns of this saga since it was decided at a fateful meeting of the Olympic board in 2007 to snub football and effectively park any decision on the future of the stadium until after the Games will be familiar with the bare bones of the deal.\n\nBut to see it written down in black and white confirms again what a leg-up West Ham\u2019s joint majority owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, and canny vice-chair Karren Brady (rumoured to have got a sizeable bonus for landing the deal) have received.\n\nThey argue, quite reasonably, that without them the stadium would be facing an uncertain future and ongoing subsidy. But they also know they have landed a stupendous deal.\n\nIn bald terms, LLDC will take on all of the running costs from the corner flags to the stewards in return for \u00a32.5m a year in rent (reduced by half in the event of relegation) and a one-off payment of \u00a315m.\n\nWest Ham keep all their ticket revenue while other income streams are shared. Over the first two decades of the stadium\u2019s life, the LLDC will pocket the first \u00a34m of any naming rights deal on the iconic stadium and share anything over that 50-50 with West Ham.\n\nIn the small print, it also emerges that West Ham will get a 40% reduction in their rental terms after 20 years if they choose to forego their share of naming rights revenue. Alternatively, they can stick with the existing agreement. As elsewhere, the dice seem loaded in West Ham\u2019s favour.\n\nThe Hammers will, of course, argue that their presence will vastly boost the price and therefore they deserve to share in the upside. Critics may say they\u2019re getting a pretty good deal already.\n\nThe same principle applies to catering revenue. The LLDC will keep the first \u00a3500,000 per year, but will share anything after that on a 70-30 split. West Ham will contribute to triggering that \u00a3500,000 level by paying the LLDC\u2019s contractor for hospitality catering.\n\nThe LLDC might consider itself quite pleased with performance-related bonuses that guarantee, for example, an extra \u00a3100,000 if West Ham finish 10th. If the club were to win the league, the bonus payments would tot up to just over \u00a31m. Or, to put it another way, around eight weeks\u2019 wages for Dimitri Payet. And given that the bottom club in the Premier League next season will receive at least \u00a3100m in TV money alone, it starts to look less of a bonus for the taxpayer.\n\nTaken as a whole, the 207-page document also underlines the extent to which the stadium is to all intents and purposes West Ham\u2019s for the duration of the football season. Up to now, it has suited both tenant and landlord to insist the contract is for just 25 days a year.\n\nThe LDDC promises in the section on naming rights that the stadium \u201cshall retain the look and feel of the home ground of West Ham United Football Club during the football season without limitation\u201d.\n\nUltimately, the details of the contract confirm everything we suspected.\n\nOne, that between them the various agencies responsible for the stadium made a complete Horlicks of planning for its post-Olympics future.\n\nTwo, that once the political decision had been taken to seek a Premier League football club as a tenant and, crucially, to keep the running track then the LLDC had little option but to go to West Ham and try to strike whatever deal it could.\n\nThree, that Gold, Sullivan and Brady have got themselves the deal of the century. It is difficult to disagree with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger when the Arsenal manager said inheriting the stadium was like \u201cwinning the lottery\u201d.\n\nWhen it opens at the beginning of the 2016-17 season, the new 60,000-capacity stadium will seem airy and impressive to some, insubstantial and windswept to others. It has been almost entirely rebuilt since the summer of 2012 to make it suitable for both athletics and football.\n\nThe skirmish over the release of the contract has become just one more postscript in the Great Olympic Stadium Mystery. All the main protagonists, from the London mayor Boris Johnson to West Ham to the LLDC to the Newham Mayor Sir Robin Wales, at various points said they were relaxed about publication. Yet still the LLDC resisted, racking up legal bills.\n\nMeanwhile the future intentions of Gold and Sullivan have come under scrutiny since they bought the club. Both insist they will not sell but the prospect that they might cash in on their good fortune prompted Johnson to belatedly agree a deal to claw back some money if they did.\n\nThe mechanics are outlined in an annex and will deliver a percentage of the purchase price over \u00a3125m to the LLDC provided the club is sold within the next 10 years.\n\nThe mechanism is complex but if the club were sold for \u00a3250m within the first five years of the move, the LLDC would receive \u00a312m. If the sale price were \u00a3300m, then \u00a327m would flow back to the taxpayer and if the sale price were \u00a3500m, the proceeds would jump to around \u00a387m. Between five and 10 years after the move, the sums decrease.\n\nThe publication of the document was a victory for transparency but is unlikely to be the end of the saga. The coalition of 14 supporters\u2019 clubs said they would begin poring over the document to understand \u201cits costs to the taxpayer, and to football, and any further implications\u201d.\n\nSteve Lawrence, who worked on the original concept for a London Games in 2003 and retains long-held concerns about the deal, said there could still be implications for the argument over state aid rules.\n\nAnd Jonathan Isaby of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance said: \u201cYou can\u2019t blame the club for taking advantage of the ludicrously generous taxpayer subsidy they\u2019ve been handed on a plate; instead we should be directing our anger and awkward questions at those responsible for offering a deal for which most clubs would have sold their star striker.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile the former Leyton Orient owner Barry Hearn, another standby in this tale of cock-up and conspiracy, said his dog could have negotiated a better deal for the taxpayer.\n\nNone of which is likely to concern West Ham, who continue to insist the deal is beneficial to all parties. They may have lost on Wednesday night but the full extent of their crushing victory off the pitch has now become clear.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Owen_Gibson,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0b3143e6b8691313bcc7b631b1f53c06", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=West+Ham+United%2COlympic+Stadium%2COlympic+legacy%2CFootball%2CSport%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec242ccd66efa79959840afa9c6bb6e197d212e8/277_396_3642_2186/master/3642.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f372d943a1a6e43e8269bef8f26b166b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec242ccd66efa79959840afa9c6bb6e197d212e8/277_396_3642_2186/3642.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74732644e48430806dce9c8ea76fd482", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec242ccd66efa79959840afa9c6bb6e197d212e8/277_396_3642_2186/3642.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74732644e48430806dce9c8ea76fd482", "date": "14/04/2016"}, "rank_12": {"title": "London Olympics legacy: jobs, jobs and jobs", "text": "There are prosperous views looking west from the roof of what was once the London 2012 Olympics press centre and is now part of a commercial complex called Here East, whose best known tenant is BT Sport: straight ahead for the City and the Shard; look left for more big money towers in Canary Wharf; further left and much nearer, the Olympic stadium is a short walk away. On the other side of Here East, across the Olympic Park, lies Stratford town centre with its luxurious Westfield mall. But beyond that stretches the rest of the London borough of Newham, one of the poorest places in the UK.\n\nInside the Here East building, Newham\u2019s Labour executive mayor Sir Robin Wales talked about jobs. He told a conference called Rising in the East that in the past six years the council\u2019s job brokerage, Workplace, which began in 2007, had got well over 30,000 local people into jobs - people who had never worked or who had been unemployed for a long time. The secret, he said, has been to partner with local employers to help Newham residents to seize the opportunities the rapid development of this part of east London has brought - not just since the Olympics, but from the early years of this century with Westfield\u2019s investment in Stratford City and the steady, long-term eastward shift of the capital\u2019s economic centre of gravity.\n\nEarlier that morning (Wednesday), plans for the expansion of City Airport had been approved by the government, following London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s dropping of objections to it that had been made by his predecessor, Boris Johnson. Green AM Caroline Russell, whose party would like the airport closed, is dismayed, calling the decision \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cterrible news\u201d. Clyde Loakes, deputy leader and cabinet member for the environment of Labour-run Waltham Forest, one of Newham\u2019s fellow post-Olympic \u201cgrowth boroughs\u201d, deemed it \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d and a \u201ckick in the teeth\u201d for residents of what he says is the third most overflown of the city\u2019s 32 boroughs. Sir Robin, though, made it clear he was delighted: more flights means more business, means more growth, means still more jobs.\n\nAnother participant in the Rising in the East event, organised by thinktank Centre for London, was John Burton, Westfield\u2019s head of development. He said the company had not moved in expecting the Olympic bid to be successful. When it was, the Newham mayor got on their case: \u201cRobin\u2019s message to us was \u2018sort yourselves out\u2019. He saw the opportunity for us as investors. Every time we had a negotiation with us, he left us with a very simple message: \u2018I want jobs, I want jobs and I want more jobs\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, there are jobs and there are jobs and there are jobs. London\u2019s Poverty Profile for 2015 showed that Newham\u2019s unemployment rate, as a proportion of the economically active, fell by 1% to 8.6% between 2011 and 2014 and that during the same period the rate of workless benefit claimants dropped from 13.8% among working age people to 10.2%. However, between 2010 and 2014, the proportion of employees in Newham categorised as low paid rose from 25% to 35% and the proportion of low paid jobs done by Newham employees went up from 17% to 29%.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015, Newham\u2019s position in the league table of most deprived local authority districts according to the government\u2019s index of multiple deprivation dropped from second to 25th place, only one notch above Islington (see page 15). The borough has produced a graphic mapping out the detail of this change. But some of it may be due to demographic shifts, as young, middle income households looking for relatively cheap places to buy move into terraced houses in Plaistow or shared ownership flats around the Royal Docks - they are \u201cswarming in\u201d, Sir Robin remarked. \u201cThe growth in zero hours contracts, insecure and part-time jobs limits progress,\u201d wrote the LSE\u2019s otherwise upbeat Anne Power in an early legacy assessment three years ago.\n\nNewham is conscious that many of the jobs of longer established residents don\u2019t pay very well. It says it is striving to raise skills levels among locals through tie-ins with employers and points to a recent initiative with Lloyds and property developer Lendlease to boost construction industry careers. Newham adds that it is pressing the government, as yet without success, to allow it to enforce payment of the national minimum wage. The council says it knows from its housing panel survey that nearly one in five of the borough\u2019s residents in work does not receive it, let alone the higher, voluntary London Living wage.\n\nSir Robin expressed disappointment that Newham and other growth boroughs such as Hackney - whose City Hall-bound mayor Jules Pipe he credited with getting Hear East converted and occupied - and Tower Hamlets have not received the Games legacy support needed from post-Labour national governments. He did, though, say he was proud of what Newham has fought for and achieved. \u201cNo Olympic Games in previous history has made a difference to a poor community sitting right next to it,\u201d he said, and concluded that London is the only Olympic city so far to have secured \u201canything like\u201d a local legacy of that kind. \u201cWe can keep building on that,\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e708bd82d8aa3e98f31333937555613f9b5944/0_302_4032_2419/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0891a74d1966bdf3e79611689ad7d538", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=UK+news%2CUnemployment%2CSociety%2CRegeneration%2CCommunities%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+Games%2CLocal+politics%2CLocal+government%2CPolitics%2CLondon+politics%2CLondon%2CThinktanks", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e708bd82d8aa3e98f31333937555613f9b5944/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=aabe5dbf0dc13e79b77c43ccb77fd8ae", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e708bd82d8aa3e98f31333937555613f9b5944/0_302_4032_2419/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0891a74d1966bdf3e79611689ad7d538", "date": "27/07/2016"}, "rank_88": {"title": "The trouble with the Olympic Games", "text": "In light of the Russian doping scandal, London\u2019s debatable legacy and the craven prostrations of prospective future hosts, the Olympic ideal looks shabby indeed as we draw closer to Rio. What is the point of the Games today?\n\nIn July 2005, a few days after London was awarded the 2012 Olympic Games, I took the Docklands Light Railway to Pudding Mill Lane. It was a journey I have repeated at intervals ever since, before and after the Olympics \u2013 but not during, when the authorities deemed it helpful to shut the station most convenient for the main stadium.\n\nEleven years ago this was an ugly, forgotten area full of grubby but useful businesses: small factories, reclamation yards, purveyors of obscure car parts. It had the kind of unplanned, bottom-up energy more associated with south Asia than London. Likewise the streets, which were filthy and (there was a heatwave) fly-blown. In the canal I found half a motorcycle. Under the railway bridge was a sign reading \u201cFuck the Bid\u201d.\n\nRevealed: the biggest threat to the future of the Olympic Games | Andy Bull Read more\n\nI made the journey again this month, as the Rio Olympics, which starts next Friday, heaves into view. I turned left as of old, under the now graffito-free bridge. There was still building work going on \u2013 for Crossrail and on the stadium itself, the new home of West Ham United. Within moments I was shouted at, hauled back and ordered to take a circuitous route into the Olympic park, now a huge grey, puddly open space, windswept even in July, broken up by its three main landmarks: the stadium, the Aquatics Centre and the ArcelorMittal Orbit, now half-converted into a helter-skelter, and surely the most repulsive piece of public art ever commissioned.\n\nThe canal had indeed been beautified and the \u201cpark\u201d was surrounded by trees, but uncomfortable-looking ones, just like those planted for the Beijing Olympics, which had the air of having been force-marched in from the countryside at bayonet-point. London has wildflower beds, but even these were regimented. The prettiest things in sight were the cranes over Stratford, creating unplanned, temporary geometrical shapes against the sky. Old Olympic parks across the world are habitually forlorn: two weeks of glory, decades of rot.\n\n\n\nThe Aquatics Centre does seem well used, though nearly all the water is divided into Olympic-type lanes for the dutiful swimming favoured by office workers, rather than the wet larks of childhood. A few people were in the Orbit. And the centrepiece of Sebastian Coe\u2019s much-vaunted legacy, the stadium itself, was about to stage last weekend\u2019s Anniversary Games, an event so important that at dawn on Monday it was not in the top 18 stories on the BBC Sport home page. Next month the stadium will go into regular use \u2013 unlike those in Athens and Beijing \u2013 as the de facto property of London\u2019s fourth-best football team: an almost free gift from the British people to that most deserving of causes, a Premier League club.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Two weeks of glory, decades of rot? \u2026 the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Games. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian\n\nI am not anti-sport: I have happily spent much of my working life as a sports writer. I am not anti-Olympics: I have reported seven Games in all, and have rich memories. I believe a passing alien would regard the event\u2019s existence as a tribute to our planet, the Paralympics even more so.\n\nI am, however, an Olymposceptic. I always opposed holding them in London, and never wavered even during the 17 days four summers ago when even my staunchest allies faltered. I felt like the man in trunks on a nudist beach; the unbeliever at a mass Moonie wedding. Late one night I bared my soul to a kindly colleague who had spent seven years covering every detail of the build-up. \u201cI drank the Kool-Aid,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt was the only way to cope.\u201d The London Olympics met no genuine national policy need, not one. But they were conceived under one prime minister who preferred the show to the substance, Tony Blair, and executed under another, David Cameron.\n\nIn 2012 Britain did not need to rehabilitate itself from utter national disgrace (Tokyo 1964, Munich 1972), nor impress its progress on an unknowing world (Seoul 1988), nor spend billions on a tourist advertising campaign (Barcelona 1992). There would have been a purpose had the Birmingham and Manchester bids of the late 20th century succeeded: rebalancing the economy away from the south-east. But they were always doomed.\n\nSochi 2014: the costliest Olympics yet but where has all the money gone? | Owen Gibson Read more\n\nNo lasting benefit from London\u2019s agreeable binge has ever been authenticated: east London would have been bourgeoisified anyway, if that\u2019s a benefit. The alleged effect on making youth leap off their sofas and on to sports fields was a chimera: a study quoted in the vital text on the whole Games-hosting industry, Circus Maximus by Andrew Zimbalist, showed that no Olympics has ever achieved that.\n\nAnd personally, I seriously doubt the endlessly quoted figure of \u00a39bn as the true cost of the London Olympics. Once Blair\u2019s original back-of-a-fag-packet numbers were junked shortly after the bid was accepted, this number became holy writ. I have no evidence to challenge it whatever, except my memory of the scoreboard in Greenwich Park, site of the equestrian competition. It was inadequate and barely visible. This made me realise the extent to which everything else was working brilliantly. On time, as it had to be, on budget, perfectly done. In Britain? No secret Treasury slush fund? No sleight of hand? Really?\n\nThe good thing about Britain is that the rule of law applies. The homes of the poor, the hutongs and favelas, could not be whimsically bulldozed, as in Beijing or Rio. The process of expelling the businesses, as detailed by the salmon smoker Lance Forman in his new book Forman\u2019s Games, was a very British one: furtive, grinding, mean-minded. I first visited Forman\u2019s old factory, close to Pudding Mill Lane, that day in 2005. I may have unknowingly trodden the same spot this month.\n\nForman got a good deal in the end, because he fought the various bodies driving the clearances hardest and longest \u2013 at the expense, he once told me, of actually running the business. Others accepted their fate and disappeared, grumbling, to new and less desirable sites in Essex and elsewhere. \u201cYou can\u2019t stand in the way of progress,\u201d as a more pliant generation used to say when motorways scrunched their homes in the 1960s.\n\nThe question that now has to be asked is to what extent the Olympic Games, in its current form, does constitute progress. London was a relatively benign example. Look at the bigger picture and the Olympics are failing on multiple levels: economic, political, humanitarian. And sporting.\n\nZimbalist cites 19 different reports from 2002 onwards showing that Olympic and World Cup hosts derived minimal or negative benefits in employment, tourism and general growth. The empty hotel room has become as much a symbol of the Olympics as the five rings. Mostly, as in London, this reality is tucked away under layers of propaganda, although the locus classicus remains Montreal 1976. \u201cThe Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby,\u201d swanked Mayor Jean Drapeau. That baby was 30 years old before the city paid off the debt.\n\nAwareness of the Olympics\u2019 dark side is growing. Brazil has been in ferment. Tokyo, the 2020 host, is restless. Boston and Hamburg had to stop bidding for 2024 because of protests. By the 2030s it will probably only be only egomaniac leaders, mostly unelected, who will even dare to get involved.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Maracana Olympic stadium and a partially demolished favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nThe IOC loves to present itself as a force for good in international relations. But the Russian drug scandal is a reminder that, as in the three successive Games in the 1970s and 80s at which one bloc or another staged major boycotts, the Olympics can be an irritant rather than soothing balm.\n\nThe humanitarian cost? A decade ago the Geneva-based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions (COHRE) reckoned that in the previous 20 years, starting with 720,000 forced evictions before Seoul 1988, more than two million people had lost their homes to provide Olympic venues. That was before a final figure could be estimated for Beijing 2008, let alone Rio. Sadly COHRE now seems to be defunct; perhaps the office was demolished.\n\nSizewise, the Games are out of control. The IOC is beset by claimants \u2013 administrators for lesser sports \u2013 who are desperate for a slice of the action. The Olympics likes young sports such as skateboarding and big sports like tennis and, new this year, golf and rugby, though it degrades its own brand by staging second-rate tournaments. To the heroic zillionaire stars of those sports, the whole thing is at best an optional extra, often a distraction, and at worst a source of holy terror. (\u201cOMG! They have mosquitoes in Brazil! I\u2019m not going!\u201d)\n\nWhat the Olympics means for the people of Rio Read more\n\nAll this is in part an essential distraction because interest in the main Olympic product, athletics, is in freefall after decades of drug crises that the IOC has done its utmost to ignore. I have often spent the days beforehand asking locals which part of the Games they are looking forward to. The answer, almost invariably, is either the opening ceremony (which is interminable) or the 100 metres (which lasts nine seconds). It is rare now for stars to come from nowhere, like the eastern European gymnasts of the 1970s, to captivate the world. Each country seems to stage its own Olympics now, cheering on its own performers, mediated by its own one-eyed TV commentators and idiot interviewers (\u201cHow special was that?\u201d), ignoring foreigners.\n\nFor Britain, a gold medal was quite special in the days when the total haul was four or five. It was 19 in Beijing and 29 in London. And yet what we ought to know by now is that this is essentially transactional. Well-funded elite programmes lead inexorably to medals: an estimated \u00a34.5m per gold in London. There is no trickle-down; if anything these handouts sap money that could have been better used on well placed and much-needed facilities. If the number of golds goes back down to single figures, I shall treat that as a tribute to George Osborne.\n\nThe IOC used to deprecate the medals table: the concept of a nation \u201cwinning the Olympics\u201d was considered contrary to the Olympic spirit. But increasingly that\u2019s not what is meant by winning. London and Rio were deemed to have \u201cwon\u201d the Games by staging them, pyrrhic though these victories have proved.\n\nIt does not have to be so dreadful. It is this ceaseless search to find the next host that is most of all wrecking the Olympics, inducing cities to fritter billions on facilities that have no useful afterlife and destroy the lives of the poor who get in the way. The same process has produced such monstrosities as the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and, lying in wait for us all, the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nAbandoned Athens Olympic 2004 venues, 10 years on \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nFor the summer Games at least, there is a potential solution: returning the Olympics to its ancient home. Greece is ideally placed geographically. Athens produced a serviceable Games in 2004, after much panic, cockup and, doubtless, corruption beforehand. It is now thought to have a world-record number of venues rotting away to no purpose. Take away the need to start from scratch every four years and the event \u2013 even allowing for Greece being Greece \u2013 could acquire the orderliness and patina of tradition and calm programme of improvements that attend the golf at Augusta and the tennis at Wimbledon.\n\nOnce that happened, tourists would no longer shy away; billions would dream of attending the Olympics once in their lives, and millions would do so. It would also make a secure profit that would allow facilities to be built globally where they are needed. Yes, there would be downsides and implacable opposition. Much of that would come from US TV.

It is somewhere that feels more like an accidental suburban campus than a real piece of London \u2013 a place where the different functions that make up a city have been separated out, each built without much thought given to how they relate.\n\nThe sports venues are all enjoying healthy afterlives, some at more expense than others. The once flat-pack stadium has finally been made permanent, retrofitted to host West Ham Football Club at a cost that brings its total to more than \u00a3700m. Olympic chiefs now admit the demountable arena was a preposterous idea, but they simply couldn\u2019t find a permanent tenant at the time. The Pringle-shaped velodrome continues to delight, hovering above the wilder northern half of the park, while the awkwardness of finding the entrance to Zaha Hadid\u2019s Aquatics Centre is mainly forgiven once you\u2019re paddling beneath its impressive whale-like roof.\n\nHawkins\\Brown's Nu Rave Pompidou at Here East, Olympic Park A photo posted by Olly Wainwright (@ollywainwright) on Jul 23, 2016 at 7:00am PDT\n\nAcross the park, the gargantuan hangars of the media and press centres, which many feared would be the hardest to find a viable use for, have been reborn as Here East, a data centre and tech startup hub that styles itself as \u201cthe most ambitious technology innovation centre Europe has ever seen\u201d.

Photograph: Forbes Massie/Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\nThe park itself, which once felt like a manicured golf course airlifted here from Florida, is already wonderfully mature. The promised shagginess, so characteristic of the Lea, has been allowed to return (minus the heaps of car tyres and piles of fridges), while its sloping lawns and elaborate playscapes throng with local families every weekend. If this all sounds like an achievement, it is. At this stage in the process, most other host cities were still fighting over what to do with their Olympic remains. But things get less comfortable when you look more closely at what\u2019s lurking beyond the shrubbery.\n\nInto Orbit: my dizzying drop down the world's biggest slide Read more\n\nIn fact, you don\u2019t need to look hard. The car crash of post-Olympic Stratford slams you in the face from most areas of the park. There is the cut-and-paste hulk of Westfield shopping mall and the marching eastern bloc slabs of the former athletes\u2019 village, now joined by a cacophony of luxury stumps poking on to the horizon. There\u2019s Glasshouse Gardens (\u201cthe address that addresses it all\u201d), Stratford Central (\u201credefining the London skyline\u201d) and, pride of place on the edge of the park, the sloping monster wedge of a Unite student housing block, rightly shortlisted for the Carbuncle Cup, along with the woeful steel tangle of the ArcelorMittal Orbit \u2013 so far costing \u00a310,000 a week to maintain.\n\n\u201cThe middle classes are swarming into our borough at a rate of knots,\u201d says Robin Wales, the Labour mayor of Newham \u2013 one of four London boroughs straddled by the Olympic park \u2013 who seems alternately proud of and alarmed by the phenomenon, depending on his audience. Arguably, he should have been more wary of the speculative investors who flocked here to reap the spoils of the Olympic goldrush, their ambition now wrought on the skyline as a physical bar-chart of inflated land values.\n\nMuch of what has materialised so far dates from a pre-existing plan for a mixed-use commercial development around Stratford station, once known as Stratford City, which was conveniently hijacked and accelerated by the games. The muddled history is evident in the result: the gilded souks of Westfield lie on one side of the tracks (wildly successful, with a footfall of 42 million a year), while the athletes\u2019 village stands on the other. Built at a cost of \u00a31bn to the taxpayer, the 2,800 homes, since branded East Village to give them a metropolitan ring, were later sold to Qatar for around half that amount. On the plus side, half the units are available for affordable rent, which is a significantly higher proportion than what has come along since.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The sloping monster wedge\u2019 ... Unite\u2019s Carbuncle Cup shortlisted student housing close to the Olympic Park. Photograph: George Rex\n\nThe next phase of Stratford City, known as the International Quarter, is only now becoming apparent. Developed by Lendlease, the Australian giant behind the controversial regeneration of the Heygate estate, this dense cluster of office buildings, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, will contain 4m sq ft of workspace, forming a glacial cliff-edge along the eastern edge of the park, opposite Zaha\u2019s swooping pool. Jollied up with some of Rogers\u2019 trademark red and yellow lift cores, these commercial slabs will at least block the view of Stratford\u2019s tackier towers.\n\nAt 42 storeys, Manhattan Loft Gardens is one shaft that refuses to be blocked out. Standing between Westfield and the East Village, it is the brainchild of Harry Handelsman, the maverick developer of St Pancras Chambers and the Chiltern Firehouse, who insists it will be \u201cthe most exciting tower ever built\u201d, its terraced gardens creating \u201ca true vertical community\u201d. A community marketed by Harrods might not be quite the legacy Olympic bods had in mind when they talked of the 12,000 new homes that would arrive here, at the nexus of four of London\u2019s poorest boroughs. Yet the wider impact of the Olympic project has been to sprinkle a kind of steroidal fairy dust across surrounding sites, fertilising muscular slabs of ever more luxurious investment units \u2013 as if the athletes weren\u2019t the only ones doping. On such developments around the edge the park, the legacy planning team has achieved an average of less than 19% affordable housing.\n\nOn developments around the edge the park, the legacy team has achieved an average of less than 19% affordable housing\n\nWithin the bounds of the park itself, the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), the mayoral vehicle responsible for managing the legacy \u2013 a similar model to the London Docklands Development Corporation, responsible for the creation Canary Wharf \u2013 has been able to exert a bit more control. Alarmed by what was appearing the other side of the fence, they redrew the overarching plan, scaling back the number of homes to around 7,000. What was going to be a world of high-density blocks similar to the athletes\u2019 village, became a low-rise cosy vision of more Londony things like terraces and squares, mansion blocks and mews houses.\n\nThe first phase, Chobham Manor, south of the majestic velodrome, is still mostly under construction but shaping up well. The launch saw people queuing up overnight to snap up some of the 850 units off-plan (two-bed mews houses for \u00a3695,000, five-bed townhouses for \u00a31m), perhaps more a sign of London\u2019s dysfunctional housing market than any indicator of the quality of the scheme. It is a perfectly fine arrangement of terraces and low-rise apartment blocks, in tune with the recent bricky London vernacular, but \u2013 built by volume house-builder Taylor Wimpey and designed by corporate architects PRP and Make \u2013 it is not exactly the most dazzling outcome such a unique opportunity could have delivered.\n\nEast Wick and Sweetwater, the next phases \u2013 across the canal from Hackney Wick and Fish Island along the western edge of the park \u2013 look set to follow a similar model, only built by Balfour Beatty and the marginally more interesting architecture practices of Sheppard Robson and Studio Egret West. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a place that feels rooted in the London vernacular,\u201d says Dan Burr, partner at Sheppard Robson. \u201cIt should have the richness and diversity of a typical Hackney neighbourhood that\u2019s evolved over the years.\u201d\n\nThese are encouraging words, and most of the plan looks good, but it is still a decidedly suburban model, with little thought for mixed use. A question mark looms at the eastern edge of the site, where the buildings could shoot up in scale in response to what has just been proposed next door. The word \u201clandmark\u201d has been whispered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Not the most dazzling outcome such a unique opportunity could have delivered \u2026 Chobham Manor\n\nIt\u2019s clear they want some stature to match what will now be a 47-storey gateway to the Olympic park, the pair of luxury apartment towers that will trumpet the jewel in the crown of the legacy vision. This is a cultural mega-hub where the V&A, Sadler\u2019s Wells and London College of Fashion will huddle together, forming an island of civilisation at the foot of Rogers\u2019 office blocks. Formerly known as Olympicopolis, now catchily rebranded as the Stratford Waterfront Cultural and Education District, this \u00a3850m complex is the work of Allies and Morrison, the safe-pair-of-hands architects in charge of much of the Olympic masterplan, and O\u2019Donnell + Tuomey, Ireland\u2019s unparalleled magicians of bricks.\n\nLatest vision revealed for Olympicopolis arts quarter in east London Read more\n\nA family of staggered boxy forms set on a stepped podium of sloping ramps and terraces, the proposals appear to have some of the best qualities of the Southbank Centre, with overhanging levels to perch and people-watch, and plenty of sheltered spaces for outdoor performances and events. \u201cWe want the buildings to feel raw, robust and ready for work,\u201d says Alex Wraight, partner at Allies and Morrison. \u201cThe place will have a wharf-like quality, in tune with the industrial heritage of the area.\u201d\n\nWith such effusive, attention-grabbing neighbours, choosing not to shout so loud was wise, although there\u2019s a danger it might all feel a bit dour. Given the dream brief, to combine three prestigious cultural institutions on a riverside site, many were hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz.\n\nEven so, the life of the tenants should brighten it up. The V&A East promises to be an \u201centirely new kind of civic institution\u201d, a platform for experimentation and making, while Sadler\u2019s Wells\u2019 outpost will incorporate a hip-hop academy for local youth alongside its 550-seat dance theatre. The presence of 6,500 fashion students won\u2019t go amiss either, providing ready-made beautiful people to drape themselves stylishly across the terraces.\n\n\n\nGiven all the money spent, they really have made a disappointing job of it Mark Brearley, Cass school\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The proposed V&A East, whose shifting form is \u2018inspired by the drawers of a Japanese incense box in the museum\u2019s collection\u2019. Photograph: Forbes Massie/Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\nThe only elephant in the room, one that every architecture team wrestled with in the competition, is the presence of the two enormous towers at the northern end of the site, the supersized counterweight in the rickety see-saw of legacy financing. As LLDC development director Rosanna Lawes puts it: \u201cThese are the harsh realities of the need to fund this scheme.\u201d\n\nIt is a recurring theme across the park, where the financial imperative to pay back the crushing Olympic debt looms large over every plot. It is the same reason the promise of setting aside sites for brave experiments with community land trusts and custom-build projects rapidly faded away when the accountants saw the sums, and why all the neighbourhoods planned so far only can only muster an average of 30% affordable housing.\n\n\u201cAs a board, we have to pay back the money we\u2019ve borrowed to do the work so far, using land sales to the private sector,\u201d says LLDC chair David Edmonds. Pressed on why there isn\u2019t a higher proportion of affordable rents across the park, he is frank: \u201cWe have yet to find an economic mechanism that provides that rent level.\u201d\n\nThe trouble with the Olympic Games Read more\n\nThey\u2019re going to have to find a way, and fast. In one of his first moves as London mayor, Sadiq Khan has put pressure on the legacy team to up their game to providing 50% affordable housing. The next phases, at Marshgate Wharf and Pudding Mill at the southern end of the park, are currently being revised to meet the new target. A significantly higher density to pay for it all is the likely outcome.\n\nOverall, there remain many of the problems and awkwardness you might expect with trying to fit a new piece of city on an island site configured for a fleeting mass event. \u201cI still wince at some of the infrastructure,\u201d says Selina Mason, former design director in charge of post-Games transformation, who\u2019s now heading up the masterplan for a new UCL campus at the southern end of the park. \u201cThe roads were designed to get athletes and officials around the site as quickly as possible, but I wish we\u2019d focused much more on pedestrians.\u201d\n\nFor all that\u2019s been achieved in four years, critics of the plan still decry the project as a woefully missed opportunity. \u201cGiven all the money spent, and a can\u2019t-fail general situation, they really have made a disappointing job of it,\u201d says Mark Brearley, professor of cities at London Metropolitan\u2019s Cass school, whose work has long focused on the Lea Valley. \u201cThe urban structure has been totally flunked. All that is being achieved is fairly incoherent steroided suburb, with a nice park.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not too late for bold thinking to return, for Sadiq Khan to grasp the nettle and insist the role of city-shaping is taken more seriously. Given the unique position of the LLDC as the sole landowner, planning authority and budget-holder, this is a one-off chance to make this a progressive, inclusive, direction-setting place. Compared to the desolate wastes left by many other Olympics, it might be judged a roaring success, but as a new piece of London we can be proud of, it can still do so much better.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3e2286c4ea76b6dd67c7b575308c13f5b95d51b/0_0_1024_682/master/1024.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8607475c56eed98c1ed43f0303ab975d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ba796e7dae6fc9fd4861ea3915ed7783f4d0a6/0_0_4472_4153/master/4472.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93ec246955891aeff3ac4001601ea362", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Architecture%2COlympic+Games%2CDesign%2CArt+and+design%2CHousing%2CCommunities%2CSociety%2CLondon%2CSadiq+Khan%2CUK+news%2CCities%2CMuseums%2CV%26A%2CSadler%27s+Wells%2CCulture%2CUCL+%28University+College+London%29%2CHigher+education%2CSport", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cce4402714ee7e6b39ab1e330f5f1369dde2f0d/0_612_4000_3388/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e05f1f3e210cb86b6aaea76c62dc5b7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6f32968908b3138419c5fe2aaa6c2b6b3507f8/0_0_2500_1429/master/2500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=720b35c68db44a31a9cc50214aa5728e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Oliver-Wainwright,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e1aa270c46b716e34c4783ced3376cc9", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fc65085004aa55d2039ea36e24a068d98264024/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c380022d81c350e7620e11a8b5fbe313", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fc65085004aa55d2039ea36e24a068d98264024/0_200_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5238897da816af08039b789324a640e"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fc65085004aa55d2039ea36e24a068d98264024/0_200_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5238897da816af08039b789324a640e", "date": "03/08/2016"}, "rank_41": {"title": "Charities seek return of \u00a3425m lotto cash borrowed for London Olympics", "text": "More than \u00a3400m diverted from supporting communities in need across the UK to help fund the London 2012 Olympics has yet to be returned, and the shortfall has raised questions about the Games\u2019 legacy.\n\nWith the 2016 Rio Olympics now underway, there are calls for the new mayor of London and the prime minister to ensure the cash \u2013 taken from the Big Lottery Fund which makes small grants to local charities \u2013 is paid back.\n\nThe previous mayor of London, Boris Johnson, stated that a key legacy aim of the 2012 Games was the \u201cconvergence in life chances and prosperity between east and west London, and to bring the city and its communities together\u201d. But charities say the failure to return the lottery cash has undermined this commitment.\n\nCiaran Price, policy officer with the Directory of Social Change, the organisation that campaigns to improve conditions for charities in the UK and is leading calls for the return of the money, said: \u201cThe government failed to honour its promise to Britain\u2019s communities, which have been struggling in the wake of a devastating recession, to repay the \u00a3425m it took from the Big Lottery Fund to construct the Olympic Village.\n\n\u201cWhile many charities are seeing demand for their services rising at a speed never before experienced, and while they are finding it more and more difficult to get the financial support they need to meet this new level of demand, the government has been sitting on this money, continuously trying to kick it further into the long grass, hoping we\u2019ll somehow forget about it.\u201d\n\nWest Ham's Olympic Stadium deal benefits taxpayer, claims David Gold Read more\n\nIt emerged after the Games that the government had underspent on the Olympics by more than \u00a3500m but, despite this, none of the \u00a3425m taken from the Big Lottery Fund has been returned to good causes.\n\nCharities were further dismayed when the Olympic stadium, which cost \u00a3486m to build, was handed over to the Premier League football club West Ham on a 99-year lease, at a cost to the club of \u00a32.5m a year. The Directory of Social Change has now written to both mayor of London Sadiq Khan and the prime minister, calling on them to intervene.\n\nThe organisation says it is vital that lottery money goes to the charitable causes for which it is intended. In its letter to Theresa May, it points out that when she was shadow secretary for culture, media and sport she stated: \u201cWe believe that the lottery should be independent of government but accountable to parliament. It should not become a tool of government.\u201d\n\nIn a speech to parliament in 2005, May claimed that governments should not be able to raid lottery funds. \u201cEvery pound that the government choose to snaffle that way is a pound that cannot go to help community groups or to preserve our historic buildings.\u201d\n\nDebra Allcock Tyler, chief executive of the Directory of Social Change, claims in the letters that more than 10,000 charities could be supported if the money were returned, and around eight million people would benefit.\n\nShe acknowledges that the government has committed to repay the money via the sale of assets in the Olympic park. But the previous and current governments have said this will not happen until the next decade at the earliest, and possibly the one after.\n\n\u201cThis is too late for so many communities in need,\u201d Allcock Tyler says in her letter to Khan. \u201cWe maintain that giving back this money now would make a huge difference to organisations and the individuals they serve across London and the rest of the UK at a time when so many people are in need of support.\u201d\n\nHow West Ham struck the deal of the century with Olympic Stadium move Read more\n\nThe Directory of Social Change claims that the Brexit vote has given a renewed urgency to claiming back the millions owed to the Big Lottery Fund.

It is owned by Network Rail and leased to logistics company DB Schenker as an operational rail freight facility.\n\nThe LLDC said post-Olympics transformation planning consent specifically required the area to be returned to its use as an operational rail freight facility. \u201cOnly development supporting the rail related and small-scale ancillary uses will be supported,\u201d it said.\n\nThe corporation pointed out that the use of the area as a warm-up zone for athletes during the 2012 Olympics was only temporary. \u201cThe site is safeguarded as strategic industrial land as it is a rail head and that is what it had to return to after its Games-time role had been completed,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nSeveral local residents who have submitted written objections acknowledge that the site was historically zoned for industry, but question whether this is appropriate given the number of people who now live in the regenerated area.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The site of the proposed cement works at Pudding Mill Lane. Photograph: Lisa O'Carroll/The Guardian\n\n\u201cI honestly can\u2019t think of a worse place for a heavy industrial site than the Olympic park. Callous, short-term profiteering, with no regard for the families and people who live nearby having to breath this air, and live next to a blight upon Britain\u2019s international legacy,\u201d Jon Linnell from Leicester wrote on the petition.\n\nRaising an objection, local resident Adam Stork wrote to the LLDC, saying: \u201cAlthough the site historically has been zoned for industrial use, the majority of local land has now been re-zoned for residential and commercial developments.\n\n\u201cTo allow high-level industrial activity nearby will reduce the quality of life for all around it.\u201d\n\nVivienne Bellamy, in a written submission to the LLDC, said: \u201cThis would not be allowed to happen in South Kensington, against which Olympicopolis is already measuring itself.\u201d\n\nIn a written submission, Tower Hamlets council said it had broadly accepted the principle of the land use, but said the predicted HGV traffic was \u201cundoubtedly very high\u201d and would have a significant impact on the environment.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario, with the plants operating 24 hours a day, the council said there would be \u201c935 HGV movements\u201d in and out of the site daily.\n\nThe architect Mark Brearley, a professor of cities at the Cass and previously a design adviser to the former London mayor Boris Johnson, has said he supports the plans. If anyone is at fault, he said, it is the mayor\u2019s office for not coming up with a proper plan for mixed development on the Olympic park.\n\n\u201cOn the face of it, it is a good idea to reintroduce these uses for these sites. It it a rail serviced site, has potential water transport [via the river Lea]. There is an environmental challenge, for sure, but if we expel all industry, it defaults to a suburb on steroids with an economy that is only about sports, high-end services and education,\u201d he said.\n\nThe LLDC, he said, was to blame for the number of new residents, which was a result of \u201callowing so many residential developments\u201d.\n\nThe Olympic park planning application pinned to a lamppost.

It could have all been so different, judging by an inventive, rejected proposal seen here for the first time\n\nWhat a place Olympicopolis could be. The cultural building project, part of a \u00a31.3bn development in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, could be for its generation what the Pompidou Centre was for the 1970s: a vortex of architectural and artistic energy with the power to change everything, one that could drag the creative centre of London towards its former badlands in the east. It includes, after all, a new venue for Sadler\u2019s Wells theatre, the V&A\u2019s \u201cnew museum for the digital age\u201d and a \u201cfashion cluster\u201d for the Royal College of Fashion. It could convert the giddy Olympian optimism of 2012 into wonders that will unfold over decades. It could be, to use the favourite adjective of eternally amazed sports broadcasters, incredible.\n\nBut according to three venerable architects, quoted by the Architects Journal \u2013 Royal Academicians, still with fire in their bellies from their 1960s youths \u2013 it will not. \u201cDull as ditchwater,\u201d says Will Alsop, who likes to turn bright, splashy paintings into bright, splashy buildings. \u201cThis group of buildings readily sinks into the soft corners of one\u2019s brain,\u201d says Sir Peter Cook, 80 this year, and the most talkative member of the radical 1960s group Archigram, \u201cin the same way that under-amplified Vivaldi can be fed to you in a gift shop.\u201d \u201cTried and tired,\u201d says Ian Ritchie, who recently completed a wavy translucent building for a neuroscience research centre at University College London.\n\nAll three oppose the style in which Olympicopolis is being designed: careful, orderly, curveless, white/cream/beige/brown, mostly right-angled. In the case of Cook, his outburst is a continuation of recent attacks on what he calls the \u201cbiscuit boys\u201d, architects who \u201cenjoy what I call the grim, biscuit-coloured world\u201d, which presumably refers to the dry, flat, brownish brickwork they employ. This style, sometimes also called the New London Vernacular, is now the pervasive way of designing everything from large speculative housing blocks to thoughtful arts centres. British architecture, says Cook, is now in a \u201cdull period\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The rise of biscuitism\u2019: plans by architects Allies and Morrison, O\u2019Donnell and Tuomey and Josep Camps and Olga Felip for new spaces for the V&A, Sadler\u2019s Wells and the Royal College of Fashion, plus two residential skyscrapers, on the Stratford waterfront. Photograph: Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\nTo which the first thing that needs to be said is that the RA Three\u2019s version of exciting has been given some chances in recent history and hasn\u2019t looked like the answer. It includes Alsop\u2019s troubled cultural projects in West Bromwich and Liverpool, one built and the other cancelled, the shortcomings of which were nothing but tedious for those affected by them. Before the rise of biscuitism, the default style for speculative housing blocks was a sub-Alsopian splurge of garish cladding, which was worse.\n\nThe fundamental weakness is that the ensemble doesn\u2019t seem to rise to the extraordinariness of the project\n\nAs part of Archigram, Cook started out by championing fluid, adaptable, colourful, free-form architecture that would use the latest technologies to free people\u2019s lives and would be the opposite of the rigid monuments of previous generations. As can be seen at a celebratory exhibition at the Royal Academy, he offered blancmange, not biscuits, irradiated with artificial colouring. He contributed to the movement that led, indeed, to the Pompidou Centre. He backed the work of the late Zaha Hadid. Dramatic and sometimes magnificent shapes were invented. Unfortunately, though, free-form architecture of the kind Cook backed had a habit of being expensive, impractical and difficult to build, which meant that its fullest realisation would be by despots and elites for whom money was no object. The end results were as rigid and unliberating as the monuments against which they were supposed to react.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ole Scheeren\u2019s early scheme, \u2018a three-dimensional city of making, performance and interaction\u2019. Photograph: \u00a9 Buro-OS\n\nOn the 2012 site, next door to Olympicopolis, you can see why its makers wouldn\u2019t want to go the same way again. There is the fatuous ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture, which, despite a recent effort to enliven it by adding a slide, couldn\u2019t be more dull. There is Hadid\u2019s Aquatics Centre, the undoubted majesty of which came at a huge cost in money, steel and practical shortcomings. There is the Olympic Stadium, in which Cook was involved, possessed of a certain spare elegance, but which somehow lost its Archigrammy fun-ness on the way from design to realisation.\n\nOle Scheeren's proposal shows a level of ambition and invention that seems to have been too much for the LLDC\n\nYet looking at the images so far released of Olympicopolis, and while exercising due caution over the fact that the designs have not yet been revealed in their entirety, you have to say that Cook and co have a point. The different elements of the project are dutifully lined up in a row, thin, fat, little, large, like conscript soldiers at their first parade. The open spaces look generic, standard, nice-enough, ho-hum. Each block is variegated in its surface treatment, but somewhat pointlessly so. The V&A building has projections of solid over void that promise some drama but don\u2019t seem enough to puncture the polite boredom of the whole.\n\nThe team that won the competition to design Olympicopolis is a judicious mixture of Allies and Morrison, who are experienced and proficient, with O\u2019Donnell and Tuomey, who have shown themselves capable of artistic excitement in their previous building for the London School of Economics, and the youthful adventure of a Catalan pair, Josep Camps and Olga Felip. Perhaps the choice is too judicious, though, as its whole is less than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe fundamental weakness is that the ensemble doesn\u2019t seem to rise to the extraordinariness of the project \u2013 its piling up of art, design, dance and fashion, plus two residential skyscrapers to help pay for it all, next to a canal, in a place that not so long ago was a wilderness. Rather, the collective design behaves as if such things happen every day. The urge seems to be to make normal what is not. The impression is not that the forms of creativity these buildings will contain might be transformed by unprecedented inventions in the future, but that they will carry on in much the same way as now.\n\nLondon's Olympic legacy: a suburb on steroids, a cacophony of luxury stumps Read more\n\nIt could have been different. Indeed the London Legacy Development Corporation, which is in charge of making Olympicopolis happen, commissioned something different at an earlier stage in the process, when it asked the architect Ole Scheeren, a former colleague of Rem Koolhaas\u2019s who manages to be based in both Beijing and Berlin, to offer proposals of what might be done. This was a preliminary exploration, not a final project, but it could and should have been the basis for what is now being designed. It shows a level of ambition and invention that seems to have been too much for the LLDC.\n\nScheeren\u2019s idea, kept under wraps by the LLDC and published here for the first time, was to pile up, overlap and intersect the different institutions, such that they would share foyers and terraces. The project\u2019s publicly accessible spaces would climb through it to make a multi-level promenade. It would be one building and several, in which each institution would have its identity, but the whole would be a three-dimensional city of making, performance and interaction.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018So much human energy in one place\u2019: the plan for Ole Scheeren\u2019s Olympicopolis. Photograph: \u00a9 Buro-OS\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2026 and a cross-section view. Photograph: \u00a9 Buro-OS\n\nThe excitement would come not from the forced theatrics of unusual shapes, but from the intrinsic drama of putting so much human energy in one place, and it is this excitement that has been diluted to the point of vanishing. The different institutions have been divided up, each with their own plot, in a way familiar to Victorian builders of cultural enclaves. There is little guiding idea, little statement of the specific ways in which this might be a place like no other. This is the result of decisions made more by managers and politicians than by architects, but the architects don\u2019t seem to have done much to challenge it.\n\nWhat the Olympicopolis row reveals is a void in contemporary architecture, which neither careful thoughtfulness nor rhetorical form-making is able to fill. It is not about straight lines against curves or colour against monotones, but about the art of finding what is latent in every project, whether extraordinary or everyday, and making the most of it. It means fighting the constant pressure to revert to the standard. Otherwise, architecture will be condemned to an endless cycle of taste, of action and reaction. Biscuit, blancmange, biscuit, blancmange, biscuit, blancmange.

Craven says the Paralympics has not faced such circumstances in its 56-year history.\n\nIt\u2019s by no means all the fault of Brazil, whose government, badly strapped for cash, is doing its best to save the Paralympic Games. But it does show how incredibly difficult it can be to keep momentum going for disabled athletes, and disability issues generally.\n\nLet\u2019s move closer to home. There has been endless talk about the legacy of 2012 \u2013 have we really become fitter and sportier people as a result of watching all that sport? Has east London really benefited as well as it could have done from the Games? But what about the legacy of the London Paralympics?\n\nSince then we have had four hard years of austerity economics in this country, and no group has been as badly affected as disabled people: about half a million people have been hit.\n\nIn 2014, the Conservative welfare minister, Lord Freud, announced that some disabled people were not worth the minimum wage, and could be paid as little as \u00a32 an hour. The replacement of disability living allowance has caused mayhem for many of our most vulnerable people. Ministers backed down in March on the restrictions they had planned to personal independence payments (PIP), but there are a host of other reductions. The government\u2019s own figures ahead of the last budget suggested that cuts to disabled people would \u201csave\u201d taxpayers \u00a34.4bn.\n\nDisability hate crime: is 'benefit scrounger' abuse to blame? Read more\n\nHow? Well, among other things there is a \u00a340 cut coming next March for many new claimants of employment support allowance (ESA), around a third of the value of this crucial benefit. That equates to people not being able to cope, to having to rely on food banks, and occasionally to people killing themselves in despair. A third of those surveyed by the disability benefits consortium said they already had trouble feeding themselves, at the current ESA rate.\n\nIn a developed society, this can happen only where there is already an ingrained lack of compassion for those with disabilities. Disability campaigners are quite right that in one sense the Paralympic Games sets up a dangerous polarity between the \u201csuperhuman\u201d heroes on the one hand, and the \u201cfeckless, contemptible scroungers\u201d, as portrayed by the tabloids, on the other. Between sentimentality and venom, all that is missing is a clearsighted view of the vast majority of ordinary disabled people doing their decent best to get along, work, and live tolerable lives. But the binary heroes/scroungers, love \u2019em/loathe \u2019em mindset seems to be our woeful Paralympic legacy.\n\nAccording to data uncovered last year through the Freedom of Information Act, hate crimes against disabled people reported to the police during 2014-15 rose by 41%. The disability hate crimes network regards this as only the tip of a very nasty iceberg, and believes there are 60,000 such incidents a year.\n\nAll statistics should be regarded with caution but there is too much evidence on display of our shameful treatment of disabled people \u2013 from Treasury officials making \u201ceasy\u201d cuts, to newspapers slandering the unwell as scroungers \u2013 to be ignored. Frankly, that golden glow from the summer of 2012 has been betrayed, not just in Rio but every day on the streets of Britain. Meet the superhumans? Perhaps we should start to introduce ourselves to a few of them.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Disability%2CRio+2016%2COlympic+Games%2CSport%2CParalympics%2CDisability+and+sport%2CParalympics+2016%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed64d7955724cd6ef7d120a278399cbe1d443ebc/0_277_4096_2457/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2d7b05e5001f14f39abc6f3c396b2a6b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6809f6ee8028ac8618fc1e27b4e12521102cf15f/0_265_5616_3370/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db7e1326662062b187cc82f94962dea5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6809f6ee8028ac8618fc1e27b4e12521102cf15f/0_265_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=916f4ab139c731a61459f2bc2d53c65c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6809f6ee8028ac8618fc1e27b4e12521102cf15f/0_265_5616_3370/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=db7e1326662062b187cc82f94962dea5", "date": "25/08/2016"}, "rank_10": {"title": "London Olympics has brought regeneration, but at a price locals can\u2019t afford | Penny Bernstock", "text": "The London Olympics claimed that its most enduring legacy would be \u201cthe regeneration of an entire community for the direct benefit of everyone who lives there\u201d. It is clear however, four year on, that without a rethink the housing legacy will be marked by the rapid gentrification of Stratford and surrounding areas and a negligible gain of genuinely affordable housing.\n\nFrom the start there was a degree of vagueness about what the housing legacy would be, though terms such as \u201cmuch\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d were used in reference to the proportion of affordable housing that would be provided and this won over opposition to the demolition of existing housing. There was also tension between the vision of the Greater London Authority with ambitions for 50% affordable housing on new developments and the London Borough of Newham which while supportive was keen to encourage more market housing in Stratford.\n\nThe conversion of the Athletes\u2019 Village into East Village stands as a marker of success while highlighting the tensions in delivering genuinely affordable housing. It is a mixed-tenure development that includes 49% affordable housing. Half of this is for social rent and the rent formula was agreed under previous targets for social renting that make it genuinely affordable. The other half is \u201cintermediate\u201d, including a mix of shared ownership and units for rent at costs more closely linked to the market and at odds with local incomes. In 2015, median household incomes in Newham were just under \u00a329k, yet a two-bedroom intermediate unit required a minimum household income of \u00a348k and a three-bedroom shared ownership property a minimum household income of \u00a373k.\n\nIt was always assumed that the Olympic Park itself would be a key dimension of housing legacy. However, targets for affordable housing there have been revised down from 35%-40% in 2010 to a minimum of 20% and maximum of 35% in 2011, and a maximum of 31% in 2013. These cuts have been justified by the need to pay back debts and the loss of an uplift in land values following plans to accelerate development of two neighbourhoods.\n\nIt was also expected that hosting the games would accelerate the regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley and in 2005 \u201cplanning gain\u201d was an important mechanism for levering affordable housing on new developments. However with concerns about the viability of schemes, there is evidence of developers making minimal contributions. Five towers being built or recently completed in Stratford include only 8% on-site affordable housing, all of which is intermediate. Some of these schemes do include financial contributions to off-site housing for social rent, yet this excludes low income families from taking advantage of the area\u2019s improvements. These contradictions have led to local campaigns such as the Focus E15 Mums and Boleyn 100.\n\nOverall then we are not on track for an inclusive housing legacy. The policy context of 2016 is very different from 2005. Key instruments crucial to deliver affordable housing a decade ago no longer apply. Cuts to housing subsidy; the introduction of the 80% of market rates as the \u201caffordable rent\u201d model (in addition the introduction of the benefit cap and universal credit) and the declining value of planning gain will make it increasingly difficult for families on low incomes to live in high value areas. Plans for affordable housing have been diluted despite the increasing need for it. With a new London mayor committed to increasing affordable housing in the park is there a chance to return to the original promises? Since 2012, Newham has recorded the largest property price rises of any London borough and the area around the East Village has emerged as a \u201cbuy to let\u201d hotspot. Rental costs have also shot up and a combination of rising rents and the benefit cap make it increasingly difficult for households on low incomes to find accommodation in the area.\n\nHousing built on the park and in surrounding areas could become a test bed for new models of housing finance and delivery, with a minimum of 50% affordable housing. A key challenge for the London Legacy Development Corporation is the need to repay debts, yet some of these should be written off and the substantial increase in land values could be levered to fund genuinely affordable housing. The legacy could capitalise on the extensive construction knowledge in East London and establish its own building company guaranteeing decent wages and cross-subsidising housing for sale with housing for rent. The legacy has to be lasting and should be exempt from \u201cright to buy\u201d. This would remain in perpetuity as a gift to the people of London. Above all what is needed to realise the housing legacy promised by the London Olympics is the political will to achieve it.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716cb8392b786e671078890af990227c14429ed7/0_72_3170_2388/master/3170.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8970c954256433837db940558b00137d", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Housing%2CCommunities%2CSociety%2COlympic+legacy%2COlympic+Games+2012", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716cb8392b786e671078890af990227c14429ed7/0_478_3170_1902/3170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5762dcbc1402293335a130eaeb7282af", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716cb8392b786e671078890af990227c14429ed7/0_478_3170_1902/3170.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5762dcbc1402293335a130eaeb7282af", "date": "30/08/2016"}, "rank_33": {"title": "London Stadium chairman David Edmonds quits amid costs investigation", "text": "\u2022 Sadiq Khan ordered inquiry into soaring costs to taxpayer of running venue \u2022 Further departures from Olympic legacy company are likely\n\nThe chairman of the London Legacy Development Corporation, responsible for the former Olympic Stadium that is now home to West Ham United, has resigned after an inquiry was announced into soaring costs at the venue.\n\nDavid Edmonds had been chairman of the LLDC, which operates the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and co-owns the London Stadium with Newham Council, since September 2015 but has been heavily involved in the legacy project since 2009.\n\nHis departure is expected to be the first of several from the LLDC board after the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced an inquiry into the cost of converting the stadium into a dual-use athletics and football venue. Originally slated at \u00a3160m, the bill is now estimated to stand at \u00a3323m.\n\nOngoing operational costs have also risen, chiefly because the amount it costs to move the seats in and out over the summer has soared from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a38m per year.\n\nEdmonds, a former chairman of NHS Direct and telecoms regulator Oftel, previously held senior roles at the LLDC\u2019s predecessor, the Olympic Park Legacy Company, and E20 LLP, the joint venture that houses the stadium.\n\nThe situation, which Khan has blamed on his predecessor Boris Johnson, has been described by a spokesperson for the mayor as \u201ca total and utter mess\u201d.\n\nWest Ham stadium faces losses for years due to retractable-seating problems Read more\n\nOn Thursday the mayor\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cSadiq will now be looking to secure the very best possible candidate for this important role. He believes the stadium will continue to be a world-class sports and entertainment facility hosting major events.\u201d\n\nSome of the LLDC board members were due to leave in any case as their terms were up but the impending review is likely to make uncomfortable reading.\n\nWith West Ham negotiating hard for their \u00a32.5m-a-year tenancy deal, soaring conversion costs and the liquidation of their original seating contractor have led to a cashflow crisis that makes it unlikely the stadium will break even for many years. Other members of the board include the Sport England chairman, Nick Bitel, and the former Arsenal managing director Keith Edelman.\n\nOn Thursday another former chair of the LLDC said it may be necessary to forgo the athletics track, the retention of which has been a priority throughout, in order to make the stadium sustainable.\n\n\u201cThe additional costs have come from the removal and storage of the seats and the time taken to do that,\u201d Daniel Moylan, a former adviser to Johnson who chaired the LLDC in 2012, told LBC. \u201cThe hard question has to be asked about whether you can continue to use the stadium without demounting them the whole time.\n\n\u201cThat means you wouldn\u2019t have an athletics track but is that the bullet that eventually has to be [bitten]?\u201d\n\nSuch an outcome is highly unlikely however, given that the stadium is hosting the world athletics championships next summer and UK Athletics has a 50-year, legally binding contract for priority use of the stadium throughout July.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec97cf40fb9486339f70605f9e4a02e3eba88962/0_121_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56f4ea3625a1505c0406125af2df045e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec97cf40fb9486339f70605f9e4a02e3eba88962/0_121_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=940c011509be20cd8e7110df2716282c", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Stadium%2CSport+politics%2CSport", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec97cf40fb9486339f70605f9e4a02e3eba88962/0_121_3968_2381/master/3968.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=940c011509be20cd8e7110df2716282c", "date": "03/11/2016"}, "rank_28": {"title": "Why do we expect the Olympics to keep on giving? | David Mitchell", "text": "The Olympics is a puzzling phenomenon. I came to this conclusion reading a news report about the legacy of the 2012 London games. It said there basically wasn\u2019t one. The family gathered nervously to hear the reading of the will only to learn that the bejewelled old dowager had pissed everything away ante-mortem. No urban regeneration for Great Nephew the Lee Valley, no sustained increase in trade for dodgy Uncle Tourism and nothing of any real value for kindly Cousin Shortage of Affordable Housing. No inheritance but debts and a drawer full of useless trinkets (stadiums).\n\nI realise this metaphor is screaming like an Elizabethan Catholic under interrogation, but it wasn\u2019t me who coined the phrase \u201cOlympic legacy\u201d. I just copied it to try and sound modern. That\u2019s what we media types have to do when we enter middle age, as well as pretending we can work our phones and buying fashionable spectacles.\n\nSpeaking of fashionable spectacles, the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Olympics did actually have perceptible legacies, or positive consequences, according to the article I read. They caused happiness spikes in the London population \u2013 so, in bequest terms, more a round of drinks at the wake than the deeds to a Kensington townhouse, but still worth having.\n\nI\u2019m sure we could price up some other stuff: falling in love, having a child, a crisp autumn day, a satisfying fart\n\nAnd with that, I declare the legacy metaphor to have died on the rack without betraying the whereabouts of any fellow Jesuits. And with that, I also announce the passing of the metaphor I\u2019ve been using to refer to the legacy metaphor. It\u2019s been a difficult time and we need to move on.\n\nThese happiness spikes were apparently part of a broader elevation of Londoners\u2019 moods caused by the Olympics. This fact has been established by a team of \u201chappiness researchers\u201d, led by Paul Dolan, professor of behavioural sciences at LSE, and Georgios Kavetsos of Queen Mary University of London. They interviewed 9,000 people in London, Berlin and Paris over a three-year period around the London games in an attempt to measure their sense of wellbeing with and without the Olympian fillip. They found that Londoners became significantly happier from summer/autumn 2012 onwards, though their happiness fell back to normal levels within a year.\n\nThe way the researchers quantified this was interesting. They said the rise in people\u2019s level of satisfaction was equivalent to the mood improvement caused by an \u00a38,000 pay rise. If that\u2019s genuinely true of all 8 million Londoners then the \u00a38.9bn the games cost is quite an inexpensive way of making the city feel like it\u2019s received a \u00a364bn windfall. But the effect is temporary. As Kavetsos put it: \u201cLike any party, you have a great time but the following day you wake up with a hangover.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to the billion dollar question \u2013 or rather the \u00a38.9bn question \u2013 is hosting the Olympics worth it? \u201cIf you want to host a party, host a party and do that. It\u2019s fine,\u201d says Kavetsos. \u201cThe problem with events such as the Olympics is they come with all these claims that they are going to boost jobs and the economy. If you look at the literature, that isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration by David Foldvari.\n\nThis is what puzzled me. Our society, most would agree, does not underrate the importance of money. Money is deemed, usually rightly, to be behind everything, to be insidious and pervasive. Even those who lust after power are suspected of secretly lusting after money more. Money is the ultimate ulterior motive.\n\nYet, according to Kavetsos\u2019s persuasive analysis, where the Olympics is concerned, the situation is reversed. Money isn\u2019t the ulterior motive for hosting the Olympics, it\u2019s the ostensible reason. Money, in the form of economic prosperity and urban regeneration, is what\u2019s set out, front and centre, as why a city should hold the games. The evidence shows, however, that this money, this greater long-term prosperity, hardly ever materialises. But people still want to host the games. What, then, is the ulterior motive?\n\nIt\u2019s partly money too, probably. The Olympics may not make cities wealthier, but any given Olympiad enriches many individuals. A lot of public money always flows into private hands, both legitimately and corruptly. Those people can honestly say \u201cThe Olympics will make us richer\u201d and only have to start lying if pressed for a specific definition of \u201cus\u201d.\n\nBut my hunch is there\u2019s more to it than that. I think a big part of the ulterior motive, the unspoken reason, for wanting to host the games is simply that people really want to host the games. They want to do it because they think it\u2019s exciting and fun and good. But those reasons sound feeble or untrue to cynical contemporary ears. On one level, we think avarice is shameful, but on another, we think it\u2019s the only sensible or believable reason for doing anything. The apparent absence of avarice, we suspect, is just conclusive proof of the lurking presence of sloth, envy and pride.\n\nLondon's Olympic legacy: a suburb on steroids, a cacophony of luxury stumps Read more\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on happiness,\u201d we airily say, but we don\u2019t mean it. We think you can and, in their study, these happiness researchers actually have. A moderate increase in happiness because of a successful civic event is worth eight grand, they say. I\u2019m sure we could get them to price up some other stuff: falling in love, having a child, a crisp autumn day, a satisfying fart. Or, in the debit column, the death of a grandparent, getting beaten up, an awkward silence in a social situation. It could all be expressed in monetary terms.\n\nSince the dawn of time, humans have wanted to quantify things. So we\u2019ve invented hundreds of units of measurement \u2013 kilograms, pints, amps, miles, hours, miles per hour \u2013 but it seems we\u2019re now trying to use currency as the overall measurement, the uber-unit, the way of quantifying the whole human experience.\n\nIt might have been better for Britain if Shakespeare had died poor. The fact that England\u2019s, and the world\u2019s, greatest writer was also financially astute skews how we rate those skills. People mention his business acumen as often as his sonnets. It almost makes us forget that the man\u2019s only genius was for writing. The big house and the second best bed and all that are just antiquarian colour. His affluence adds nothing to his contribution.\n\nWe might be more willing to put money in its place if something as indisputably worthwhile as Shakespeare\u2019s oeuvre hadn\u2019t also turned a financial profit.

Under existing laws, public access to pseudo-public spaces remains at the discretion of landowners who are allowed to draw up their own rules for \u201cacceptable behaviour\u201d on their sites and alter them at will. They are not obliged to make these rules public.\n\nLondoners living in the Stratford area vacated their homes to avoid the crowds \u2013 one Waltham Forest resident house-swapped with someone in the Outer Hebrides \u2013 but many people\u2019s cynicism popped like a balloon during Danny Boyle\u2019s opening ceremony, in which local Bow boy Dizzee Rascal performed Bonkers.\n\nBut the story didn\u2019t end once the Games were finished: the battle for the Olympic legacy is a hard-fought one. The architects and developers want you to know that the area has been revitalised. The housing campaigners want you to know it has largely been revitalised for a new, wealthier demographic. West Ham United plc want you to know the London stadium will make them a top club. West Ham fans want you to know they preferred pie and mash at Upton Park to \u00a36 pints in Hackney Wick. Dizzee is now reading regeneration critiques and preaching about gentrification.\n\nThe organisers\u2019 rhetoric was it was an industrial wasteland where nobody really lived. \u200bBut that\u2019s not true Dr Jonathan Gardner\n\nSo which narrative is correct? The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is managed as a private site by the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), a mayoral development corporation established in 2012, while the former athletes\u2019 village, now known as East Village, contains the pseudo-public spaces Victory Park and Mirabelle Gardens. But is the area a success or failure? And who wins the legacy medal?\n\nAs ever, it depends on who you are \u2013 and whether you see the Olympic Park as \u2026\n\n\u2026 a city from scratch\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Olympic Village under construction in 2009. Photograph: Graeme Robertson\n\nKen Livingstone, then the mayor of London, made it perfectly clear why the Olympics would be a boon. \u201cI didn\u2019t bid for the Olympics because I wanted three weeks of sport,\u201d he said in 2008. \u201cI bid for the Olympics because it\u2019s the only way to get the billions of pounds out of the government to develop the East End \u2013 to clean the soil, put in the infrastructure and build the housing.\u201d\n\nYet it\u2019s easy to forget that what many people talk of as the benefits of the 2012 Games \u2013 new rail links and roads, Westfield shopping centre and the rejuvenation of a brownfield site \u2013 was earmarked to happen anyway, as part of the Stratford City project.\n\nThe original Stratford City project was launched in the late 1990s as a 1.2 million sq metre development, the largest single planning application inside the M25 at the time. It came out of the high-speed rail development to St Pancras that has also led to a regenerated King\u2019s Cross. In 2003, Jason Prior, who led the implementation of the London 2012 Olympic Park, admitted development would have happened even if the Olympics hadn\u2019t come.\n\n\u201cMost people thought we wouldn\u2019t win the bid,\u201d says Jonathan Kendall of Fletcher Priest architects, the designers of the athletes\u2019 village, now known as East Village. \u201cThe benefit of bidding was to galvanise people to think about the area.\u201d This is the genius sleight of hand of the project: the legacy was being implemented already. Fletcher Priest was already designing what became the village and the parkland around. The Olympics just sped up the process: \u201ca rocket booster,\u201d as Kendall puts it.\n\nYou might assume that booster made the planning easier. Not exactly. \u201cThere was a whole pile of money, which meant chunks of Stratford City would get done more quickly,\u201d says Vivienne Ramsey, the head planner. Now retired, she was originally head of development and building control at Newham council, before becoming head of planning at the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) when the bid was won, and finally head of the LLDC when the Games were over. \u201cBut there was then pressure to build what the ODA thought was needed. Although they said they were interested in legacy, their big raison d\u2019etre was the Games.\u201d\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park seen from 3,000ft last year. Photograph: Jason Hawkes/Barcroft Images\n\nThe ODA, she notes, were legally required to build a school and a health centre \u2013 but then went lukewarm. \u201cThe general tenor of the conversation was, \u2018Will you let us off?\u2019\u2013 they only did it because they couldn\u2019t get it out of it.\u201d One big success, she says, was the \u00a310m for training to help locals get the jobs created by Westfield: one of her big \u201cjump up and down moments\u201d was the day the mall opened.\n\nA year ago, Ramsey went for a wander around the East Village residential development. \u201cPeople love living there. They have very tight management system that makes sure the communal areas are kept nice, and security guys who go around all the time to make sure there\u2019s no anti-social behaviour.\u201d She speaks approvingly of a \u201cthree strikes and you\u2019re out\u201d system for policing antisocial behaviour. \u201cThere was only one family that they\u2019d said had to go,\u201d she says, proudly.\n\nCampaigners, however, say the affordable housing targets set for the residential developments in the Olympic Park have been revised down.\n\nIf there\u2019s not enough affordable housing in the area, Ramsey lays the blame at the doors of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair. \u201cSelling council houses doesn\u2019t hack it, because then you don\u2019t replace them. There\u2019s nowhere for people who don\u2019t have much money to buy or rent.\u201d But is it still possible for the Olympic legacy to be part of the solution? \u201cThe government says affordable rent is 80% of market rent, which is too high anyway, so it doesn\u2019t do anything for anybody.\u201d The only solution, she believes, is wholesale political change \u2013 which, after the Grenfell Tower fire, she says just might happen. \u201cI\u2019m watching to see what happens next \u2013 whether they will start letting councils borrow money and build housing again.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest New and oddly placeless \u2026 the East Village in March 2014. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty\n\n\u2026 a place to live\n\n\u201cOur son Jordan was still sharing our room at the age of four so we really needed a bigger place,\u201d says Laura Philbey, 32, who was renting a one-bedroom in Bow with her husband, David, 43, when they saw the East Village social housing properties come up in 2013.\n\nConsent was given to build 2,818 homes before the Games, with 1,379 falling into the \u201caffordable\u201d category. Managed by Triathlon, a partnership between housing associations East Thames and Southern Housing Group and developer First Base, they are comprised of social rent properties that went to people from Newham and other east London boroughs, discount market rent and shared ownership properties. The remaining 1,439 are rented privately by Get Living London, owned by Qatari Diar, clients of Delancey and the Dutch pension fund asset manager, APG.\n\nThe Philbeys were one of the first residents to move into Ursa Mansions, just before Christmas. \u201cAt first it was quiet, but things have picked up,\u201d says Philbey. \u201cIt feels like its own community, everyone is very friendly. Although you are still living in London, it feels like you are not. There are green areas where I take the kids to run around. Westfield is on your doorstep, there\u2019s the health centre, and central London is only 15 or 20 minutes by train.\u201d\n\nFor socialising, they go to the bars the Neighbourhood or Tina We Salute You. They recently caught the men\u2019s hockey world league \u2013 residents get free tickets to sports events and a discount at the local Holiday Inn bar, restaurant and beauty salon, where Philbey gets her nails done. She loves the mix of social and private housing. \u201cIt\u2019s a real diverse group of people. A lot of families with children. Quite a lot of young people but there are some old people, too.\u201d She also likes the gated communal gardens as she feels her children are safe. \u201cMy oldest son goes up to his friend\u2019s house to play there with his friends.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Apartments near the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Photograph: Benjamin Graham/Barcroft Images\n\nThe \u201cvillage\u201d still feels new, and oddly placeless \u2013 you could be in any new development in Melbourne or Lyon \u2013 with streets names like Olympic Park Avenue, Champions Way and Victory Square carrying an air of empty bombast. Because the area is privately owned, you can\u2019t sleep rough on any of the streets, or set up a camera on a tripod without permission. Security guards patrol the area. They reassure Philbey. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would let an eight-year-old play out without there being gated gardens or security,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear as much noise or police cars here as you did in Bow. You do feel safer. \u201d\n\n\n\nSiobhan Best and her partner Jed see things a bit differently. They moved to the East Village in July 2014: \u201cI got pregnant and our flat in Dalston was infested with cockroaches, mice and was totally baby unfriendly,\u201d she says. Although the rent of their Mirabelle Gardens property \u2013 \u00a31,733 for a two-bed from GLL \u2013 was not cheap, the flats were brand new, with nice furniture, gleaming appliances, free internet and Sky TV.\n\nBest found the emptiness and the fact there were security guards patrolling \u201ca bit spooky sometimes\u201d but says the flats were lovely inside, spacious and with a balcony. Yet there were niggles. You had to use the utility company provided for heating, which meant that you couldn\u2019t look for a competitive price, and bills were expensive. With Jed working, Best got lonely. \u201cIt was fine living there while working and pregnant but soon after having my daughter I felt very isolated. The local baby groups in Leyton and Stratford that I was attending closed down due to [a lack of] funding. It was really weird how a new town had been plonked in such a run down area with such poverty, something seemed very odd about the whole place.\u201d The family moved to Essex in 2015.\n\n\u2026 a place to be evicted from\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Clays Lane \u2013 the largest residential co-operative of its kind in Europe until its demolition in 2007. Photograph: Jonathan Banks/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nClays Lane was the largest residential co-operative of its kind in Europe, housing 450 tenants. Julian Cheyne lived there from 1991 until it was compulsorily purchased and demolished for the Games in 2007. He and his neighbours had become accustomed to threats. \u201cThe weekend after I moved into Clays Lane in 1991, a plan came through the letterbox which said it was going to be demolished. There were always people coming up with plans on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nWhen the first diagrams for Stratford City were released in the late 90s, they initially didn\u2019t include plans to destroy Clays Lane. \u201cThey\u2019d have had to knock down two estates and invest quite a lot of money. I think they would have decided there was very little point. The Olympics changed that.\u201d Peabody Homes acquired it in 2005, and it was demolished in 2007.\n\nKestrels used to look down from our two tower blocks. They like semi-maintained areas that don't have many people Julian Cheyne of the Clays Lane estate\n\nCheyne already had passing interest in housing but the events at Clays Lane radicalised him in a sense. In 2006 he co-founded the blog Games Monitor to \u201cdebunk myths\u201d surrounding not just London 2012 but the Olympic project in general. \u201cThe area for the Olympic Park was dismissed as an \u2018urban desert\u2019 by the ODA,\u201d says Cheyne. \u201cOn the LLDC website now it says the site was a hive of activity and innovation \u2013 a really important industrial area. They are just liars.\u201d\n\nIt was easy to ridicule Clays Lane. The area had a traveller site, and sat atop a hill made of reclaimed landfill. Photographs depicted unfashionable residents, chemical factories, recycling plants and a fridge mountain. But Cheyne sees it differently. \u201cIt could be a beautiful place. Kestrels used to look down from our two tower blocks \u2013 birds that like semi-maintained areas that don\u2019t have many people in them.\u201d\n\nCheyne says residents were misled over money they were entitled to, and charged too much upon leaving. \u201cSome people had \u00a32,000 taken off them. On what grounds? They said \u2018Oh, expenses, we did a service for them\u2019 \u2013 \u00a32,000 worth of services?\u201d He counted about 40 nationalities living at Clays Lane when he was there, including some people with questions around their immigration status. \u201cSome of those guys left the estate thinking they were not entitled to be rehoused. We managed to persuade the tenancy advisers to put out a leaflet, which said these are your rights \u2013 but they never circulated it.\u201d\n\nCheyne and some of his former neighbours had to go into emergency accommodation while waiting to be rehoused. Some residents were moved outside east London: Peabody had properties in Westminster, so some were housed there, where rent was a lot more expensive. Cheyne was rehoused in east London but says his rent is more than double what it was in Clays Lane.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A render of Stratford Waterfront, part of the park\u2019s new Cultural and Education District. Photograph: Forbes Massie\n\n\u2026 an archaeological site\n\n\n\nOf course, five years is a drop in the bucket of the history of this area \u2013 and Dr Jonathan Gardner of University College London was one of 100 archeologists drafted in to dig under the sites of what would become Zaha Hadid\u2019s aquatics centre and the \u201cPringle\u201d velodrome. They dug 120 small trenches, and crouched in the mud through one of the coldest winters for years, in order to find excavations ranging from a Bronze Age skeleton to an 18th century boat. \u201c[In the Bronze Age] it was a completely different landscape, very marshy, very low-lying,\u201d Gardner says. \u201cA lot more rivers.\u201d\n\nThe ODA was legally required to get planning permission and to record the archaeology of the site. Only around 1% of the park was excavated, but near the Velodrome they found an entire Victorian cobbled street and the ruins of several cottages, buried under 1940s and 1950s landfill. The site was heavily contaminated with chemical waste, from its industrial heyday, so Gardner wore a protective suit.\n\nAlthough the Olympics reshaped the landscape, the hills now enjoyed by residents and visitors are still sculpted landfill \u2013 shaped and moulded and sealed off, to protect a clean layer of topsoil for plants. Gardner wonders about how his role gives legitimacy to events such as the Olympics. \u201cQuite often, they can have negative effects on the past: they wipe out historic districts, housing, jobs, rivers, roads,\u201d he says. \u201cThe organisers\u2019 rhetoric was it was an industrial wasteland where nobody really lived. But that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Roman coin from the period of Emperor Constantine II (AD 330-335) was unearthed at the Olympic construction site in 2007.

The estate is still standing, for now.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The main Olympic arena is now West Ham\u2019s home ground. On the left is Orbit, a 114.5m sculpture by Anish Kapoor, with a slide by artist Carsten H\u00f6ller. Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian\n\n\u2026 or as a \u2018destination\u2019\n\nAs a new piece of city, the Olympic Park isn\u2019t radical. But neither is it the forlorn and barren white elephant many suggested it might become. No one would describe the odd situation of tens of thousands West Ham fans being herded away from the shopping hordes at Westfield, or the park\u2019s stop-start cycle lanes, as functional. But the place does, in its way, function. People live there, but many, many more people visit \u2013 and enjoy it.\n\nOne Leyton resident says the park space was a godsend when he was on paternity leave. \u201cIt meant I could go on a two-hour walk, feed my son in the park, there was space to move and it was easy to push a buggy around or for him to walk.\u201d What of the criticism that the development feels alien to the surrounding area? \u201cI disagree. The first year that it opened it felt unimpressive \u2013 the trees had just been planted, it was quite bare and scrappy and there was a lot of building work \u2013 but year on year, as the park beds in naturally, it is getting better. People go to the pool, the Copper Box gym, the velodrome and other facilities for recreation. It feels to me that it\u2019s used.\u201d\n\nWalking round the place as a visitor can feel a little like traversing a theme park with people living in it. Playful ways of marking territory such as #MyE20 appear emblazoned on hills or in a pond; a deeply strange hunk of twisted steel from the World Trade Centre in the car park of the aquatics centre typifies the grandstanding absurdity of parts of this place, but there are more buildings still to come: residential, cultural, recreational. Again, it\u2019s a mixed bag.\n\nRevealed: the insidious creep of pseudo-public space in London Read more\n\n\u201cMuch of what\u2019s been done is quite good,\u201d says Simon Munk, a cycling campaigner who lives in Walthamstow. \u201cBut you only need to ride there for five minutes and you can see bad surfaces, cycle tracks that stop and start, tracks that come to junctions that are not suitable for cycling. It\u2019s a 1980s approach, with no coherence.\u201d\n\nThere are plans to demolish some artist space in Hackney Wick for a new walking and cycling bridge, which Munk says cyclists don\u2019t actually need, and a new road and car bridge. The upshot will be new routes for drivers coming from the Blackwall Tunnel, creating huge rat runs through the park \u2013 not exactly a vision of a less car-reliant future. One of the park\u2019s ironies is that there used to be two cycle tracks between the velodrome and the Clays Lane site \u2013 a race track, the Eastway, and an off-road track, the Beastway \u2013 that were lost during the landscaping and repurposing (although a new facility was built at Hog Hill in Redbridge). Munk says the Eastway cycle track is a good example of undervaluing community assets that aren\u2019t on the radar of outsiders. \u201cPoliticians saw it as a lawless place, but it was a rich seam of London lore and life.\u201d\n\nSome of the Olympic Park is already threatening to fray here and there; yet it still gives off an air of abnormal newness: impersonal but with free wifi. From the comfortable charity coffee shop to the private security guards ushering you this way or that when events are on, the managed nature of the place seems to be its defining legacy.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3 August 2017.

The current publicly owned operator, E20, is losing \u00a310-\u00a320m a year, the report stated \u2013 including losing \u00a32.25m hosting West Ham to play football, which costs \u00a34.75m a season.\n\nNewham borough council, which loaned \u00a340m towards the conversion of the stadium for West Ham, has accepted it will not see that money repaid and has withdrawn from the E20 partnership. Khan announced that he, through the mayoral body the London Legacy Development Corporation, will take control of the stadium and seek to staunch its losses.\n\n\u201cWhat has been presented is simply staggering,\u201d Khan said, in scathing criticisms of Johnson. \u201cNot for the first time, it reveals a bungled decision-making process that has the previous mayor\u2019s fingerprints all over it.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson clearly panicked when faced with legal challenges about West Ham and Newham\u2019s joint bid to take ownership of the stadium and then decided to rerun the bid process with the taxpayer taking all the risks and footing almost the whole bill. You simply couldn\u2019t make it up. The fact he also failed to properly examine the transformation costs or the entirely inadequate estimates for moving the retractable seats leaves us squarely in the dire financial situation we are in.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sadiq Khan said: \u2018Boris Johnson clearly panicked when faced with legal challenges about West Ham and Newham\u2019s joint bid to take ownership of the stadium.\u2019 Photograph: Johnny Armstead/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe Moore Stephens review traces the history of the project from when London was granted the right in 2005 to host the Olympics, to the \u00a3752m total cost of the stadium and continuing losses. Originally in 2006, the Olympic Delivery Authority did not want to hand an expensively built public asset to a Premier League club, so commissioned a design for temporary seating to come down after the games, leaving a 25,000-seat stadium with an athletics track.\n\nJohnson, who succeeded Ken Livingstone as the mayor in 2008, decided the reduced stadium plan was not a prestigious enough legacy and would cost public money to maintain, so scrapped it and the Olympic Park Legacy Company ran a competitive bid for its future use. Moore Stephens found that a proposal by Tottenham Hotspur to demolish the stadium and build a new one was quite sound, but was deemed unacceptable because the stadium post-Games was considered \u201can iconic venue\u201d which should not be knocked down. Spurs\u2019 proposed cost of \u00a3323m was to be met by the club commercially borrowing, naming rights and \u00a335m public money. West Ham, then seeking \u00a375m public money towards a \u00a395m proposal for the stadium to have 60,000 seats and keep the running track permanently, were chosen. The club, not the public sector bodies, was to be responsible for the maintenance, development and operational costs.\n\nThat solution was scrapped completely after the decision was subjected to legal challenges, and a new bidding process was held in 2011. Moore Stephens identify as a crucial and costly change the decision then for the public sector bodies to take on the risk and costs of operating the stadium, charging West Ham only rent.\n\nSpurs did not bid, Johnson having committed funding to helping the club redevelop at White Hart Lane, and the review says this left West Ham in a very strong negotiating position in \u201ca very short list\u201d of possible solutions. The review says Johnson should have used \u201cno deal\u201d as a negotiating tactic and reverted to the previous design, but he and the LLDC did not.\n\nWest Ham\u2019s revised bid sought a much greater contribution of public money, now for retractable seating over the running track, which also meant the roof would have to be extended to cover those seats. The cost was projected by the LLDC, chaired by Johnson from September 2012 \u2013 the same figure as Spurs\u2019 original proposal. West Ham\u2019s contribution to the conversion remained at the level for the previous bid with the track retained permanently, just \u00a315m; the LLDC paid \u00a3187.8m towards it; \u00a3291.5m in total came from public money. Johnson said at the time: \u201cIt is vital that I continue to be at the forefront of the decision-making, driving forward the huge task of delivery.\u201d\n\nThe review criticises the deal as \u201cnot good\u201d for the public, and finds the LLDC was too optimistic about the money it could make from naming rights and other commercial opportunities. E20\u2019s losses are being borne by the LLDC, Khan said.\n\nWest Ham\u2019s Olympic Stadium deal explained: from Water City to the London Stadium Read more\n\nIn response, a spokesman for Johnson did not directly address the criticisms made in the review, but criticised the original decision to have a reduced 25,000-seat solution for the stadium. He defended the decision to scrap the first bid under legal challenges, saying to continue would have led to \u201cyears of delay\u201d. The spokesman also highlighted the legacy, of venues now in the hands of private operators, new housing and football in the stadium, saying: \u201cThe current mayor \u2026 knows no other city has an Olympic legacy like London\u2019s \u2013 and that is down to Boris and his team.\u201d\n\nThe report did not criticise West Ham for seeking the best deal. The club said: \u201cWest Ham United has played a significant part in the most successful regeneration programme in the history of the modern Olympics, however the stadium itself craves renewed leadership and direction and we welcome the mayor\u2019s decision to step in and deliver this.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f573b1aa2463c14c2ba02cb38b4e4788741b35ec/0_287_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4514377b4e2b40dc5a166375ee98908e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f573b1aa2463c14c2ba02cb38b4e4788741b35ec/0_287_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b673cbee36205c92586a05dc8eba4e10", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Olympic+Stadium%2CWest+Ham+United%2CFootball%2CSadiq+Khan%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CSport", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdc48f7c1897ff6708102e2a96a732eed4bbc6d8/701_157_3414_2049/master/3414.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f124e76a0831bb751297c1bf627a407d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f573b1aa2463c14c2ba02cb38b4e4788741b35ec/0_287_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b673cbee36205c92586a05dc8eba4e10", "date": "01/12/2017"}, "rank_34": {"title": "From Olympic Park to East Bank: how St Paul's 'faux pas' led to design rethink", "text": "Plans for a cultural hub at the Olympic park have been relaunched under Sadiq Khan, and include an east London outpost of the V&A. But will it draw the crowds?\n\nTrapped in a purgatory of masterplans, consultations and yet more plans, east London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is no stranger to revisions. Proposals for a \u00a31.3bn cultural hub, announced by former mayor Boris Johnson in 2013 and unveiled in 2016, have just been redesigned, rebranded and relaunched by the current mayor, Sadiq Khan, who, in a moment of deja vu, hailed it on Tuesday as \u201cthe most ambitious new project of its kind for decades\u201d.\n\nFeaturing an outpost of the Victoria and Albert Museum, a Sadler\u2019s Wells dance theatre and a new home for the London College of Fashion, along with residential towers, the park\u2019s planned arts district, once known as Olympicopolis, in tune with Johnson\u2019s penchant for ancient Greek, has been reborn as East Bank, with the addition of a new base for the BBC symphony orchestra and recording studios. It now features four towers rather than two, the V&A has been slashed to a third of its size and what was a parade of dour brick blocks has been jollied up in more expressive clothing.\n\nFrom Doctor Who to Joy Division: five of the greatest Maida Vale recordings Read more\n\nIts architects say it is now a \u201cmore urban\u201d place, a \u201cpiece of city\u201d to line the edge of the park rather than a row of individual buildings. It does indeed look like care has been taken with thresholds, undercrofts and open edges that will \u201cenable people to be \u2018within\u2019 the buildings without actually entering them\u201d. But why the total rethink?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Map of the planned East Bank development.\n\nSuccessive mayors always want to make their mark, but the main reason for the redesign \u2013 which entailed starting from scratch, with a revised budget of \u00a31.1bn \u2013 is to be found more than 12 miles west, thanks to a baroque quirk of London\u2019s planning system.\n\nThe parkgoers of leafy Richmond might not know their power, but they have been bestowed with the sacred right to an unencumbered view of the dome of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, nine miles away, behind which the 47-storey twin towers of the original Olympicopolis plan would have poked up when viewed through a telescope mounted in Richmond park for the purpose. The breach of the protected view was only discovered when the cheeky concrete shaft of one of Stratford\u2019s other towers, Manhattan Loft Gardens, appeared on the skyline at the end of 2016, leering like a middle finger behind St Paul\u2019s, to the horror of conservationists with telephoto lenses.\n\nDespite the view already being despoiled, the London Legacy Development Corporation decided to chop its blocks in half in deference to the protected prospect, making four towers of 23 storeys. As a result, the neighbouring cultural and educational buildings have been forced to shrink and must now huddle together at the end of the site, as if retreating from the incessant march of luxury flats. But are there improvements in the redesign?\n\n\u201cMoving the buildings closer together has created a more dynamic place,\u201d argues architect John Tuomey, one half of the celebrated Dublin practice O\u2019Donnell + Tuomey (ODT), which won the competition to design the cultural quarter in 2015, with Allies and Morrison and Spanish practice Arquitecturia. Bob Allies agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s a tougher, richer, more interesting project. And those 40-odd-storey towers did seem a bit weird.\u201d\n\nWhen the first scheme was unveiled, it was criticised in some quarters as a missed opportunity. \u201cDull as ditchwater,\u201d was Will Alsop\u2019s verdict, while Peter Cook compared it to the kind of \u201cunder-amplified Vivaldi \u2026 fed to you in a gift shop\u201d. It was deemed too square and too beige. The pressure to perform has led the architects to indulge in a wider variety of shapes and materials, some of which is welcome, but it feels a little contrived when squeezed on to the newly reduced site, as if trying too hard to give each institution its own identity. After public consultations and multi-headed client input, the result is design by committee.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artist\u2019s impression of the planned new V&A.\n\nThe V&A, once the star of the show, now looks like a dinky trinket, sandwiched between the bulky fashion college and the blocks of flats. Designed by ODT, it has gone from a shifting stack of brick blocks to a faceted concrete pavilion, with the air of an angular octopus standing on tiptoes. Squeezed for space, its open archive will be relocated across the park in the former Olympic broadcasting centre, reborn as Here East, in a space designed by New York firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro. It has freed up ODT\u2019s building to be pure galleries, wrapped in a pleated concrete skin, where a meandering staircase will take visitors on an intriguing journey up to a roof terrace, with echoes of the architect\u2019s magical brick ziggurat for the London School of Economics. It is small, but potentially perfectly formed.\n\nThe London College of Fashion, by Allies and Morrison, is the same size as before, but has ditched its zigzag brick facade in favour of a simple white concrete frame with big factory windows. The chunky columns form a three-storey colonnade around its base, drawing you into an airy world of high-ceilinged studios and wide staircases. The BBC stands next door, by the same architects, as a polite composition of boxes clad in weathering steel and concrete, containing performance space and recording studios, where free events will take place. The lineup is completed with Sadler\u2019s Wells, designed by ODT as a purplish brick shed containing a 550-seat theatre and dance studios. It\u2019s topped with a sawtooth factory roofline, recalling the industrial history of the site. It is a consciously tough edifice to stand opposite the voluptuous curves of Zaha Hadid\u2019s aquatics centre, and a ground-floor corner will be devoted to a community dance space, providing a shop window of cavorting bodies to lure people inside.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ready to work,\u201d says Sheila O\u2019Donnell. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want the building to feel institutional, but to be a creative place where things are being made.\u201d It is a principle that Allies says has informed the approach across the site. In line with the crafted ethos, the materials will all bear the marks of being cast, whether in brick, concrete or ceramic tile, while Arquitecturia has designed a pleasingly fleshy bridge of sculpted pink concrete and steel. Care has been given to the landscaped podium on which the buildings stand, creating a place of cascading terraces, steps and ramps to bring people down to the water\u2019s edge, where performances and events are planned to animate the space.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Artist\u2019s impression of the planned new Sadler\u2019s Wells theatre.\n\nIn this, the design takes a cue from the multi-levelled terraces of the Southbank Centre, from where East Bank draws inspiration for both its mixed functions and its name. It will have a similar cocktail of retail outlets stuffed into its podium, and there is every chance that some of the 50 million people who flock to Westfield each year might be lured across the bridge to inject some South Bank bustle. While both sites were the legacies of international events \u2013 the 1951 Festival of Britain and the 2012 Olympic Games \u2013 the glaring difference is that East Bank is being conceived in a climate when the sale of private flats is expected to pay for the public bounty; for all the architects\u2019 best intentions, the apartment-to-culture ratio feels painfully imbalanced.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae3326a62dcc456e6d85805cedc2cc2bd3ce9484/0_194_3370_2190/master/3370.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c2c8edb7d2d07a3153298e259843177", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15374c90d2cb1fb2df2438162f1aac7db4bf0850/0_555_4949_5401/master/4949.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d18ac7a6e6ca7800faf3eb9ce9a2f6c3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e23628a0258f2cabba07ec248cc4c6a102a62e/2769_0_4343_2608/master/4343.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8bc51cfa9588878450ecb81856eb62c1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e23628a0258f2cabba07ec248cc4c6a102a62e/2769_0_4343_2608/master/4343.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a744c6cf055723d66352e80f09264ab7", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&comscorekw=Architecture%2CArt+and+design%2CCulture%2COlympic+Games+2012%2COlympic+legacy%2CUK+news%2CLondon%2CSadiq+Khan%2COlympic+Games", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dbca0718a94ded4d4c9e569921de551445a4eb7/0_2585_4695_3927/master/4695.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9f439442e893a0a3ab942a228e7eba7"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2e23628a0258f2cabba07ec248cc4c6a102a62e/2769_0_4343_2608/master/4343.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a744c6cf055723d66352e80f09264ab7", "date": "05/06/2018"}, "rank_164": {"title": "What makes London 2012 the 'dirtiest ever' Olympic Games? \u2013 video explainer", "text": "There have now been 116 failed drug tests from London 2012 \u2013 an Olympic record, and with the IOC keeping samples from the Games for another three years that figure could still rise.\n\nOrganisers say they want to conduct retests on athletes\u2019 samples and benefit from advances in technology to catch drug cheats.
