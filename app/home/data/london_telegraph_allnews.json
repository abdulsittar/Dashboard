{"rank_250": {"title": "London bid another step forward", "text": "Sport in this country has come a long way since hilarity was the loudest response to the idea of a London Olympic bid. In those early days, people imagined one long fiasco of missed deadlines and signal failures on the tube. The Games would suffer death by committee, death by engineering works. Non-believers cried: \" Look at the Dome, look at Wembley, look at us! \" Were the British not the gold medallists in chaos?\n\nThis black comedy of self-deprecation had its uses. It gave London a reason to look into the cracked mirror of the Thames. Like America these past 25 years, Britain has tended to put private consumption before public investment. This has turned us into a nation which drinks caffe lattes and eats rocket salads but can't get to work on time because of the trains. Health, education, transport: these are the three great anxieties of modern British life. So along comes a proposal for a London Olympic bid and we all have to decide what we think: not about the Games so much as our capital city - our deepening culture of self-doubt.\n\nThe best bet was to keep it simple. Would London be a better or worse place to live after the Olympic circus had left town? The city's mayor, Ken Livingstone, was the most impressive performer at yesterday's official announcement. He preached the gospel of regeneration. \"Not since Queen Victoria was on the throne will a single decision have had such an effect on London,\" he said while assuring ratepayers that he would play to win.\n\nIt ought to be obvious that the crew on British sport's old ship of fools should be kept away from the delicate bidding process. This is not another free ride for the gin and tonic brigade. The best sporting administrators should be led to the fore and the worst told to spend more time at the allotment. Internationally, the 2006 World Cup bid showed the Football Association (and by implication the English) to be hopelessly misguided in their belief that votes could be won by parading Sir Bobby Charlton around the world.\n\nThe more the FA rammed tradition down the world game's throat the more it gagged. So the best foundation for London's Olympic campaign is not the old mother country rhetoric but humility: an acceptance that London needs the Games more than the Games need London. Bringing them to this country will leave an infrastructure legacy to compare with the advances made in Barcelona, Sydney and Athens.\n\nLondon is routinely referred to as one of the world's great cities, which it is. More accurately, though, it's a mosaic of small towns rammed together into a steaming, slow-moving metropolis of abundant creativity and energy but no real civic sense. By 2012, at both extremes of the District Line, Londoners may have discovered a new reason to regard each other as neighbours and participants in a single, consuming urban drama. They will pay for it, sure, but there may be a fresh light in London's eye, a better appreciation of what the city is capable of beyond the old imperatives of getting and spending.\n\nThe objections that were raised like street barricades by the antis have been crushed. The first was that it's immoral to spend \u00a32.6 billion of public money on a three-week fiesta when the Government are still acquiescing in the sale of school playing fields and under-investing in physical education. That needed to be said. But this was never an either/or scenario. It's not as if those billions were piled high on a Westminster table and the Cabinet had to decide whether to spend them on athletic equipment in London comprehensives or splurge it all on one of the two biggest shows on earth (the other one being football's World Cup).\n\nAnother firm protestation was that we shouldn't need the Games to sort out our tube network, the East End and our dismal tradition of leaving health-improving sports to their own devices. Who could argue against such moral logic? Never mind the A-Z. Some days in London you're doing well if you get from A to B. The hard truth, though, is that governments achieve change quicker when they have an imposed timetable or an excuse. There is no greater incentive for a politician than protecting his place in history. Perversely, the Tony Blair-Jacques Chirac rivalry is good news for the organisers of London's bid. It keeps No 10's mind on the job.\n\nThe sporting argument is strong, but nothing persuades quite like the possibility that London will advance 40 years in 10, and achieve in seven years of frantic investment a better balance between East and West. Better trains, more venues and facilities - the long-term benefit of which must be universal access - moisture for the grass roots. One only has to step off the rattler at Manchester's Piccadilly station to appreciate the effect of last summer's Commonwealth Games. Aside from the new stadiums and the new look for Piccadilly Gardens, there is a noticeable increase in Manchester's confidence, its self-esteem.\n\nIronically, it was Manchester which played the victim in Britain's last, and almost entirely shambolic, Olympic bid, almost a decade ago. Sydney blew them away. But we've come a long way since a senior British Olympic administrator suggested an athletes' village could be built under canvas in Hyde Park - a kind of Glastonbury of wrestlers and javelin throwers.\n\nWe can throw all sorts of abstractions around: unity, strong leadership, vision. But what will really bring the Games to London is clever horse-trading among the 127 International Olympic Committee members whose votes will determine the venue for 2012. Rhetoric and grand plans for the East End will not by themselves turn heads. Sad this, but persuasion is the cold reality of the piano bar in the five-star hotel.\n\nToday, and for one day only, the architects of the bid can reflect on how far New Labour thinking has come since the House of Commons listlessly debated the British Olympic Association's proposal. Yesterday Tessa Jowell, Secretary of State at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, went through an astonishing conversion. She promised that the Games \"will put sport - from the school-yard to the medal podium - at the heart of government thinking.\" We should hold her to that.", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "date": "16/05/2003"}, "rank_236": {"title": "London's Valley of hope", "text": "With an 80,000 capacity stadium as its centrepiece and a promise not to include any white elephant developments, the London bid for the 2012 Olympics finally took shape yesterday.\n\nPlans unveiled by the bid team show how 14 of the 35 sports will be located in a 500-acre Olympic zone contained within 1,500 acres of the Lower Lea Valley.\n\nFrom Hackney Marshes in the north to the River Thames in the south, the regeneration of this part of London will mark the biggest urban park development seen in Europe for 200 years.\n\nThe Olympics will also mean that the redevelopment already planned for this part of London could take just eight years instead of 20.\n\nThe bid may have been slow to start but six months' work has gone into a plan of the Olympic park and sporting venues that will be presented to East End communities at a series of public meetings over the next two weeks.\n\nOn the face of it, the 2012 team have come up with something none of the other bidding cities can match: a compact Olympic site offering half of the athletes taking part only a 15-minute journey to their events.\n\nKeith Mills, the chief executive of London 2012, said: \"The plan shows our preferred options for the Olympic bid but with the public consultation process starting this week, nothing is set in stone.\"\n\nThe Olympic zone, lying between the boroughs of Hackney, Waltham Forest, Tower Hamlets and Newham, contains the BMX cycling courses and velodrome, indoor arenas for basketball, volleyball and handball, the aquatic centre for swimming and diving and the Olympic stadium itself.\n\nThere will be an all-weather tennis centre and hockey pitches and, within walking distance, an athletes' village of 5,000 houses with 17,000 beds, together with the media and broadcast centres.\n\nThe redevelopment of one of London's most neglected areas will also involve the reclaiming of the River Lea and a co-ordinated network of roads to offer a picturesque and practical route through the Olympic venues.\n\nRunning through the middle of the Olympic zone will be a public plaza.\n\nThe London Development Agency, who are providing \u00a315 million for the bid and underwriting the Games by up to \u00a3250 million, claim they will have acquired more than 50 per cent of the land by the time the capital's detailed bid plans are submitted to the International Olympic Committee in November 2004.\n\nEven London's biggest bugbear, transport, appears to have been solved. The new international rail station at Stratford will be the principal hub while the main A12 and A13 roads will offer fast lanes into the centre of London.\n\nMindful of the IOC's growing obsession with the Olympic legacy, however, the London 2012 team have concentrated on what will be left once the Games have left town.\n\n\"We're committed to a legacy that will ensure that no venues are built without a clear plan for their post-Games use,\" said Mills. \"There will be no white elephants at the London Games. We'll build what we need and no more.\"\n\nThe cycling facilities, aquatic centre and buildings used for the media centres will stay and the athletes' village will provide the housing stock so prized by Ken Livingstone and the Greater London Authority.\n\nThe major concern about the legacy left by the Games, however, will come with the stadium which will be, according to the plan, in Marshgate Lane.\n\nFuture plans for an almost new stadium with one careful owner remain unclear but those London football clubs looking for new homes provide several likely options.\n\n\"We are determined to show the IOC that we won't be left with something like the Homebush Stadium in Sydney,\" Mills said.\n\n\"There are various options on the table, including providing a new home for a London football club. But whatever is built there has to be economically viable and something the local community will sustain and support.\"\n\nThe IOC will announce their choice of the host city for the 2012 Olympics in July 2005.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00748/sport-graphics-2003_748080a.gif", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "date": "12/11/2003"}, "rank_228": {"title": "How an old people's home can bring London's dream to reality", "text": "If the Olympic evaluation commission were looking for the best examples of passion on their visit to London's venues yesterday, they came from an American and a Scotsman.\n\nTim Leiweke, the president and chief executive of the United States-based Anschutz Entertainment Group, impressed upon them how the Dome, once Britain's finest white elephant, was about to burst into life again with a 26,000-seat arena able to stage basketball and gymnastics. Leiweke, whose company were spending some \u00a3166 million on reinvigorating one of the capital's wasted wonders, said: \"We are a US company helping London win the bid. That is very significant.\"\n\nSir Robin Wales, the mayor of Newham, explained how aspiration and the legacy of a London Olympics were firing up the good folk of Stratford as the bulldozers laid waste their corner of East London.\n\nIt was rousing stuff that could not have failed to impress Nawal El Moutawakel and her team of inspectors, in London to assess the capital's bid for the 2012 Olympics.\n\nIt was a day for El Moutawakel's commissioners to see if the reality matched the claims made in the 23-themed candidature file submitted by London to the International Olympic Committee in November.\n\nWhat they saw was a city at work and eager to impress. The London 2012 banners were everywhere as they made their early-morning foray from their five-star Docklands hotel into the drab landscape of one of Europe's most socially deprived areas.\n\nFirst stop for the IOC coach was Holden Point, a 22-storey, old people's home in Stratford, hardly the location they might have imagined for the best view of London's Olympic dream.\n\nBut it was from a prefabricated building specially erected on the roof of this building that they saw the focus of London's bid.\n\nStretching out beneath them and dominated by the mountains of mud surrounding Stratford's new international railway station was the proposed site of the Olympic Park.\n\nBrightly coloured blimps marked where the park's sporting venues would be built. In the distance, they could see where the 80,000 seat Olympic stadium would be and where the world's media would report the Games. Later some computer-generated sequences illustrated how the building site before them would be transformed into the biggest new area of urban parkland in Europe, linked to central London by bullet trains taking only seven minutes to make the journey from Stratford to King's Cross.\n\nThe planning applications were in place, agreements made and the regeneration of Stratford would proceed, irrespective of the Olympic bid's success or failure.\n\nAmid all the talk of grand schemes, the common touch came from Sir Robin, the Scotsman originally from Kilmarnock, who told the IOC inspectors of the latest example of London's Olympic legacy.\n\nSir Robin said: \"This is a nice wee example of legacy, built for you to look out at the fabulous mounds of mud.\"\n\nHe explained that the prefabricated building erected to protect the IOC commissioners from the worst of the winter winds would be left for Holden Point's residents to enjoy.\n\nFrom there, Nawal and her team were taken past the Railway Tavern and the gardens of Waddington Road to a clearing in the building site and a small white marquee put up for their convenience.\n\nEven El Moutawakel would have smiled at the incongruity of it all. Here in the tent, she listened to more presentations on how life would be in the Olympic Park of 2012.\n\nIf the IOC team needed more reality, it came with their 15-minute journey by Land Rover through the 4.7 mile tunnel from Stratford to King's Cross.\n\nStill two years away from carrying high-speed trains, the $5 billion Channel Tunnel rail link would be used to whisk 24,000 passengers an hour from central London to the Olympic Park.", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "date": "18/02/2005"}, "rank_196": {"title": "Coe insists London legacy is secure", "text": "Lord Coe, the chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, was at his diplomatic best yesterday in putting the Central Council for Physical Recreation in their place over the city's Olympic legacy.\n\nSpeaking at the 34th CCPR national conference, where the theme was \"2012 - more than just medals\", Coe assured his audience of officials, administrators and local authority representatives that the legacy of the London Olympics was in good hands.\n\nThe CCPR, a lobbying group established in 1935 who represent 270 sporting bodies and 150,000 clubs with 13 million members, had warned that plans to create a legacy of participation were in danger of falling behind schedule.\n\nTim Lamb, the CCPR's chief executive, said: \"We want to see one organisation being given responsibility for delivering a legacy of physical activity from the Games throughout the UK.\n\n\"As things stand, there's no single body which can be held to account for this kind of legacy issue and that's something that could cause problems down the line.\"\n\nIn his 30-minute speech, however, Coe outlined a raft of programmes already in place, designed to increase awareness of the Games and participation in sport.

King Sturge reveals that many districts close to the Olympic Park \u2013 with the notable exception of Stratford itself \u2013 have already seen 10 per cent house price growth since the 2005 winning bid announcement, but remain at a discount to average London house prices.\n\nDr Angus McIntosh, King Sturge's research partner, says that a combination of transport improvements and the \"Olympic effect\" are likely to boost the local market before 2012. \"But that's the issue,' he says. \"When all the crowds have gone, what are you left with?\"\n\nKing Sturge's main concern revolves around the glut of housing planned for the Lower Lea Valley \u2013 40,000 new homes over the next 20 years \u2013 underpinning in principle the Government's aim to make the wider Thames Gateway one of its key growth areas. McIntosh says: \"At the moment there's a lot of discussion about the [Olympic] construction programme being over budget, but we haven't found any clear vision of what legal or political structure will be in place in the future.\n\n\"You think of thousands of new homes, the parkland, the schools, the doctors' surgeries, all the bits that make sustainable urban development. Who is going to manage and maintain it? Who are the asset managers, not in 2012 but 2022?\"\n\nThe Olympic Park site alone will accommodate 9,000 permanent homes, half of which will be redeveloped from the athletes' village by property giant Lend Lease and its housebuilding partner First Base.\n\nLend Lease and First Base want to turn the athletes' village into Britain's first \u00a31bn residential real estate investment trust, banking on the idea that more Londoners will be prepared to rent property as London's housing shortfall and affordability crisis worsens.\n\nRichard Powell, a director of First Base, says: \"One of the primary reasons for the residential fund is that you have a single management entity. Over time that will allow us to sell chunks of stock but not flood the market. It's in our control.\"\n\nBut there is no such control beyond the village site, which is why there are concerns that the huge house-building programme could destabilise the market around Stratford, even allowing for London's overall imbalance between supply and demand. One of East London's biggest house-builders is Oracle Group, which is active everywhere except Stratford.\n\nChairman David Burke says: \"One of the things we're keen to see is more of a plan for how the homes are going to be released after the Olympics.\" He added: \"It's important to get good community spirit in a regeneration area and if they are all dumped on the market at the same time you're going to struggle to create any community spirit because you'll have lots of houses empty.\"\n\nThe London Development Agency (LDA) aims to address such concerns with an \"Olympic legacy master plan\", which will cover the new housing and related infrastructure and services in the Lower Lea Valley.\n\nThis week the LDA announced a short-list of private sector groups bidding for the chance to draw up the master plan. It will form the basis of an outline planning application in 2009 and provide the \"context\" for all development after 2012.\n\nThe LDA will regain control of the Olympic Park once the games are over but in its report, King Sturge recommends that a long-term trust or urban corporation be created immediately to co-ordinate the long-term sustainability of all the development sites.\n\nKing Sturge suggests there are salutary lessons to be learned from under-used former Olympic villages in Barcelona and Sydney. According to its report, there are concerns even now that these developments \"can suffer social problems and isolation\" rather than integration into the local communities. Athens, at least initially, was the worst of the lot, McIntosh says: \"A full 12 months after the Olympic Games all the houses were empty.\"\n\nConstruction matters\n\nCompany set to build stadium has 'fantastic track record' reports Doug Morrison\n\nJohn Armitt, the new chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), last week played down fears over the tender process and escalating costs.\n\nThe ODA is expected to unveil detailed designs of the Olympic stadium and sign off a final contract with the main builder, Team McAlpine, in the next few weeks. There have been concerns that the ODA would struggle to get value for money because Team McAlpine was the only bidder for the contract, even though the group has won plaudits for its work on Arsenal\u2019s Emirates stadium.\n\nBut Armitt told The Daily Telegraph: \"We\u2019re getting a team with a fantastic track record. Very often in construction you don\u2019t get continuity. We\u2019re getting that with the main stadium.\"\n\nArmitt, who joined the ODA from Network Rail in September, also dismissed similar concerns over the aquatics centre after German firm Hochtief and French group Eifel withdrew from the tender process, leaving Balfour Beatty as the only bidder.\n\n\"Two have pulled out but we\u2019re quite happy with Balfour Beatty. We can now finish this with Balfour \u2013 it is one of the biggest contractors in the UK,\" said Armitt.\n\nA final budget for the aquatics centre has yet to be agreed. He dismissed the idea that some contractors might regard London 2012 as a poisoned chalice, pointing out that there are multiple bidders on the other arenas and facilities.\n\n\"We\u2019re quite optimistic,\" he said. Armitt was speaking after a forum in Stratford where members of the public quizzed the Olympic organisers over preparations for the Games.

We'll be happy to work with anyone he appoints to have a look at them.\"\n\nWhile arguments continue about the cost of the Games, the rapid pace of construction work is likely to receive a glowing report from the IOC.\n\nOn Thursday, the inspection team will be taken to the Olympic Park in Stratford, where a ground-breaking ceremony will mark the start of construction of the main Olympic stadium - three months ahead of schedule.\n\nWork on the aquatics centre will begin in the summer while contracts have recently been signed to build the velodrome, though negotiations with developers are still continuing over the other two main building projects on the Olympic Park site - the media and broadcast centre and the athletes' village.\n\nDuring their visit, the IOC are expected to rubber-stamp a proposal to switch the fencing venue from the Olympic Park to the ExCel Centre and to move basketball to the original fencing venue in the northern part of the Stratford site.\n\n\"We will be giving the IOC an upbeat message,\" Armitt said. \"In sporting terms, what we'll be saying is the first lap has gone well but we are now into the long back stretch.\n\n\"The next couple of years, when the bulk of the construction activity will be taking place, are going to be a major challenge.

much cash is being diverted to fund training for Britain's elite athletes, critics claim. The result is that the majority of the population, who enjoy physical activity but can never hope, or don't have the desire, to win awards, are losing out.\n\nOlympic success has left many youngsters clamouring to join sports clubs \u2013 but the clubs are short of funds and are having to close the door on sporting hopefuls. It also comes in the middle of rising public concerns about the growing levels of obesity among the young.\n\nSo today, as the Olympic mantle is officially passed from China to Great Britain and the nation rightly celebrates the proud achievements of its sporting heroes, community sporting groups were left wondering who would pay for the future training of ordinary Britons who simply enjoy sport and want to play more of it.\n\nWhile funding for the minority of truly talented athletes has increased significantly, grassroots sporting organisations say their cash injections have been meagre and fall far short of the sums needed not just to undo years of neglect, but to boost the sports' popularity. The cost of hosting the 2012 Games will only add to the problem, they claim.\n\nAnd the policy, they say, flies in the face of a supposed legacy of the 2012 games: to get more people participating in physical activity.\n\n\"Community sport is now the weak link in the chain,\" Tim Lamb, the chief executive of the Central Council for Physical Recreation, which represents 270 sporting bodies, said last night. \"Unless you develop volunteers and invest in clubs, you can't hope to grow capacity. And capacity is what we will need if we want to deliver an Olympic legacy of increased participation.\"\n\nTo date, tens of millions of pounds has been diverted from grassroots sports to support the costs of the London Olympics. In the past year UK Sport, which funds elite athletes, received \u00a3115.8?million from the Treasury and Lottery, an increase of 230 per cent since 2000. During the same period, funding for Sport England \u2013 and its Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts \u2013 which pays for community sports, has been only \u00a3350?million, a 7 per cent increase.\n\n\"I would love to show someone from the government what it is really like for clubs,\" said Lia Borrotzu, of the Sutton School of Gymnastics, last night. \"We are really, really struggling. Our phones are red hot because of the Olympics but we have to tell parents: 'Sorry, your child can't come.' I have had 13-year-olds on the waiting lists and not been able to get them into the club until they were 18. I am Mrs \u00adDesperate.\"\n\nMiss Borrotzu's plight has been echoed nationwide. Athletics, swimming and gymnastics have all suffered similar shortages of facilities and resources, organisers say, with:\n\nJust one 50m swimming pool for every 2.5 million people in Britain. France, by contrast, has one for every 650,000 of its population;\n\nThe average price of some sports club memberships for children having risen by more than one third in a year;\n\nEight English counties and the entire city of Birmingham doing without a single publicly accessible diving board over a metre high. Thirty years ago England had 298 publicly accessible pools with diving boards. Now there are just 84 in the whole of Britain;\n\nAlmost a quarter of a million aspiring gymnasts now on waiting lists because of insufficient facilities to train them;\n\nOne hundred and eighty-seven school playing fields having been sold off since 1998. Some 19 have gone in the past 18 months.\n\nYet Labour politicians have sought to claim credit for Britain's stirring success in Beijing. Andy Burnham, the Culture Secretary, linked our Olympic triumph directly to Gordon Brown, claiming his decision to put money into the team had resulted in this being Britain's best medal haul for a long time.\n\nAnd last week Richard Caborn, the former sports minister, in an article entitled \"Why Labour can be Proud of the Olympics\", boasted: \"We have put the Great back into Great Britain. The Tories left the most demoralised sporting family you could imagine. Labour turned this around with investment into schools, governing bodies, coaching.\"\n\nBut today Sir John Major, the former Tory prime minister who introduced the National Lottery, which provides money for sports, accuses the government of \"siphoning off funds for their own pet projects\".\n\nWhile applauding our Olympic success, he claimed in The Sunday Telegraph that grassroots schemes have lost about a half a billion pounds to build Olympic venues and other infrastructure. \"A contribution, as with the Commonwealth Games at Manchester, is acceptable but half a billion is far too high a loss for grassroots sports,\" he wrote.\n\nLast night Derek Mapp, the former chairman of Sport England, the organisation which supports community sports, told The Sunday Telegraph: \"If we are really trying to build a sporting nation, and a legacy before and after the 2012 Olympics, then we are going about it in totally the wrong way.\"\n\nMr Mapp left Sport England in November, eight months after \u00a355.9?million of its Lottery funding for 2009 to 2012 was diverted to help cover the cost of the London Olympics venues. This \"cut too far\", he claimed, would in effect remove an extra \u00a3168?million from grassroots sports, because every \u00a31 of Sport England funding attracted \u00a33 of investment from bodies, such as local councils.\n\n\"Anyone who says that more money is going into grassroots sport is plain wrong. It is all very well to invest in UK Sport (which funds elite athletes) to win medals, but we should be aiming for the grassroots \u2013 the 10-year-olds at home watching the Olympics now,\" he said.\n\nCompetitive sport? Not here\n\nDIVING\n\nThere are now just 84 publicly accessible pools with diving boards in the whole of Britain, according to the Amateur Swimming Association, compared with 298 in England alone in 1977.\n\nCampaigners claim eight English counties and the city of Birmingham now have no publicly available diving boards of one metre height or above.\n\nSWIMMING\n\nBritain has 24 Olympic-length 50m pools, although one is currently closed for refurbishment while another is set to close. It works out at one pool for every 2.5 million people, compared with one for every 650,000 in France.\n\nAccording to Sport England, 352 pools opened between 2004 and last year, compared with 164 that closed. But campaigners claim the figures include those in private health clubs and hotels, and do not paint a fair picture.\n\nPLAYING FIELDS\n\nSince 1998, 187 playing fields have been sold, with 19 going in the past 18 months.\n\nA further 1,331 parcels of land smaller than 0.4 hectares have been sold off since 2001, without the need for ministerial approval.\n\nThis, despite a promise from Labour, on coming to power: \u201cWe will bring the Government\u2019s policy of forcing schools to sell playing fields to an end.\u201d\n\nGYMNASTICS\n\nUp to 240,000 aspiring gymnasts are stuck on club waiting lists, because of a lack of capacity in current facilities.\n\nEven Huntingdon, the home club of Louis Smith, who won Bronze in Beijing \u2013 Britain\u2019s first gymnastics medal for 80 years \u2013 is affected.\n\nIt cannot raise money for an extension and has a waiting list of 500 children.\n\nCYCLING\n\nThere are four fewer cycle tracks than 10 years ago due to neglect, according to British Cycling, and no tracks at all in north-east England or Yorkshire.\n\nSixteen outdoor tracks exist, as well as two competition-worthy indoor velodromes at Manchester and Newport in Wales. One of the outdoor tracks, in Edinburgh, is earmarked for closure.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00795/broomhill-pool_795268a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00795/broomhill-pool_795268c.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00795/broomhill-pool_795268a.jpg", "date": "23/08/2008"}, "rank_204": {"title": "London 2012: Scepticism over legacy plans cloud Olympic Games", "text": "The Government has set a target of getting two million more people involved in sport by 2012, yet some of those involved at the coalface claim that measures are incoherent and mis-directed.\n\nLord Newby, a Liberal Democrat peer who is chairman of sport for the Prince's Trust, remains highly sceptical of legacy plans. He said on Tuesday that he had received a letter from Lord Coe, the chairman of London 2012, explaining that it was not the role of the organisaing committee to find funding for community sport.\n\nLord Newby said: \"I accept that funding for everyone is not possible, and that it is unrealistic for the committee to solve all funding problems, but people feel that in the third sector, we need a vision, or a visionary, and a forum for those who want to leverage a genuine legacy from the Olympics. We need a forum, a working party, to see what we can do, and we need to do it now. At the moment there is no vision, no energy going into legacy creation.\"\n\nBrigid Simmonds, chair of the Central Council for Physical Recreation, insists that there is an urgent need for \"national co-ordination for sports development\" linked to the Olympic legacy plan.\n\n\"Some national governing bodies are doing what they can,\" Simmonds said. \"But they are restricted by the intellectual property limitations around the Olympic marks, which makes it difficult to create explicit links between programmes and the Games.\"\n\nSimmonds also says a caveat exists for a legacy of participation at community-level countrywide. \"There is a real need for national co-ordination on a legacy of increased participation. Sport is having some good discussions with ministers about how it might achieve that but it won't happen unless one end of the country knows what is succeeding at the other end \u2013 and that requires the Government to bring the pieces together.\n\n\"At the moment, [amateur sports] clubs feel pretty far removed from what is going on in Stratford and the challenge for organisers is to make them feel more engaged with the aims of 2012.\"\n\nThis is a view shared by several charity and volunteer groups working nationally, and by opposition politicians.\n\nDon Foster, Culture spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"I raised the whole issue with Gerry Sutcliffe on the floor of the House of Commons on Monday this week. It is deeply worrying that we made a commitment to increase sports participation, and to date not a single organisation has sat down and worked out how we are actually going to advance it.\n\n\"These are really deep concerns. There is a real stagnation and no central co-ordination, no central planning of how we are going to move forward. I'm genuinely, deeply worried about the legacy from 2012.\"\n\nAlison Moore-Gwyn, chief executive of Fields in Trust (previously the Playing Fields Association, concurs: \"The grand legacy promises made by the bid team to help secure the Games are looking increasingly hollow \u2013 particularly the aim to get two million more people physically active.\"\n\nMoore-Gwyn believes the legacy from the 2012 Games \"should be both permanent and tangible\" yet insists none of the official legacy schemes come close to achieving this.\n\n\"At Fields in Trust we have a fantastic legacy scheme to create a network of permanently protected playing fields in communities all across the UK ensuring that people will always have access to outdoor space for sport and play,\" she added.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01447/swim-games_1447585a.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01447/swim-games_1447585c.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01447/swim-games_1447585a.jpg", "date": "21/02/2009"}, "rank_13": {"title": "London 2012: Serious questions remain about Olympic legacy", "text": "\"We will make the UK a world-leading sporting nation. We will transform the heart of east London. We will inspire a new generation of young people to take part in local volunteering, cultural and physical activity.\"\n\nFour years ago Lord Coe stood before the International Olympic Committee and made an unashamed appeal to the hearts of an electorate that was about to decide the location of the 2012 summer Games. The pitch was unequivocal: a vote for London would see the Olympic brand used \"to inspire young people to choose sport\".\n\nIt proved decisive. The emphasis on legacy was a key factor in London's success, placing at the forefront of its proposal an issue that was often an afterthought.\n\nIt changed the rules of Olympic bidding, and no candidate city would today neglect the question of what the Games will leave behind. If London 2012 is to make good on its promise however, its legacy has to be more substantial than a campaign strategy, and with just over three years until the Games there are serious doubts as to whether they will deliver.\n\nFrom the 'hard' legacy of the Olympic Park, where there is still no business plan or confirmed tenants for the venues being built, to the 'soft' legacy promise of increased sports participation, questions remain.\n\nTaking the hard legacy first, it remains unclear how the facilities in the Olympic Park will be maintained and what they will be used for. A coherent plan for the Park, fusing the sports facilities with business and residential projects has been delayed by an abrupt change of approach following the election of Boris Johnson as mayor.\n\nThe London Development Agency had been charged with the project, but in February this year mayor Johnson abandoned the plan and created a new agency, the Olympic Legacy Company, to oversee the project.\n\nChair Baroness Ford has begun work three days a week and a chief executive has been appointed, but the new company will not formally begin developing a business plan that will sustain the facilities until October.\n\nThere is serious concern within the Olympic movement that the search for a financially-viable model, which has included looking at education options such as a university, risks diluting the sporting principles at its heart.\n\nAt the centre of deliberations is the question of what to do with the main Olympic Stadium. London promised the IOC a permanent 25,000-seat athletics facility after the Games, rejecting overtures from West Ham United to use the ground for football and insisting that an anchor tenant from another sport would be secured.\n\nNo tenant has been identified and now Ford is reconsidering the 25,000-seat option in favour of retaining perhaps 50,000 of the 80,000 Olympic capacity, a move that would allow the stadium to host the World Athletics Championships without having to be rebuilt.\n\nIt could also become a venue for the 2018 football World Cup and 2015 Rugby World Cup, should English bids prove successful, but how it will be paid for remains uncertain.\n\nThe stadium issue is mirrored across the Park, with the velodrome, aquatic centre and hockey complex all demanding subsidy if financing cannot be found.\n\nThis problem may come to be the least of London's worries compared to the task of delivering on the participation agenda. As well as being hugely challenging, it is a deeply political issue which has fractured the cross-party consensus on the Olympics.\n\nIt has also strained patience at the London 2012 Organising Committee (Locog), where senior figures are conscious that Coe will be held responsible if the promises he made are not delivered.\n\nHugh Robertson, the shadow Olympics minister, has been a persistent critic. \"The lack of a mass participation legacy is the biggest single flaw in the 2012 project, and since 2005 we have made little or no progress on delivering on that promise,\" he said.\n\nJowell rejects the charge: \"By 2012 every child will be offered five hours of sport a week and... we have half a million more people taking part in sport at grass-roots level. Some people say this would have happened anyway. It wouldn't.\n\n\"In terms of planning for a legacy in and around the park, we are far advanced in comparison to other countries at this stage. That's because legacy hasn't been an afterthought, it has been a key part of our plans from the outset.\"\n\nThe Government's central participation commitment is to getting two million more people into sport or physical activity by 2012. It has also cited the delivery of five hours of sport in all schools \u2013 an old commitment \u2013 and the provision of free swimming for under-16s and OAPs \u2013 genuinely new, if limited in ambition \u2013 as part of the participation package.\n\nThe two million target is not straightforward, however. Only half of participants actually have to play sport, with Sport England responsible for finding them using \u00a3500 million of government funding distributed to governing bodies.\n\nResponsibility for delivering the other million into \"physical activity\" lies with other government departments, principally the Department of Health. Among the activities that will count towards this target is gardening, a subject noticeable by its absence from Coe's Singapore speech.\n\nIt is this dilution of the commitment to sport that most worries those who hoped the 2012 Games would be a landmark moment for the UK, pushing the passion for sport into practical action.\n\nJowell, Johnson and London 2012 have less than three years to prove them wrong and make good on their promises.\n\nOlympic legacy by numbers\n\nBy Simon Hart\n\n\u00a38 billion\n\nThe Government\u2019s construction budget, including a \u00a32 billion contingency fund.\n\n\u00a3140 millionThe cost of funding free swimming for OAPs and under-16s.

There are some good individual initiatives but nothing has been drawn together. Time is running out to get this right. I think we have a year, at the most, to get this right and get a tangible benefit from the Olympics,\" he said.\n\nOn the park, Hunt's priority is to make sure elite sport is at the heart of all of the venues including the main stadium, which could host a school as its main tenant rather than a sport.\n\nA new company has been established to run the facilities but is yet to take control of the project, and Hunt wants elite sport as the centrepiece.\n\n\"A lot of the plans that have been put together are excellent but the sporting part is missing. I am hearing rumours that the Olympic Park may not even be called 'Olympic'. Were that to happen all the emotional and psychological buy-in the public have would evaporate,\" he said.\n\n\"It has to be the Olympic Park, that makes it a sporting home for the country. For certain sports it will become a key location such as swimming who have done some great planning. Athletics, hockey and cycling all want a true legacy in the park.\n\n\"There is a need for these facilities to be in London and they should be the best in the country if not Europe come 2012, and we need to use these to attract and drive European and international competition in London.\"\n\nHunt supports suggestions that the stadium should retain at least 50,000 seats rather than 25,000 so it can host world-class events, and will resist attempts to prioritise community over elite use.\n\n\"The money that will be spent converting it from a 80,000 to 25,000 is a serious amount of capital, but what does that look like as an operating cost for the stadium, and should we be more ambitious about what the stadium can be used for in terms of bringing international competition to this country?\"\n\nOn the participation legacy Hunt is highly critical of the Government, saying there is a lack of clear policy and casting doubt on the pledge to get two million more people \"physically active\", only one million of whom will have to actually play a sport.\n\n\"To me it looks like there are some good initiatives but there are lots of arguments around how participation is counted and that all looks very grey to me. We need to know how we can genuinely measure an increase in sporting participation as a result of the Olympics.\n\n\"We need more than initiatives, we need policy that clearly sets out and underpins the agenda. I am unclear what the policies are that will drive increased sports participation and get us back to Seb Coe's 2005 promise to use the power of the Games to inspire young people to choose sport. That is policy driven and I do not think that has been thought through.\"", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01437/andy-hunt_1437795c.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01437/andy-hunt_1437795a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01437/andy-hunt_1437795a.jpg", "date": "07/07/2009"}, "rank_16": {"title": "London 2012: Olympic legacy winners and losers", "text": "They are the big winners in the legacy game, beneficiaries of millions of pounds of investment that will leave their sports with permanent, state-of-the-art facilities that will be enjoyed by elite athletes and the local community for years to come.\n\n\"We believe the pool will rejuvenate swimming in the East End of London,\" said British Swimming chief executive David Sparkes of the new \u00a3244 million aquatics centre taking shape in the Olympic Park in Stratford. \"It will also be a fantastic training and competition venue.\"\n\nBut where there are winners there are also losers, and for the majority of Britain's Olympic sports one is reminded of Anne Robinson's catchphrase on 'The Weakest Link': \"You leave with nothing.\"\n\nWhen the flat-pack temporary venues are dismantled and existing buildings such as the ExCeL centre and the 02 Arena are returned to their normal use, 17 Olympic sports will have no bricks-and-mortar legacy at all by which to remember the world's greatest sports festival.\n\nThe justification for building so few permanent structures is that the London organisers are simply following International Olympic Committee orders in cutting down on extravagance and avoiding white elephants.\n\nIn its bid book, London made much of the fact that no permanent venues would be built unless there was an identifiable need for sporting facilities after the Games.\n\nBut there are some who believe they have gone too far and that an opportunity is being missed to provide long-lasting facilities for Olympic sport.\n\nBritish Shooting is even contemplating seeking a judicial review of the decision to stage the shooting competition in an entirely temporary venue at Woolwich Barracks, at a cost estimated to be as high as \u00a342 million, instead of investing in a permanent legacy at Bisley, in Surrey.\n\nGlynn Alger, secretary general of the National Rifle Association, said: \"The only legacy Londoners will remember from shooting will be disruption caused by the building and demolition of the Woolwich venue.\"\n\nAQUATICS (swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, water polo finals, modern pentathlon swimming element)\n\nWhere: Olympic Park, Stratford.

And the trouble-shooter who presided over Disneyland Paris before valiantly trying to rescue the Dome has a stark warning about the Olympics: if you thought the Dome was a disaster, wait till you see the London Games.\n\n\"The Olympics is going exactly the same way as the Dome, except it is 15 times more expensive,\" he says. \"It is a time bomb. British politicians have been there before, so why face the embarrassment again? You are setting yourself up for a massive fall.\"\n\nHis complaint? No one is in charge, budgets balloon seemingly of their own accord, disastrous decisions are made in secret, and the media is deceived. To students of the Millennium Dome fiasco it does indeed sound spookily familiar.\n\n\"This could be the biggest embarrassment ever,\" warns Gerbeau, now a popular business commentator and performer on programmes such as Question Time , while also running a successful business in London turning round failing companies.\n\n\"It is a ludicrous, half-baked organisation. Why is there no transparency? The building programme goes massively over budget and amazingly there is no public report asking what has gone wrong. If I'd gone so over-budget in a PLC without explaining why, I'd go to jail. The entire system is designed to cover people's bottoms. The tent was exactly the same. It's a disgrace.\"\n\nAnd just as the Dome was conceived in the dog days of John Major's administration, so Gerbeau suggests the Olympics is suffering from an equally impotent and incompetent Gordon Brown government. \"Who is in charge? Nobody. The malaise over the Olympics reflects the broader political malaise.\"\n\nGerbeau's solution? \"We should give it to the Frogs,\" smiles the former winter Olympian who represented French at ice hockey. \"They would take it. They have all the transport and stadia infrastructure, they would only need to build an Olympic village. It would then leave \u00a350bn to inject into the British economy at a time of great hardship.\" Would France do it better? \"No question. It's not about savoir faire, they are just better placed.\"\n\nAnd before Gerbeau is accused of French bias, he is a rampant Anglophile who took considerable stick from former teammates when he turned out for Britain against France in a recent veteran's hockey match. He lives in London with his British wife and child (\"I married the enemy\"), describing himself as \"an economic refugee from the last communist country in Europe\". He also acknowledges Britain proved it can host big events, such as Manchester's Commonwealth Games in 2002. But for 2012, he simply thinks the cost is too high, the process too flawed.\n\n\"We need to really think if we want it or whether we can dump it. And if we are to keep it we need a national debate. If we want to go ahead fine, but the public have to be engaged, perhaps with a referendum. And then there must be quarterly reports into every aspect of the building programme.\" He pauses: \"The Olympics really put Spain on the map. It should be getting really exciting now, the biggest thing to happen to Britain for a decade. Instead there are only problems. And if you vilify the media and lie to it, saying it knows nothing, there is sure to be a backlash.\"\n\nHe claims he tried a novel approach when he took over Peter Mandelson's Dome: telling the truth. And while it was too late to save a poorly conceived attraction, perceptions did improve.\n\nOh, talking of the Dome, Gerbeau reveals that Michael Jackson did visit the now re-named O2 after all. Before his sudden death Jackson was limbering up for a series of comeback concerts to be staged there, but back when Gerbeau was running the Dome Jackson made a secret inspection.\n\n\"We kept it quiet as we didn't think publicity would do either of us any good,\" laughs Gerbeau, who reveals he became friends with Jackson when opening Disneyland Paris at night so that Jackson and his entourage of children could visit without being disturbed.\n\n\"I was on standby to give evidence on his behalf in his court case,\" says Gerbeau. \"He was strange, but not a dodgy man. The kids were only there to give him an alibi to behave like a seven-year-old. It was wonderful to get to know the best showman on the planet - apart from all the sleep it cost me while Michael embarked on his 13th ride on the same attraction.\"\n\nTo Gerbeau's disappointment, a little of that Disneyland escapism still pervades French life. \"The attitude is 'we want to work less and be paid more'. When I left France I was being taxed 54%, so you just think 'why bother?'\" He hoped President Nicolas Sarkozy, who courted London ex-pats like Gerbeau during his election campaign, would shake France out of its state-ist lethargy.\n\n\"Sarkozy is more interested in climbing onto a six-foot supermodel than tackling France's economic malaise,\" is Gerbeau's rather earthy assessment. \"He is using the financial crisis as an excuse to attack the Anglo-Saxon model; he was doing nothing even before the crisis.\"\n\nYou can see why Gerbeau in his eyrie overlooking Buckingham Palace rather enjoys living in Britain; he has had done well in his adopted country. A sign in his office says \"Aston Martins park here. All other cars will be crushed\"; Gerbeau does indeed have an Aston, and a Lamborghini. He is great friends with Colin Montgomerie, the golfer, and is a member of five of our smarter courses, having become a scratch player in two years.\n\n\"I bust my leg in four places playing ice hockey, which was devastating as I dreamed of carrying the French flag at the winter Olympics,\" he says looking down. \"But my ankle turned 360 degrees and that was the end of that. I spent 14 months trying to get out of a wheelchair and people try to talk to me about pressure. I told myself I could sit on a bench and become an alcoholic or do something with my life. I found golf has a very similar action to hockey, so I took up golf, and I also went into business.\"\n\nAnd that, despite his jokey demeanour and slightly unfortunate green tank top, is something he takes seriously. He shrugs at piles of sporting and celebrity memorabilia: \"People take the p*** out of my office, but it's where I spend 90% of my time so I don't want it to be boring.\"\n\nIncreasingly Gerbeau is exercised by politics \u2013 high taxes, federalism, corruption \u2013 and it would be no surprise to see him stand for office. He is contemptuous of the political class, recounting how \"horrible\" he found Caroline Flint in the green room before they appeared together on Question Time. He hopes the expenses scandal will result in \"400 new MPs\" at the next election, and he has sage advice to Eurosceptics.\n\n\"If you don't want a federal Europe you have to start learning about what the EU is doing,\" he says, waving his arms passionately. \"It's where 70% of important decisions are made. And if you are worried about the expenses of MPs, MEPs are twice as bad.\"\n\nHe warns that Europe in general and Britain in particular is \"creeping towards the French model\" from Anglo-Saxon disciplines. He suggests there are limits to free markets and notes France enjoys superior public services, but that Britain now has the worst of all worlds: high taxes, low quality schools, hospitals and transport. He is desperate to say \"au revoir\" to Gordon Brown, whom he accuses of implementing many continental polices \"which led to 90% of entrepreneurs leaving France .\" But Gerbeau has yet to see anything from David Cameron to suggest the Conservatives have an alternative vision. \"Where,\" he demands rhetorically \"is the big fire? Maybe it's time for a new party.\"\n\nBefore that, maybe it's time for a new leader of our Olympic project. The Dome connection will hardly put much wind behind his candidacy, but if we won't give the Games to France, perhaps we should give it to our favourite \"fat little Frenchman\".

I\u2019ve been lucky enough to stand on the top level of the Olympic Stadium, which is further along than most of us could have imagined. Remember Wembley?\n\nIt\u2019s not the Bird\u2019s Nest [in Beijing], but it doesn\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s a real stadium already. I think the debate over how the stadium will be adapted and utilised after 2012 will continue to run for some time.\n\nThe defining architectural symbol of the Olympic Park will surely be the wave-like roof of the aquatics centre. It\u2019s already quite a sight.\n\nKeeping on budget and coping with the recession will remain major challenges. The fact that the project is progressing so rapidly despite the downturn is notable.\n\nTransport will be one of the biggest tests for Locog. Getting people on time to and from the venues across the capital will be critical. The Javelin train service could be crucial. For the media, the dedicated buses from hotels in Bloomsbury must be reliable.\n\nThe British crowds and London\u2019s backdrop should make the Games special. The great unknown, as ever, is the weather.

The company was formed in May this year by the Government and the Mayor of London and we expect it to be fully established in October this year.\n\nWe are clear in our aim: to transform the Olympic Park into a new prosperous and sustainable community for east London and to be a successful catalyst for investment and development opportunities.\n\nRealising the potential of the Games, in terms of its legacy to the capital and the country, has been at the heart of work that is already completed or has been started by the Olympic Delivery Authority and the London Development Agency. We will carry on from this excellent foundation, working alongside the five host boroughs and our partners in the public and private sectors.\n\nIn the short term, we will be reviewing some aspects of the current legacy masterplan for the site with the aim of having a second iteration by the end of the year.\n\nIt will not happen overnight. Our plans will evolve and will look towards a 25-year horizon as we shape the park's landscape to create new communities with thousands of new homes, job opportunities and world-class sporting, educational and cultural facilities which will match those anywhere in the world.\n\nDuring the Games, the 246-hectare Olympic Park will accommodate permanent and temporary facilities including the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre and the Velopark. There will also be the Olympic Village, a media centre and new parkland all built around the Lea Valley waterways.\n\nAfter the Games, the sporting legacy of the park will be at the core of our plans to fulfil the legacy obligations for community and elite sports participation. The centrepiece sporting venues and their ancillary faculties will be retained and adapted for use by sports clubs and the local community, as well as for elite and amateur athletes.\n\nThe Olympic Village, where athletes and officials will stay during the Games, will be converted into homes with many available for key workers such as teachers and nurses.\n\nA further 10,000 new homes will be developed on the Olympic Park site itself. More than 40 per cent of these will be for families, with a large proportion offering affordable housing.\n\nThey will sit within all the elements which make up good communities: schools, libraries, shops, cafes, restaurants, green space and a wide range of community facilities to be developed alongside major cultural and visitor attractions.\n\nOne of our success measures will be transforming the park into a \"must see, must return\" destination for thousands of visitors from home and overseas.\n\nIn a similar way that South Kensington was bequeathed the legacy of the 1851 Great Exhibition as a world-beating cultural quarter and home to the capital's great museums, the Olympic Park can become a place of first choice for people to live, work and visit for generations to come \u2013 a place to celebrate its historic sporting legacy.\n\nAlready many of the transport improvements serving the Park are under way, including an extension to the Docklands Light Railway, increased capacity on the Jubilee Line and the upgrade of Stratford Regional Station.\n\nSurrounding the park, people will enjoy wider access to the parkland and open spaces via a network of canal towpaths, footpaths and cycleways.\n\nLondon is the first host city to have set up a dedicated legacy company for the Olympic Park site before the Games have even started. Together with our new chief executive, Andrew Altman, and my soon-to-be-appointed board, we are proud to be given such an excellent foundation.\n\nThere are a great many opportunities for us all to work together \u2013 not just to get it done, but to get it right.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01451/aquatics-centre_1451980a.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01451/aquatics-centre_1451980c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01451/aquatics-centre_1451980a.gif", "date": "28/07/2009"}, "rank_95": {"title": "Council recruits Olympics co-ordinator despite staging no events", "text": "The council is looking to appoint the adviser on a three-year contract with the task of ensuring \"the Surrey 2012 programme has maximum impact.\"\n\nThe council had hoped that Bisley in the county would be chosen to stage the shooting event but Olympic organisers eventually awarded the competition to a rival bidder.\n\nA job advert says the council wants someone who will create an Olympic legacy for the county.\n\n\"The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games offer a once in a lifetime chance to make a positive difference,\" it states. \"We are looking for someone who will help Surrey's residents and businesses gain from this unique opportunity.\n\n\"We are looking for a skilled networker and influencer, who can inspire innovation and creativity in our partners.\"\n\nThe county is expected to provide facilties for a number of athletes competing in London during the games.\n\nMatthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said existing council officers can do the job.\n\n\"Given that Surrey aren't even hosting any Olympic events in 2012, this job is unnecessary,\" he said. \"If there are implications for transport, leisure or other services, then that falls well within the jobs of existing council officers who are already quite well paid enough to do the job.\n\n\"This smacks of gimmickry by the council, who seem more keen to demonstrate that they are in touch with current events than to deliver good value for money.\"\n\nA council spokesman said that although they are not hosting any events the co-ordinator will be seeking Olympics related contracts for the county.\n\nDenise Saliagopoulos, the county council's Cabinet Member for Community Services and the 2012 Games, said: \"Surrey's businesses play a key role in making the county a prosperous, vibrant place.\n\n\"If they thrive, we all benefit.

Let\u2019s not just have them in the stadium in London for three weeks only.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have them in every school, in every town, in every city and every county not just in 2012 but every year from then on.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use the London Olympics to bring back school sports league tables, with a proper system of town, city, regional and national heats.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s use 2012 to bring competitive sport \u2013 and sporting values \u2013 within the grasp of all young people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe values of competitive sport are crucial in creating a society that brings out the best in young people.

The sight of landscaping, often an afterthought in Olympic construction, will boost optimism about the evolution of London\u2019s park.\n\nWhile the final venues for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics remain uncertain \u2013 both sports are being pressed to accept Wembley Arena \u2013 progress on-site has been relatively smooth, albeit at a fearsome cost to the taxpayer.\n\nPlans to privately finance the Olympic village and media and broadcast centres collapsed like a distressed marathon runner as the credit crunch bit last year, and the public bail-out of both projects ensures that the bulk of the \u00a39.3?billion build budget will be spent.\n\nMore than \u00a31billion of contingency funding remains unspent, which will help as the immovable deadline nears and the big-ticket items approach completion. The Olympic Delivery Authority reaches its maximum of 10,000 workers in the next year.\n\nThe next 12 months will see the concrete-and-steel skeletons on site fleshed out, with the roof of the aquatic centre, which doubles as the main pedestrian access to the park, due for completion next summer.\n\nThe big deadline is the summer of 2011 when all the sports venues have to be complete and handed to the London organising committee for test events. The velodrome, Olympic Stadium, aquatics centre, international broadcast centre, basketball and handball arenas are all due to be ready 12 months out from the Games.\n\nIf its going to happen the ODA and its partners will need to maintain their discipline, particularly in relation to industrial relations, and make sure that they shrewdly use the pot of contingency cash to keep the wheels of progress turning.\n\nTICKETS\n\nPerhaps the most controversial and emotive issue the organising committee faces between now and the opening ceremony is ticketing.\n\nAbout nine million tickets for the 26 Olympic sports will go on sale in 2011 and it will probably prove impossible to please everyone.\n\nThe key issues are price and availability. London won its bid on a promise of minimum ticket prices of around \u00a315, but the economic realities of funding the Games means that figure has already been abandoned as organisers seek to meet their target of \u00a32 billion in commercial revenue.\n\nWith higher prices certain the organising committee has to balance affordability with accessibility. Tickets have to be available to people from across the country and they have to be within the reach of ordinary families, particularly given the huge taxpayer investment in the project.\n\nThe question of sponsor and VIP access to events is also sensitive and London can ill-afford to allow the huge banks of empty seats left by sponsors in Beijing to be repeated.\n\nLocog are already talking to the IOC about ways in which they can quickly fill areas of seating that have been left vacant, including bussing in schoolchildren to the Olympic Park in order to use them to fill in when required.\n\nTHE OLYMPIC SPIRIT\n\nWhile the heavy lifting continues on site the organising committee has to develop a look, feel and tone for the Games that captures the public imagination. The challenge is to change post-recession perceptions so the project is seen as a point of light at the end of the tunnel, rather than a drain on over-stretched public finances.\n\nTo do this they will need to establish an identity that has widespread appeal while satisfying the fundamentals of London\u2019s bid promise, that it would be a modern, vital and youthful Games.\n\nThis being an Olympics with a hard commercial edge one of the primary vehicles for this will be merchandising, which means mascots. They will be launched next year, a furry and probably irritating indicator of what is to come.\n\nTRANSPORT\n\nLondon's transport system is not going to turn into a network worthy of a first-world capital city just because the Olympics are coming, and ensuring the capital keeps the Games moving is a priority for the organising committee.\n\nTransport for London and Games organisers are hoping that they can exploit the summer holidays with which the Olympics coincide to ease pressure on the network. Fast-tracked developments including the Dockland Light Railway extension, that will see five new stations open by next summer, should help.\n\nMore controversial are plans to introduce an Olympic Route Network that will see 'Zil lanes\u2019 marked on some of the capital\u2019s major roads, with use restricted to athletes, officials, media and VIPs for the duration.\n\nA massive public consultation is underway to try to prepare London motorists but the issue is bound to prompt complaints, and Boris Johnson is on-the-record saying he opposes the concept.\n\nThe Olympic lanes will be particularly important if plans to use Wembley Arena as a venue are given the go-ahead. The most optimistic journey time for the trip from the athletes\u2019 village Stratford to Wembley is 37 minutes, while the most realistic suggests it will take at least an hour.\n\nThat will not please the badminton players and rhythmic gymnasts sketched to be competing at the venue, so London will have to come-up with a bullet proof plan to convince sceptics.\n\nLEGACY\n\nLondon's pitch to the IOC was based on the promise of a Games to inspire the youth of the world, and to revolutionise participation in sport in the UK. Grandiose pledges made in the midst of a bid campaign seldom become reality but London\u2019s credibility rests on delivering on this fundamental issue.\n\nThe transformational potential of the Olympics helped unlock Treasury vaults for the redevelopment of east London, but the public will not tolerate white elephants and there must be a sporting and health dividend for the UK to justify the cost.\n\nWorryingly this is where progress has been most patchy, perhaps because the methodology for delivering it is woolly. Just how do you tempt a teenager off the sofa, or his father out of the pub?\n\nSeb Coe believes it will take co-ordinated thinking by policy makers allied to the inspirational power of a great games, and slowly there are signs that the first is being delivered.\n\nAfter Johnson ripped up existing plans following his election Baroness Ford is now chairing the Olympic Legacy Delivery Company, which will be responsible for managing the Olympic Park post-Games. Finding a permanent tenant for the main stadium, or failing that a business plan that pays its way remains the major challenge.\n\nThe soft legacy is more difficult, but the government insists that its initiatives such as free swimming are helping deliver on its target of 2 million more people doing sport or physical exercise by London 2012.\n\nAssuming they win the next election, the Conservatives face a challenge to turn Labour\u2019s promises into reality.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01513/london2012_1513040a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01513/london2012_1513040c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01513/london2012_1513040a.jpg", "date": "30/10/2009"}, "rank_205": {"title": "World Cup 2018: guide to the shortlisted host cities for England's bid", "text": "London: Wembley will be the centre piece for the entire bid, while the Emirates Stadium was another automatic selection. That leaves a choice between the Olympic Stadium and the new White Hart Lane, something that will ultimately hinge on a political decision over the Olympic legacy.\n\nLiverpool: The doubts over the ability of Liverpool's owners to fund their new stadium had prompted rumours that the city could miss out. However, the 2018 bid team is satisfied that either Anfield or the planned 72,000-capacity stadium could host World Cup matches.\n\nBirmingham: A famous FA Cup semi-final venue, Villa Park also has a rich international pedigree, having hosted international matches across three different centuries, including three games in the 1966 World Cup. It was always among the certainties to be included in the bid.\n\nMilton Keynes: Perhaps the most eye-catching selection, but logistically one of the safer bets. As a city that is just 43 years old, the transport and local infrastructure are excellent and the intention now is to extend the stadium to a capacity of 44,000.\n\nManchester: Both major stadiums in Manchester have hosted European finals and are already built to the required size, while Old Trafford will be in the running to stage one of the semi-finals. Manchester also won plaudits for the way it hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\n\nSheffield: Hillsborough remains one of the most historic venues in English football and, having previously hosted matches at both the 1966 World Cup, and 1996 European Championships, would be renovated and extended to 44,000 for the World Cup.\n\nBristol: The new Ashton Vale stadium will be built to a capacity of 44,000 and its selection will help avert criticisms of the 1966 World Cup and Euro'96, which had no West Country venues, even though Bristol is England's sixth largest city.\n\nNewcastle: Another city with an enormous heritage and fervour for football. St James' Park is well situated near the centre of Newcastle and the main train station and is already of the required size to host matches in the World Cup.\n\nLeeds: Leeds United may have slipped to the third tier of English football, but the city remains one of English football's heartlands. Improvements will be made to Elland Road, but the intention is for the capacity to be extended to over 51,000.\n\nNottingham: A surprise choice as only the second Midlands venue, but a city synonymous with football after Brian Clough's achievements in the 1970s and 1980s. A proposed new stadium will have a capacity of 45,300 and be based in Clifton, replacing the old City Ground.\n\nSunderland: The City of Light Stadium is another venue that is already built and could theoretically hold World Cup matches immediately. Its inclusion alongside St James' Park also guarantees that, with Manchester and London, the North East will be one of the three main focal points for the tournament.\n\nPlymouth: Location was surely the primary factor in Plymouth's inclusion and understandably so. Following the withdrawal of Portsmouth, it is the only South Coast venue and the matches are guaranteed to attract huge support across Devon and Cornwall. Home Park is to be increased to a 43,946 capacity.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02817/oliver-brown_2817670j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01545/stadia_1545028a.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03202/Ibraauditions_3202090g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/91952193_LONDON_EN_3589285g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01545/stadia_1545028c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03473/sam-wallace_3473003j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03127/charlie_eccleshare_3127601j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03584/lpool1_3584875g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03193/Youngsters_3193023g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Jason_Burt_2417299j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03587/arsenal1_3587463g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03076/zola-top100_3076216g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03431/harry-redknapp_3431318j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03102/Managers_3102424g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03189/chris-bascombe_3189184j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03618/younge_3618639g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03152/facup1_3152834g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/blood_3589220g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Telegraph_football_3588075g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/DERBIES_3589123g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Cheltenham_300x50_3588742a.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03254/overrated2_3254402g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03187/topp-100-50_3187081g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03523/PLAYING-MANAGERS_3523946g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03218/hardmensplit_3218019g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03220/team_3220787g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03479/zlatan-ibrahimovic_3479216g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03254/undercompo1_3254514g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01545/stadia_1545028a.jpg", "date": "17/12/2009"}, "rank_193": {"title": "London 2012: British Shooting facing \u00a3400,000 Olympic legacy bill", "text": "The governing body, which had originally campaigned for a permanent legacy for the sport by holding the Olympic competition at its headquarters at Bisley, Surrey, has learnt that it will now have to find at least \u00a3400,000 if it wants to make long-term use of the temporary facilities that will be erected at the Royal Artillery Barracks.\n\nThat is the Government's estimate of the extra cost of making facilities \"relocatable\", which it insists is not part of the existing Woolwich budget.

How to deliver the Games that Britain promised in the face of huge cuts to the public purse?\n\nIt is a pressing quandary for the coalition and its sports minister Hugh Robertson, who came into office promising to deliver not just a world-class Games but a meaningful and abiding sporting legacy. The first part of the bargain may be easier to deliver than the second.\n\nWith just two years to go until the opening ceremony in Stratford, almost all of the construction work has been planned and contracted, with the next 12 months bringing the most intense period of work on the Olympic Park as it heads towards a completion date this time next year.\n\nThat means there is little room for manoeuvre in the \u00a39.3 billion construction and infrastructure pot agreed by the last Government. David Higgins, chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, has estimated that around \u00a3850 million of the contingency fund will remain unspent come next summer. Robertson's challenge will be to persuade the Treasury to allow that funding to remain within the broader Olympic pot, helping to underwrite other costs, including legacy projects, rather than being clawed back to help fill the deficit hole.\n\nIt is harder to see how the Olympic legacy, a promise that lay at the heart of London's bid and the incoming Government's sports manifesto, can be delivered as originally envisaged.\n\nThe Department of Culture, Media and Sport is responsible for co-ordinating the legacy, as well as the Government's approach to the Games, but it spent the first half of July drawing up proposed cuts of 25 and 40 per cent ahead of the comprehensive spending review due in the autumn.\n\nEven if the Treasury goes for the lower figure, that still means \u00a32 billion off the annual budget. As the smallest department in Whitehall, even one with an Olympics to deliver, it is hard to see the Treasury making an exception when the axe falls.\n\nThe cuts have made for a gloomy mood in the department in the run up to the two-years-to-go anniversary, with the reality that civil service jobs could be on the line as part of the austerity measures. Despite this, Robertson stresses his commitment to the Games and its potential to transform the British sporting landscape. He is hopeful that the ODA's careful stewardship of the construction project and an increase in the distribution of National Lottery funds to sport, will allow him to deliver. Specifically he wants the unused construction contingency to be channelled into the legacy project.\n\n\"The CSR process is only just started and it is going to have an impact on all departments, but because the ODA have made such good progress they have not used all of the contingency,\" he told The Daily Telegraph.\n\n\"There will be other areas that are not backed by contingency that might require support. No one wants to take the savings from the building project, give them back to the Treasury and then have to go back at a later date asking for more.\n\n\"We are in the process of articulating what the sports legacy means and we have made good progress in this regard. We know we will be able to finance it through the National Lottery, which we have restored to give sport its original 20 per cent share of the take.\"\n\nHe has already announced an Olympic-style school sport competition, and he has asked the British Olympic Association to work with Sport England on developing community projects.\n\nRobertson is also effusive in his praise for the ODA \u2013 \"I would be surprised if there was a body in British public life that has succeeded as spectacularly as it has in the last year\" \u2013 and confident that the construction project will be completed on time and to budget.\n\nWhile there is confidence about the Olympic Park, Robertson says \"the penny is finally beginning to drop\" among his colleagues across government about the scale of the challenge looming in 2012. A Games does not stop with the sports minister. \"It stretches from the Home Office with the security responsibility, to the Foreign Office, which will be looking after 120 visiting heads of state, to the Department of Transport, which has to deliver the transport plan, and to us here at DCMS, who will have the job of delivering and co-ordinating it,\" he said.\n\n\"The trick for us is to drive more out of the projects that we are running across government, to 'Olympify' what we are doing to make sure that we take full advantage of what we are doing. At a time when the economy is very challenging it is great to have an event around which we can pull together.\"", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01684/olympic-park_1684859c.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01684/olympic-park_1684859a.gif"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01684/olympic-park_1684859a.gif", "date": "23/07/2010"}, "rank_253": {"title": "London 2012: \u00a3600 million budget unlikely to be enough for Games security", "text": "There could be a reshuffle of monies and responsibilities to tap into other Government security-related budgets.\n\nThis comes as a review of Olympic security conducted by Baroness Pauline Neville Jones is nearing completion and the Government is exacting savage cuts in its comprehensive review settlement.\n\nIt is understood Lady Neville-Jones's review will pinpoint the operational areas of the departments, such as the Metropolitan Police, London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, the Home Office and the Olympic Delivery Authority, and reallocate monies accordingly.\n\nThe Home Office is in control of policing and security during the Olympics.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We are reviewing the security arrangements, including the budget, to ensure that the measures in place are the right ones.

However, the ambitious pledge to revamp the Stratford region into a commercial base is attracting significant doubts in development and corporate circles. Can a hitherto unloved area of east London credibly be overhauled in such a manner?\n\nNot only is the OPLC battling against the chequered post-Games history of most Olympic cities, but it is being challenged by the recession and competition from other regeneration projects. As Stratford seeks to promote itself as a realistic commercial district for creative industries, Nine Elms, Kings Cross and Paddington are trying to do the same.\n\nPatrick Grincell, senior director in the planning team at Savills, says: \"We are in a depressed market and this is likely to remain the case for a while. Nothing is easy at the moment and it's going to be a challenge for all those sites moving forward in the short term. The real challenge for Stratford will be to maintain momentum after the Games.\"\n\nThe man in charge of attempting to meet Stratford's regeneration goals is Andrew Altman, the former deputy mayor of Philadelphia who has been chief executive of the OPLC since its creation in May 2009.\n\nThis week, more hurdles have been put in his way with the change at the top of the Olympic Delivery Authority following the departure of chief executive David Higgins to Network Rail, and rumours that the OPLC will be scrapped as part of a Coalition bonfire of quangos.\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Telegraph, he said Mr Higgins's move was a \"huge loss\" to the ODA but that he expects a \"solid transition\". The American also dismissed the potential demise of the OPLC, insisting that a potential outcome is the Government scrapping its involvement and the OPLC moving solely under the remit of the Mayor of London.\n\nHe added: \"We are part of the Comprehensive Spending Review and we are waiting to see what the outcome of that is.\"\n\nDespite the doubts, Mr Altman's ambition for the site has not diminished. \"Obviously there are challenges, but I think there is a great opportunity here. I think what makes the Olympic site unique is that it is incredibly bold. Some projects have a bold transport scheme, some have amenities, but it's extraordinary to have all in one place.\"\n\nOn the ground in Stratford, there are already examples of dramatic commercial change.\n\nAs well as the towering Westfield Stratford, which will be the biggest urban shopping centre in Europe when it is completed, new residential developments \u2013 primarily apartment blocks \u2013 are growing out of the ground.\n\nOne of those is by Thornsett Group, which in May completed a block of 64 luxury apartments at Lett Road.\n\nBernadette Cunningham, a director at the company, says: \"If the Olympics weren't happening would Stratford be a no-man's land? Yes, probably.\"\n\nHowever, while Miss Cunningham says the investment and manpower being poured into Stratford suggest it will enjoy an \"amazing\" regeneration, she warns that the recession has ravaged the ambition for private sector redevelopment in the area.\n\nShe estimates that just 10pc of the private apartments planned for the area ahead of the Olympics will be built because of the banks' reluctance to finance towers.\n\n\"For banks, towers have become a no-go because you can't phase the development, it has to be built in one go,\" she adds.\n\nThe recession and the constraints on finance are also a hindrance to Matthew Black, senior development director at property agent CBRE, as he tries to bring private investment to the area. Mr Black is helping the OPLC to attract businesses to the media centre while CBRE is also involved in letting the\n\n100,000 sq ft of offices that Westfield plans to construct alongside its shopping centre, to which Capita has been linked.\n\nMr Black says he is \"reasonably confident\" about bringing companies to Stratford, pointing out that commercial rents will be cheaper than in other parts of London and stressing that Stratford will have the \"best communication and transport infrastructure in the country\" after the Olympics.\n\nOver the next two months, Mr Black and the OPLC will compile a list of which businesses are interested in the site, with developers, operators, and potential occupiers invited to file proposals. He says there is a \"desire\" to make the area a media district, but that all sectors are welcome to apply. Conclusions of the market testing exercise will be made on December 17.\n\nHowever, his task is considerable. A report by the London Assembly published last month warned that finding a tenant for the media development would be difficult not only due to the economic downturn, but also because of the 23-minute walk from the building to Stratford station, the lack of central heating, and the amount of pillars in the walls of the broadcast centre limiting potential revamps.\n\nMr Altman, however, is positive. \"We don't have to wait like other projects for transport and infrastructure,\" he says.\n\n\"Also, we are going to have the largest urban mall in Europe,\" he continues. \"When people ask 'When are we going to see the legacy? I say 'Look now'.\"\n\nIn an era of public belt-tightening, the ambition surrounding the Olympics and its legacy is refreshing. Sebastian Coe, chairman of Locog, has never wavered from his legacy pledge since 2005, insisting the Games and its \u00a39.3bn budget will give something back to communities. Mr Altman claims that the Games have accelerated regeneration in Stratford by \"a generation\", while the profile and fixed deadline with which the project has been provided by the Olympics will also help it to be successful.\n\nHowever, while there is much in its favour, in order for the regeneration to work, Altman and co will need to show the competitive spirit set to be demonstrated during the Games themselves.

It has proved easier said than done however, and after five years of wrangling the issue continues to cloud discussions over the legacy use of the stadium.\n\nOn Thursday it overshadowed the launch of the revised masterplan for the park, which as widely predicted will be known Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park from 2013.\n\nLast week West Ham, in partnership with Newham Council, and Tottenham Hotspur, in partnership with the owners of the O2, AEG, both submitted initial bids for the stadium.\n\nWest Ham are committed to retaining the running track as well as a second warm-up track outside the stadium for community use, but AEG president Tim Leiweke said that the track would have to be ripped out for it to be attractive to Tottenham.\n\nHis comments re-opened the debate over whether an athletics legacy is viable, but on Thursday London mayor Boris Johnson, sports minister Hugh Roberston and Baroness Ford, the chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, all repeated the mantra that the stadium\u2019s tenants should provide an athletics legacy.\n\n\u201cThey would have to meet the Olympic promise for use of an athletics stadium - that has not changed,\u201d said Ford, though she stopped short of saying that the track must be permanent.\n\nAt the same time, though, Robertson expressed scepticism about the viability of London\u2019s bid for the 2015 World Athletics Championship. Without the Government agreeing to underwrite the staging costs of the event, and to share any losses, London\u2019s bid will be withdrawn.\n\nIf it is, the UK will effectively be saying it will not host international track-and-field events in London at the same time as the OPLC demands that West Ham and Tottenham commit to a stadium designed to stage precisely such events.\n\nThe result could be London ending up with an athletics legacy that it does not use.\n\nTo add to the sense of farce, the British Olympic Association revealed that as a condition of allowing the word \u201cOlympic\u201d to be used in the park name, the legacy company had committed to help it attract major sporting events to the stadium.\n\nThe disconnect between the professed desire for an athletics legacy and the reluctance to underwrite it cuts to the heart of the problem. Athletics is the centrepiece of the Olympics but it is not commercially viable in its own right.\n\nEven the World Championships lose money, relying on state and city governments to underwrite losses as the price of the global attention they bring.\n\nEd Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, has argued that the 2015 bid makes sense because it will help bring to life the Olympic legacy promise. To have a chance of beating Beijing, however, his bid needs government support to underwrite the \u00a345 million staging costs and to share losses that could reach \u00a325 million.\n\nOn Thursday Roberston ruled out sharing any losses. \u201cWe are not shutting the door on underwriting the staging costs and provide other guarantees, but they [UKA] will not get a cheque to make up the shortfall if the event makes a loss.

West Ham's bid is for a multi-use stadium that includes athletics.\n\n\"What has impressed me so much about the joint bid from West Ham and Newham is their clear commitment to the spirit of the Olympic legacy and not just athletics at the elite end, but with the retention of the community track, our future champions and club runners too,\" said Warner.\n\n\"It was clear from the start that only a partnership approach would bring to life the vision Seb Coe had when he committed to an athletics legacy in 2005 and we believe the collaboration of West Ham, Newham and UKA gives the strongest opportunity for a vibrant sporting legacy that will go well beyond 2012.\"\n\n\"We believe ours is the only bid that can deliver London's legacy commitment to the International Olympic Committee,\" she said. \"UKA's endorsement is a powerful and highly-valued testament of that.\"\n\nBaroness Ford, chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, confirmed last week that the stadium would have to retain an athletics track after 2012.\n\nThe company hopes to make a decision on who will be the main tenant by December.\n\nMeanwhile Hugh Brasher, the son of London Marathon co-founder Chris, is to succeed David Bedford as race director of the 29-year-old event when the former 10,000 metres world record-holder stands down in three years' time.\n\nBrasher, who has been a director of the annual race from Blackheath to The Mall for the past two years, will take over in a structured changeover, acting as deputy race director next year, joint race director with Bedford in 2012 before assuming sole responsibility in 2013, when Bedford will switch to a part-time role.\n\nBedford, 61, said: \"Hugh Brasher, through his business experience in sporting events and understanding of the sport from every angle, was head and shoulders above the other applicants.\"", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01727/stadium_1727093c.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01727/stadium_1727093a.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01727/stadium_1727093a.jpg", "date": "11/10/2010"}, "rank_245": {"title": "London Olympic Business: British companies could miss Olympic benefits", "text": "A new Deloitte report found that over two thirds of companies in the UK expect no impact on their operations from the Olympics. Only half expect to see any increase in demand for their services during the Games.\n\nAccording to the survey, more than half of businesses in tourism, hospital and leisure expect \"virtually no impact\" from London holding the Games, despite 10m tickets being on sale for the Olympics and Paralympics. Meanwhile, more than 70pc of retailers expect no impact.\n\nRick Cudworth, head of business continuity and resilience at Deloitte, said: \"Many of these businesses need a wake-up call. They operate in service industries where people are vital, where the supply chain is time critical, where having products on the shelf or food to serve in restaurants is essential to their daily business. Thinking through the impacts that an Olympic-scale event could have on logistics, the supply of goods and the movement of staff is essential.\"\n\nDeloitte's Games Readiness report found that even in London, 60pc of businesses expect only a minimal impact from the Games, despite the potential disruption to transport and accommodation, and potential shortages of catering and security services. Only 7pc fear a lack of hotel availability, and 8pc a disruption to supplies.\n\nNigel Bourne, the CBI's London director, warned there needs to be an \"education\" with businesses about how to financially benefit from the Games and prepare for potential disruption. He said that demand on London's transport network during the six-week period that the Olympics and Paralympics are held will be \"far greater than anything we have seen\".\n\n\"I would urge businesses to start looking at these things now rather than at the end of 2011,\" he said. The CBI is holding regular meetings with its members about the Olympics, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is also preparing a package on travel that it will distribute to companies.\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said the Government was \"working closely with existing business networks, such as CBI and FSB, to ensure that British firms maximise the opportunities created by the Games\". He added: \"These networks have also been used to consult with companies about possible short-term impacts on trading at Games-time and how to maintain business as usual.\"\n\nConcerns about the preparedness of companies comes just days after figures from the ODA also called into question how widespread the economic benefits of the Games would be to the UK. Out of the 1,300 tier-one contracts worth \u00a35.2bn for the construction of the venues, Welsh companies have won just \u00a3574,000 of work, the equivalent of 0.01pc. Meanwhile, Scottish groups have won just 0.43pc and Northern Irish 0.33pc.\n\nThe figures prompted criticism of the Welsh Government \u2013 which admitted it was \"disappointed\" over the lack of deals \u2013 about its efforts to help companies secure contracts, although the ODA has stressed that companies in the country have won work from the 70,000 contracts generated through the supply chain.\n\nMr Bourne, however, believes that the UK economy will still enjoy widespread benefits from the Games. The CBI backed London's bid to host the Olympics, believing there will be a boost not only from tourism but the \"international promotion\" of London and the UK, a sentiment backed by 92pc of business in a recent survey.\n\n\"If you look at other Olympic cities who have done a good job of staging the games, such as Barcelona and Sydney, they have been transformed,\" he added. \"Businesses outside London have already benefited from winning contracts and I think businesses will also benefit from spending by people coming into the UK or from their community. We all hope that people who come to visit the Games will also spend some time in other parts of the UK. There will also be the knock-on effects from the various training camps.\"\n\nIn the Deloitte survey, although only half of businesses said they expect an increase in demand, 20pc expected a strong increase. Also, a quarter of the 200 large companies surveyed \u2013 which employ more than 500 people \u2013 have appointed an individual or group to assess the potential opportunities and disruptions from the Games. At BAA, for example, Danny Sloan is 2012 director. He is in charge of preparing for the huge influx of passengers that the company's airports will see during the Games, including the athletes themselves.\n\nHowever, Heather Hancock, the London 2012 partner at Deloitte, warned: \"There is a disconnect in that many businesses are expecting to see an increase in demand for their services but are not planning or thinking about what they need to do in order to secure that extra business. They should recognise that their competitors will be, and in some cases already are, planning for this upturn. Relying on an assumption that demand will increase automatically could leave them out in the cold come 2012.\"", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01683/beach-volleyball_1683739a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01859/olystad5_1859676g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03562/FDetox_Shopping_85_3562706g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03575/City_of_London_3575797g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01860/oly-stad_1860505g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01871/olympics_1871968g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03554/dudley1_3554550g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01720/olympic2_1720663c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03568/Financial_Detox__h_3568618g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01861/getty-olympic_1861733g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01683/beach-volleyball_1683739a.jpg", "date": "15/10/2010"}, "rank_113": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: Government accused of 'devastating' legacy with school spending cuts", "text": "While the \u00a39.3 billion budget for hosting the Games was left almost untouched by the Comprehensive Spending Review, cutbacks in school sport provision have raised questions over whether the country will be able deliver on the promise made by Sebastian Coe during the 2012 bidding process to use the Olympics and Paralympics to inspire a new generation of young people to take up sport.\n\nThe Department of Education announced it was axing the entire \u00a3162 million PE and Sports Strategy, which was introduced by the previous Labour administration with the aim of proving five hours of high-quality sport for all five to 16 year-olds. The five-hour target is being withdrawn.\n\nIn addition, a network of 450 school sports partnerships set up across the country and administered by the Youth Sport Trust to forge sporting links between schools and local clubs is to be scrapped.\n\nIt was also announced that the Government would no longer provide ring-fenced funding for the country's 3,000 specialist schools, many of which are sporting academies, offering a saving of \u00a3450 million for 2010-11.\n\nIvan Lewis, the shadow Culture, Media and Sports Secretary, said: \"At a time when we are preparing to host the Olympics, bidding for the World Cup and fighting an obesity crisis, this dismantling of support for school sport is perverse and short-sighted.\n\n\"It will hit disadvantaged young people the hardest and makes a mockery of our commitment to deliver an Olympic legacy.\"\n\nBaroness Sue Campbell, who is chairman of the YST and UK Sport, described the axing of the PE and Sports Strategy as \"devastating news\", claiming more than a million young people had been introduced to competitive sport in the past three years through the school sport partnerships.\n\nSteve Grainger, the YST chief executive, said: \"With just 21 months to go until the start of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, Lord Coe's pledge to use the Games to transform sporting opportunities for young people is now hanging in the balance.\"\n\nThe Department of Culture, Media and Sport has also suffered a substantial cut to its funding, with cash earmarked for Sport England, which distributes funds for sport at community level, set to be reduced by 33 per cent over four years.\n\nSport England will consult the national governing bodies before deciding where the axe will fall in revenue funding and capital expenditure.\n\nUK Sport, which looks after elite sport, faces a 28 per cent cut, though there will be no reduction in support for Olympic and Paralympic athletes until after the 2012 Games.\n\nBoth Sport England and UK Sport have been cushioned from the full impact of the cutbacks by an increase in Lottery funding over the next four years, with sport's share of the overall Lottery pot rising to 20 per cent from 13.7 per cent from 2012 onwards.\n\nThe two organisations have committed to reduce their administration costs by 50 per cent by March 2015. The two bodies will be merged by April 1, 2013.\n\nThe budget for hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games remains largely intact, with the \u00a31.1 billion contingency fund also preserved.\n\nHugh Robertson, the Sports Minister, said: \"This is a straightforward government commitment to what we won in 2005. It's also a reflection of the fact that the building project is now 70 per cent complete.\n\nHe added: \"In terms of the way that the project has been managed, it has already delivered \u00a3740 million in savings so the project has been well managed up to now.

He won gold in both and set a 200m world record.\n\nBut, according to insiders, no such favour has been accorded to Ennis, the world and European heptathlon champion and also a world-class performer in the sprint hurdles.\n\nThe draft timetable for the 2012 Games, which has recently been finalised, allows Ennis a mere 36 hours' recovery time between events, making it almost impossible for her to contemplate the heptathlon-hurdles double.\n\nAn identical gap between the two events at last year's World Championships in Berlin proved too tight for the Sheffield athlete, who was forced to pull out of the hurdles on the eve of competition because she was still exhausted after her gruelling heptathlon victory.\n\nLast night, Minichiello conceded that the gap between the events in London was probably too short to attempt the double.\n\n\"It's incredibly tight,\" he said. \"Because it's the same as the Berlin timetable, it's probably too tight. I don't want to rule it out because I need to have a discussion with Jess. It's certainly something we'll still consider but I'm not sure. It might just be too tight.\"\n\nThe athletics timetable for London has been drawn up by Locog, the International Association of Athletics Federations and the Olympic Broadcast Service and is due to be signed off by the IAAF at its council meeting in Monaco next month.\n\nDetails of the schedule are being kept under wraps until then but The Daily Telegraph has learnt that the two-day heptathlon competition will take place on the first two days of athletics competition, beginning on the morning of Friday, Aug 3, and finishing with the last of the seven events, the 800m, on the evening of Aug 4. The opening round of the women's sprint hurdles is scheduled for Aug 6.\n\nThe night of Aug 4, when Ennis will be the overwhelming favourite to clinch Britain's first athletics gold medal, is certain to be one of the hottest tickets of the Games since it will also feature the second round of the men's 100m.\n\nThe showpiece men's 100m final, for which tickets will cost up to \u00a3725, is due to take place on Sunday, Aug 5. For triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt, the schedule will be more condensed than it was at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, when the 100m final took place on the Saturday evening.\n\nEnnis may get another chance to win an Olympic medal if she is selected for the 4x100m relay, having already been sounded out about running the first leg by GB women's relay coach, Tony Lester. The first round is due to take place on Aug 9.\n\nBut the short gap between the heptathlon and hurdles will be a bitter blow for the 24 year-old, who is certain to be one of the poster girls for 2012. Earlier this week she was shortlisted for the IAAF World Athlete of the Year award following her pentathlon victory at the World Indoor Championships in Doha in March and her heptathlon triumph at the European Championships in Barcelona.\n\nAs well as reigning supreme in multi-events competition, Ennis also believes that, with continued improvement over the next couple of seasons, she could be challenging for a medal in the individual hurdles by the time of the Olympics.\n\nShe began this year by setting a British record of 7.95sec in the 60m hurdles in Glasgow, beating American world indoor champion Lolo Jones in the process.\n\nHer personal best over 100m of 12.81sec would have got her to the Olympic final in Beijing, though she missed out on the Games after suffering stress fractures in her right foot.\n\nIn May this year, Ennis said she hoped organisers would do all they could to allow her to double up in London and make the most of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of competing at a home Olympics.\n\n\"I hope they'll be able to pull a few strings to let it happen,\" she said. \"If the timetable did permit and I keep on improving, then I'd love to do it.\"\n\nJessica's highs and lows\n\n2005: Heptathlon gold, European Junior Championships, Kaunas.\n\n2006: Heptathlon bronze, Commonwealth Games, Melbourne.\n\n2008: Suffered multiple stress fractures in right foot midway through Gotzis Meeting, ruling her out of Beijing Olympics.\n\n2009: Heptathlon gold, World Championships, Berlin.\n\n2010: Pentathlon gold, World Indoor Championships, Doha; heptathlon gold, European Championships, Barcelona.", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01744/jessica-ennis_1744442a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01744/jessica-ennis_1744442c.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01744/jessica-ennis_1744442a.jpg", "date": "22/10/2010"}, "rank_255": {"title": "London abandons bid for 2015 World Athletics Championships", "text": "The decision leaves Beijing as the sole bidders for 2015 and the Chinese capital should be confirmed as hosts by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) on November 20.\n\nThe Government were unable to commit to backing a 2015 bid because a number of the tenders for the 2012 stadium - including Tottenham's - have plans that would see the running track removed.\n\nMinisters feared if they committed to a bid for 2015 with the stadium as the centre-piece they would be open to legal action.\n\nIt is understood the decision to bid instead for 2017 has been made with the blessing of the IAAF.\n\nSports minister Hugh Robertson said he was now very hopeful the Government would underwrite the 2017 bid.\n\nRobertson said: \"That is still to be completely confirmed but I would be very disappointed if that were not the case.\"\n\nThe minister said the biggest danger would have been to make a bid and then pull out at a later date, as happened in 2001 when the then Government pulled out of London's Picketts Lock hosting the 2005 championships.\n\nRobertson added: \"The crucial thing was to avoid the collateral damage we suffered with Picketts Lock.\"\n\nEd Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, said: \"Obviously we are disappointed not to be pursuing our 2015 bid, especially after securing the support of both the Government and the Mayor of London.\n\n\"However, we need to present the IAAF with a bid that is free of any uncertainties.\n\n\"That is not something we can commit to until the process regarding the future of the stadium, which we fully support, is concluded.\n\n\"Our bid is, in my opinion, an excellent one and one that can deliver an outstanding championships for the IAAF.

At one stage it looked like it was going to be completely the other way around which was definitely a big problem \u2013 there are a lot of crashes in BMX and I never hold back so I know the GB management were concerned about that and the challenge in the Team Sprint being affected if I was selected and then got injured on the BMX track.\n\n\"So the dream of chasing two gold medals in different sports is alive but it is going to be very difficult. Just getting into the GB Team Sprint team as the lead off rider for Vicky Pendleton is going to be a major challenge because Jess Varnish is going really well and getting stronger with every ride.\n\n\"For the time being I am not even going to think that selection issue, we all need to concentrate first on reaching the level of performance needled to win the gold medal, selection can take care of itself later. what I need to do now is to make some major inroads into my personal best for that first lap.\n\n\"The Australians are almost certainly going to be the team to beat and their leadoff girl Kaarle McCulloch is doing opening laps of 18.5 which is a fir bit quick than my best from a couple of years ago is 19 seconds. I'm off the track for another month at least with a wrist injury, I have just had the plaster off, and as soon as I get back that will be my focus, to get that time down.\n\n\"In one way BMX and track sprinting are closely related \u2013 you need fast leg speed and explosive power \u2013 but in other ways they are very different. The aerodynamics are completely different, your position on the bike is very different and you use different muscles in your back and your butt. When I do a big block of track training, after switching from BMX, I am always sore for the first two or three weeks as I readjust.\n\n\"I am going to try and address that this summer, when I am back on the BMX circuit, by making a strong commitment to doing one day's training on the track wherever I am in the world, just to keep ticking over on that side of things. It won't be easy but in the long term it has to be done.\n\n\"On the track its still on the technique side of things that I have work do to. Physically I score very well on all our tests, I have explosive power and plenty of endurance from the longer BMX races, so I have got to fine tune my pure sprinting technique.\n\n\"My wrist injury means I can't be considered for any of the first two World Cup meetings in December but I am not going to fret, the bigger picture is being at a new level for 2012. I should be back in full swing by early January and am hoping for a good ride at the Manchester World Cup and then we will see what the situation is with the World Championships.\"\n\nLooking beyond 2012 you sense that Reade may be contemplating a more permanent switch to the track. With Pendleton widely expected to retire after London, there will be a vacancy as Great Britain's 'Golden girl' and although BMX has a loyal following and Reade enjoys cult status it remains very much a niche sport. In contrast Track cycling is now virtually mainstream with Great Britain's biggest stars becoming household names.\n\nAbove all else there is the attraction of competing in the Keirin which will become an Olympic event for the first time in London. If ever a rider was born to ride their Keirin it would seem to be Reade.\n\n\"I have always loved watching it, the Keirin in a real battle and reminds me a great deal of some of our BMX races. Its about speed and guts and tactics and looks great fun. You can't do it all at once and I have got enough on my plate at the moment but after London I would like to have a serious go at the Keirin and maybe the Individiual sprint as well.\"\n\nHoliday Inn has introduced a programme to support up to 50 emerging and established British athletes by providing over 1,500 free nights at hotels across the IHG brand family worldwide.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01763/Reade_1763865c.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01803/Brendan_Gallagher__1803701j.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01763/Reade2_1763864a.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01763/Reade2_1763864c.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01763/Reade2_1763864a.jpg", "date": "17/11/2010"}, "rank_157": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: Tottenham stadium victory 'would be a betrayal of Olympic legacy'", "text": "Tottenham face competition from West Ham to inherit the stadium after the 2012 Games, with the Upton Park club, backed by Newham Council, long considered the frontrunners because of their commitment to meeting the Olympic promise of an athletics legacy by retaining the track inside the stadium.\n\nThat commitment has won the support of Ed Warner, chairman of UK Athletics, but the increasing seriousness and financial strength of Tottenham\u2019s bid has prompted concerns that the athletics legacy promised by Lord Coe in London\u2019s Olympic bid may be compromised.\n\nTottenham and their partners AEG, which owns and operates the O2, have said they will rip out the athletics track after the Games and build a new stadium on the site, but they are yet to articulate what alternative they will offer athletics. Warner believes that given the strength of the West Ham proposal, they will not be able to compete.\n\n\u201cWe have come down in support of the West Ham-Newham bid for very good reasons,\u201d he told Telegraph Sport . \u201cIt ticks all the boxes in terms of the legacy for athletics, both at an elite level and in the community. I cannot conceive of an athletics legacy that Tottenham can come up with that would be acceptable given that West Ham would give us the ability to stage the championships and make the stadium the iconic home of British athletics in the long-term.\n\n\u201cIt is a very credible bid that follows the legacy promise London made to the IOC in the long term and anything less than their offer would be a capitulation and would be to renege on the promise we made when the Games were awarded.\u201d\n\nWarner\u2019s disquiet over the athletics legacy betrays the growing conviction in Olympic circles that far from being a fall-back position for Tottenham in the event of complications with their existing development plans in Haringey, the Stratford site could become their favoured option. Spurs\u2019 interest has hardened in recent months after the cost of their favoured new stadium development adjacent to White Hart Lane increased by at least \u00a350 million because of planning and development issues.\n\nThere is a belief within the club board that the Olympic Stadium site offers a viable and potentially cheaper alternative. The Spurs bid is now described by sources close to the process as \u201cdeadly serious\u201d.\n\n\u201cSome people have said that the Olympic bid is just a means of getting leverage over Haringey, but the club is committed to running this process in parallel with that development. If they are successful in winning the bid for Stratford they will have to make a decision, but it is deadly serious,\u201d said a source with direct knowledge of the deliberations.\n\nTottenham have hired investment bank Goldman Sachs as advisers in negotiations that will open with the Olympic Park Legacy Company on Monday.\n\nIn a sign of the club\u2019s interest Sir Keith Mills, deputy chairman of the London 2012 organising committee and a non-executive director at Tottenham, has absented himself from Olympic board meetings until the issue is settled to avoid any conflict of interest. Tottenham\u2019s ultimate owner, Joe Lewis, the billionaire speculator, is also understood to have taken an interest in the project.\n\nThe club are yet to articulate their athletics legacy but are understood to have been in touch with Warner in recent days, and are said to be considering a number of options. These are thought to include revisiting the possibility of redeveloping the Crystal Palace site, an option rejected previously.\n\nWhile Tottenham\u2019s bid is weak on legacy it is considered financially strong. \u201cTottenham would score 10 out of 10 on finance but nought out of 10 on legacy, while West Ham get 10 out of 10 on legacy and do less well on finance,\u201d said one source.\n\nThe OPLC\u2019s tender documents make it clear that long-term financial viability is a prerequisite for the successful bidder, and Tottenham believe they can offer a more attractive offer than West Ham.\n\nWest Ham counter that they have a robust proposal that would mean Newham Council borrowing less than \u00a380 million, secured against football club revenue, to fund the transformation of the stadium. The key to winning the bid, however, will be convincing the OPLC and the Government that their bid is viable in the long term, even if the club are relegated this season.\n\nWest Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said she had no doubt it would. \u201cIt is ridiculous to say that just because we are bottom of the league our bid is less strong than Tottenham\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cNewham will borrow the money and we will pay it back at a rate we can afford, whether we are in the Premier League or the Championship. We have modelled both situations and we can afford it. This is not an arrogant football club coming along to write a cheque, this is about a proper legacy and that is what we are going to deliver.\u201d\n\nThe key to West Ham securing a stadium they have eyed for five years rests in their proving that the financial case stacks up in the long term, avoiding any future call on the public purse.\n\nIf they do that, given the commitment to an Olympic legacy that all the key decision makers, including London mayor Boris Johnson and culture secretary Jeremy Hunt have endorsed, it will be hard to refuse.\n\nHead to head: how the rival bids compare\n\n\u00bbWest Ham\n\nAim: Convert Olympic stadium into a 60,000 seat stadium that will retain the running track and be long-term home for British athletics as well as venue for future World and European Championships.

The Games are attended by the rich and famous, government leaders and by senior representatives of global and national companies. It is a great opportunity to make friends and influence people, leading to lucrative business arrangements.\n\nFor the London 2012 Olympic Games, \u00a3700m of official sponsorship money has already been paid to Locog, the organising committee, by top global and UK companies through a tiered programme of sponsorship. This is a significant element of the commercial revenue derived from the Games, along with ticket and merchandise sales.\n\nIn addition, the opportunities for these companies for corporate entertainment are endless in the run-up to, during and in the aftermath of the Games.\n\nIt is estimated that \u00a3100m will be spent on events and hospitality during London 2012.\n\nIndividual countries are already setting up respective \"houses\" in and around London. This will be the centre of activities for athletes, sponsors and businessmen during the Olympics.\n\nHowever, businesses, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the London 2012 organisers, will need to give due consideration to the The UK Bribery Act. This Act comes into effect from April 1, 2011. This will mean that certain types of corporate hospitality and gifts may be considered a bribe and may be illegal. The penalties can include unlimited fines and heavy prison sentences for both employees and companies.\n\nSentences may be up to 10 years for the individual staff members, and organisations involved may be heavily fined. Additionally, company directors who may be found to have consented or be involved will be liable for the offence.\n\nThe offences include offering or receiving financial or other advantage, bribing or corrupting a foreign public official and the new and largely undefined corporate offences. However, we do know that the new corporate offences will include when a person associated with a company bribes another person for the benefit of said company. The company in question will be found to have committed a bribe.\n\nShould a potential case arise, the only defence of the organisation is to show that it had adequate procedures in place to stop bribery. These procedures will not be fully defined until early 2011.\n\nThe Act includes all organisations incorporated in the UK, or undertaking all or part of its business in the UK. The Act, therefore, has both a domestic element and global reach into foreign companies with UK interests which may see the Games as a great opportunity to influence current and potential customers, suppliers and business partners.\n\nThe cost of compliance for UK corporates is likely to be high. Many are already revising arrangements to address the Act. Companies will need to review their policies, procedures and budgets for corporate entertaining to ensure employees stay within the law. In the run-up to the Act, companies need to establish internal policies, train staff, delegate responsibility for bribery monitoring, assess the risks of bribery and corruption and set internal disciplinary sanctions. All of this will obviously come at a cost to UK businesses.\n\nCurrent guidance suggests that business lunches are reasonable but lavish corporate events may lead to undue influence, and there remain many grey areas. The Olympics, coming so soon after the Act is introduced, will surely be the ultimate test for this rigorous Act.\n\nJohn Abbott is head of governance, risk and assurance at accountant RSM Tenon", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01787/olympics_1787205a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01859/olystad5_1859676g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03562/FDetox_Shopping_85_3562706g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03575/City_of_London_3575797g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01860/oly-stad_1860505g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01871/olympics_1871968g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01787/olympics_1787205c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03554/dudley1_3554550g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03568/Financial_Detox__h_3568618g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01861/getty-olympic_1861733g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01787/olympics_1787205a.jpg", "date": "17/12/2010"}, "rank_177": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: Tottenham's plans to demolish and rebuild stadium on agenda at IOC meeting", "text": "The north London club, who are vying with West Ham to take over the Olympic Stadium after 2012, made public their ambitious plans to demolish the existing structure in Stratford, east London, and replace it with a new 60,000-seat venue capable of hosting Premier League football and concerts staged by entertainments giant AEG.\n\nBut, crucially, the club have confirmed that there will be no place in the new stadium for an athletics track.

One cannot avoid the suspicion that Coe and his cohorts regard the \u2018500 days\u2019 watershed in the same way Sharpe sees 1,000: namely, not solely as a number, but as a \u201ctotal game-changer\u201d.\n\nIs the notion of time going backwards from 2012 really so fanciful, either? Has it escaped wider notice that the inert London clock has 500 days, seven hours, six minutes and 56 seconds still to elapse? Suddenly, retrograde is all the rage.\n\nWatching Twenty Twelve, we are supposed to be transported to a crazed parallel universe where no one can tell the difference between Duffy, middle-of-the-road chanteuse, and Carol Ann Duffy, Poet Laureate.\n\nIn these alternative Olympics, Gok Wan is identified as a national hero, and Peter Andre appointed chief torchbearer.\n\nBut then no indulgence appears too extreme for the Games\u2019 real-life organisers, whose perceptions of Britishness \u2014 if the performance in Beijing is any gauge \u2014 involves Leona Lewis and Jimmy Page in duet atop a Routemaster bus.\n\nThe show is equally piercing on that vexed subject of Olympic legacy. One beautiful scene forces Kay Hope, the hapless \u2018head of sustainability\u2019, to explain to a youth group leader in Stoke Newington that London\u2019s hockey arena is being redeveloped into \u201cUrban Duck World\u201d.\n\nLikewise, the taekwondo venue is being touted, post-2012, as a national indoor donkey sanctuary.\n\nIt is a novel thought: maybe, given all that unseemly human squabbling between Tottenham and West Ham over rights to the Olympic Stadium, we should just hand everything over to the animals.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02817/oliver-brown_2817670j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01850/omega-clock_1850150a.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01850/omega-clock_1850150a.jpg", "date": "16/03/2011"}, "rank_229": {"title": "Budget's Enterprise Zone is vital to an Olympic legacy of prosperity", "text": "SIR \u2013 We welcome the announcement in the Budget of new Enterprise Zones. The new zone in London will be in the Royal Docks. It is crucial that the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games bring sustainable employment to East London as part of a lasting legacy. Newham alone has an employment rate of 60 per cent of the working age population \u2013 10 percentage points below the national average. But East London has the potential to contribute an additional \u00a313 billion to GDP.\n\nWe must ensure that we get the incentives right for each area, to maximise investment potential. Last year, the Prime Minister announced his plan for a tech city, stretching from Old Street to the Olympic Park. We look forward to working with the Government to maximise the opportunities for technology to drive our economy.\n\nKevin Murphy\n\nChief Executive, ExCeL London\n\nRichard Gooding\n\nChairman, London City Airport\n\nHamid Kefayati\n\nManaging Director, Buhler Sortex Limited\n\nSIR \u2013 I wish the Chancellor had increased the tax on everything I don't buy and increased income tax for everyone who earns more than I do.\n\nRodney Howlett\n\nDarley Dale, Derbyshire\n\nSIR \u2013 How refreshing to have a Budget largely free of hubris and sleight-of-hand.\n\nMartin Moyes\n\nHolt, Wiltshire\n\nSIR \u2013 With so many announcements made in advance of the Budget, what was the point of the speech?\n\nIn 1947, when Hugh Dalton, then chancellor, revealed tax details in an off-the-cuff remark to a journalist ahead of delivering his autumn Budget, he resigned.\n\nMichael J. Hawes\n\nNewark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire\n\nSIR \u2013 Ed Miliband and Ed Balls tell us that the increase in VAT is going to cost the average family an extra \u00a3400 per year. For the 2.5 per cent increase to cost me \u00a3400, I would have to spend \u00a316,000 on VAT-able items in a year, which seems unlikely.\n\nC. H. Thorp\n\nBridgend, Glamorgan\n\nSIR \u2013 Hearing the Leader of the Opposition refer to \"one pence\" yesterday afternoon, brought to the forefront the question of what we call our coinage. Would everybody start referring to pence rather than \"pee\", which is best left in the lavatory?\n\nRobert Pugh\n\nCarmarthen\n\nSIR \u2013 I would like to thank the Chancellor for giving a helping hand to smokers in these difficult times. With the high tax on cigarettes in Britain, I easily covered the cost of two holidays a year by buying my cigarettes in another EU country. With the Budget's additional increase in tax, I can add a weekend city break at no extra cost.\n\nPeter Iden\n\nTotnes, Devon\n\nFinish the job in Libya\n\nSIR \u2013 Machiavelli got it right. He advised that if you are going to antagonise a tyrant, you have no choice but to finish the job. If you leave the tyrant only partly damaged, he will come back with a terrible revenge.\n\nColonel Muammar Gaddafi will never forgive this country for what we have done. We have no choice, therefore, but to finish what we started. The only way will be covertly to train and equip the insurrection to sweep back out of the east and take the coast up to and through Tripoli. The rebels had almost achieved that a month ago.\n\nChances of success? Let us recall that when the insurrection was advancing, Gaddafi\u2019s so-called loyalists were defecting, tribe by tribe and unit by unit. They say along that coast that you cannot buy the loyalty of a Libyan, but you can usually rent it.\n\nAnd we used to do \u201ccovert\u201d rather well.\n\nFrederick Forsyth\n\nBeaconsfield, Buckinghamshire\n\nSIR \u2013 People should not condemn the American pilot who strafed the Libyans approaching the downed airman (report, March 23). Any wingman worth his salt would put down covering fire to safeguard his colleague. It would have been impossible to know whether the parachute descent was into friendly or unfriendly hands.\n\nHuw Baumgartner\n\nBridell, Pembrokeshire\n\nSIR \u2013 Gaddafi seized power when King Idris was holidaying in Turkey. Forty-one years later, Turkey, a secular state with a Muslim majority, has experienced military rule and is in a unique position to negotiate a settlement of the Libyan \u201cwar\u201d. An offer of asylum to Gaddafi from Turkey may save more Libyan lives than continuing to unleash our military hardware. Turkey, moreover, has an army capable of providing the boots on the ground.\n\nJohn E.

This is why more than 5,000 GP practices have signed up to test the plans.\n\nDr Ken Aswani\n\nLondon E4\n\nTricks at the till\n\nSir \u2013 Short-changing, which was common in the 1950s, appears to be back. One trick then was for a shopkeeper to leave a tin of evaporated milk sitting on the counter. Every likely mug was charged for it and, if challenged, the till operator would apologise for the \u201cmistake\u201d, saying the item must have been left there by a previous customer.\n\nToday, I find the till display is frequently obscured, so that you only realise you have been short-changed when you examine your receipt. When you complain, you are often asked if you mind them serving the next customer, so that they can correct it without opening the till. This avoids it being noticed on the till records.\n\nBrian Gilbert\n\nHampton, Middlesex\n\nMysterious hole in one\n\nSIR \u2013 Why is it that on whichever foot one puts a sock with a toe hole, the hole is always where the big toe is?\n\nRichard J.G. Waldron\n\nWoolavington, Somerset\n\nBBC looks North\n\nSIR \u2013 The BBC has moved on since Trevor Taylor worked on the Today programme in the 1970s (Letters, March 21).\n\nDavid Cameron was interviewed on BBC Radio Manchester after the leadership debate, and it was from a Manchester studio that Gordon Brown apologised after his comments about Gillian Duffy.\n\nEd Miliband and Andy Burnham appeared on Stephen Nolan\u2019s show on Radio 5 Live and Ben Bradshaw and Kate Hoey joined Stephen for a live broadcast from Salford.\n\nNumerous politicians and opinion formers from the North enrich the national debate from our Manchester offices. Bear in mind also that most senior politicians are interviewed \u201cdown the line\u201d from Millbank and rarely travel to west London.\n\nThe BBC is moving 2,300 posts to MediaCityUK in Salford, moving departments and output to a new base in the North of England to reflect our audience better, to spread the licence fee more equitably and to be part of the future of the region; this is more ambitious than creating a branch office outside the M25.\n\nPeter Salmon\n\nDirector, BBC North\n\nSalford\n\nClassified information\n\nSIR \u2013 A friend was once chatted up on the dance floor (\u201cOnly members of the middle classes pretend that they\u2019re not\u201d, March 22). She was asked what social class she belonged to. The man had no hope with a chat-up line like that, but her answer was perfect: \u201cI\u2019m in a class of my own.\u201d\n\nVivienne Howse\n\nLondon N12\n\nSIR \u2013 My great-grandfather was a pit blacksmith/farrier who could barely sign his name and only read the Bible. I worked for the Great Western Railway for 37 years. People who think themselves middle class are deluding themselves; if you sell your labour to feed your family, no matter whether you\u2019re a barrister or a bootboy, you are a worker and therefore working class.\n\nMichael Roberts\n\nEvesham, Worcestershire\n\nTearing off a sheet\n\nSIR \u2013 My rowing coach said the catch at the start of a stroke should be like tearing a sheet of paper from a loo roll (Letters, March 22): too aggressive and it rips, not sufficiently sharp and it unrolls. I suspect he envisaged the loose end at the front.\n\nGeorge Atkinson-Clark\n\nLidlington, Bedfordshire\n\nStatisticians need to get their numbers straight\n\nSIR \u2013 In another example of incompetence within government, the Office for National Statistics is displaying posters in bus shelters and elsewhere which bear the legend: \u201cComplete your census online or drop it in the post today to avoid a fine.\u201d\n\nYet the census questionnaire exhorts us to complete it \u201con March 27, 2011, or as soon as possible afterwards\u201d.\n\nIf the Office for National Statistics can\u2019t get its dates right, what hope have we got for an accurate census?\n\nChristopher Martin\n\nWinchester, Hampshire\n\nSIR \u2013 When I worked on the 1991 census, in response to the question \u201chow do you fill your working day?\u201d, a cleaning lady wrote: \u201cI fill my day hovering and moping.\u201d\n\nDiana Stevenson\n\nSaltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01469/let_1469501g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02777/lloyd-george_2777768g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03188/Homepage_Politics__3188625e.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01964/socialMedia_puff_3_1964870a.jpg"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraphFacebook.jpg", "date": "24/03/2011"}, "rank_241": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: time lapse of Olympic stadium turf being laid", "text": "- 80,000 capacity in Games mode and designed to be flexible enough to accommodate a number of different legacy requirements and capacities in legacy\n\n- The Stadium hosts the Opening and Closing ceremonies as well as the Athletics track and field events\n\n- The Stadium is visible across the Park from all approaches and will be the centre piece for the 2012 Games.\n\n- The total Stadium island site covers an area of 40 acres - it is compact and surrounded by water on three sides.\n\n- Five major new bridges will lead spectators into the site, provide spectacular views across the Park and London\n\n- The shape of the Stadium is an ellipse with a long axis of 315 meters and a short axis of 256 meters.

From the 2012 logo by the front gate, past the photos of Olympians in the corridors, to the pupil-penned Olympic-themed limericks framed on the walls, nobody could accuse this establishment of missing the significance of what will be happening down the road next July and August.\n\n\u201cWhy on earth would we wish to ignore it?\u201d says Sue Ponulak, the school\u2019s director of sport. \u201cThis is going to be the biggest thing in our lifetime, let\u2019s celebrate it, let\u2019s use it, let's embrace it. And let\u2019s hope we can follow through with it.\u201d\n\nSitting with four of the school\u2019s pupils last week, the excitement was already palpable. The talk was of Usain Bolt being in this very neighbourhood next summer, of youthful competitors attempting to emulate his style at the school sports day, of, across the school, a rush to run, jump and throw. And this despite the fact that nobody knows anyone who managed to secure tickets.\n\n\u201cI applied for the badminton, but didn\u2019t get any,\u201d says 13 year-old Tom Long, who plays badminton in the gym every evening after school. \u201cI met Gail Emms last year at a tournament. It seems ridiculous, but when you meet her, given what she\u2019s achieved, it\u2019s kind of amazing to discover she is an ordinary person. It inspires you to think you might do what she\u2019s done, too.\u201d\n\nAt Bacon\u2019s, the alma mater of David Haye, sport is central to the curriculum. In addition to four periods of timetabled physical education, Feyi Shonde, for instance, takes part in after-school clubs every night of the week in term time, where she is coached in football, netball and athletics.\n\nOn the school\u2019s freshly-installed floodlit artificial pitch, Sergei Baltacha, the father of tennis player Elena and a former Soviet international, runs a football academy in partnership with Fulham FC. Last week, 40 of the school\u2019s pupils were on a basketball camp in Croatia.\n\nThe importance of sport - physically, emotionally, educationally - is understood here. And with the Games just a year away, even those disinclined to engage in anything physical have been getting the Olympic bug.\n\n\u201cIt would be an exaggeration to say we\u2019ll get everyone off the sofa,\u201d says Ms Ponulak. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got a programme here for 15, 16-year-old girls to train after school, using dance, that\u2019s really getting people involved who wouldn\u2019t otherwise.\n\n\"I\u2019m not denying there\u2019s a bribe involved with a nice new T-shirt for everyone who turns up. But you use anything you can. And the Olympics are the best encouragement we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nThe question facing teachers like Ms Ponulak, however, is what happens afterwards, in 2013 and beyond. In the build-up to next summer\u2019s unforgettable fortnight, there is no doubt excitement will generate a surge of activity. Sustaining that is the challenge.\n\n\u201cIt could be the greatest thing to happen to us. I say could be, But only if we back it up properly,\u201d says Ms Ponulak. \"I know you can\u2019t predict, but I fear for the money post-2012.\n\n\"It would be hard politically to cut programmes in the run up to the games, easy afterwards. And at the moment the funding for the bottom of the pyramid is held together with sticky tape.\u201d\n\nMs Ponulak points to the ending of the School Sport Partnerships as characteristic of the lack of commitment to sustained investment.\n\n\u201cIt was a world-class initiative in identifying talent,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Australians studied it and decided to start their own version. Just as we get rid of ours.\u201d\n\nAt Bacon\u2019s, too, the school tried to build a basketball centre to be used as a training facility during the Games. They failed due to a lack of funds.\n\n\u201cThat would have been legacy,\u201d says Ms Ponulak. \u201cThat kind of link-up. But it didn\u2019t happen. The other issue we have is that in order to pay for our facilities here, we have to run them as a profit-generating sports centre, which inevitably restricts access.\u201d\n\nThat, according to Michael de Giorgio, of the Greenhouse charity which runs sporting programmes in dozens of London schools including Bacon\u2019s, is a central concern.\n\n\u201cThe facilities are there,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is access and, once you\u2019ve gained access, ensuring there is sufficient coaching to meet the demand. The whole point of legacy is it can only happen afterwards.\n\n\"There will be a huge surge of interest from young people around the Games, it\u2019s going to be great. We have to make sure that interest is nurtured and sustained by good, accessible coaching.\u201d\n\nThis has not always been the British way. Interest generated by the golden deeds of Daley Thompson, Torvill and Dean and Coe himself was not translated into a growth in participation.\n\nEven as recently as 2000, when Great Britain enjoyed a surge of unexpected gold medals in Sydney, several sports governing bodies were taken aback by the sudden gift of recruitment publicity. While some - rowing and cycling the exemplars - embraced the opportunity, in too many sports nothing was put in place to sustain the momentum.\n\nWith freedom of information legislation not extending to sports governing bodies, it is impossible to discover yet exactly what they have in mind to exploit London 2012. At Bacon\u2019s, everyone is confident the excitement will deliver an eager generation.

This is on top of the billions watching on television.\n\nThe Games, therefore, should be an advertisement for the businesses delivering the Games \u2013 such as the builder of the Olympic Stadium Sir Robert McAlpine - and an opportunity for all businesses to network with industrial and political leaders.\n\nHowever, some businesses are privately expressing concerns about the lack of firm plans from the Government to promote British business during the Olympics.\n\nIf it is not careful, British industry will be overshadowed by other nations who are already planning a takeover of London venues to advertise their commercial strengths.\n\nRussia will host a winter wonderland in Marble Arch, Brazil has booked Somerset House, and France has Old Billingsgate market in the City.\n\nVince Cable's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills says it is \"looking at holding a major exhibition\" to run alongside the Games that will promote the \"best of British manufacturing\".\n\nSources say the venue will be announced later this year, but no details have yet been publicly confirmed.\n\nA BIS spokesperson said the Government recognised the Olympics and Paralympics as a \"fantastic opportunity to showcase everything that's great about the UK\".\n\nThey added: \"We want to show that British businesses are winning \"gold medals\" for growth, jobs and prosperity. When the world comes to visit for the 2012 Games, we want to demonstrate Britain's excellence in advanced manufacturing through an expo that goes beyond demonstrating British manufacturing strengths but surprises and confounds expectations.\"\n\nSources say UK Trade & Investment will also be making a \"series of announcements\" in the next few months on how it will deliver a business legacy from the Olympics.\n\nIt has formed an \"Olympic Legacy Unit\" and created Host2Host, which aims to help companies who won work on London 2012 to secure contracts on future sporting events, such as the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. This has involved attending overseas conferences with the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and Olympic contractors to share how London 2012 has been constructed.\n\nThe official promotion agency for London, London & Partners, says it is planning to resurrect its \"London House\" initiative from the Beijing Olympics in 2008. This will see the creation of a physical hub which will host events celebrating London and its businesses.\n\nJanet Coyle, associate director, 2012 Games for London & Partners, says: \"The 'London House' for 2012 will actively showcase London's fantastic array of artistic, cultural and business assets and will highlight why London is considered as one of the world's most successful business capitals.\"\n\nLondon & Partners says it will confirm the venue and details of \"London House\" later this year, but is pressing ahead with other initiatives in the meantime.\n\n\"London & Partners is creating a full programme of events and activities for potential business investors during the 2012 Games,\" says Coyle.\n\n\"This builds on the 2012 campaigns already delivered in key international markets which has so far resulted in over 5,500 jobs created in London by inward investors. The range of events will include business showcases, seminars, receptions and round table debates where potential investors will be able to learn more about London's key strengths as well as network with London businesses.\"\n\nTraditional industry tradeshows in 2012 will also offer an opportunity to promote the UK and are being modified to make the most of the Olympics.\n\nIn aerospace, the Farnborough International Airshow, one of Britain's biggest tradeshows, has moved forward a week to July 9 in order to avoid clashing with the Games.\n\nOrganisers believe the show can benefit from an increase in overseas visitors to the UK and plan to take advantage of the country's focus on the Olympics by inviting former athletes to the show.\n\nHowever, as the private sector firms up its own plans, it would also like to see the ideas of the public sector quickly turn into reality.\n\nThis would not only help businesses to prepare for the Olympics, but provide reassurances that the promotion of Britain will not be overshadowed by the lavish marketing of other nations. As well as Russia, Brazil and France, America and other leading economies have plans in place for London 2012.\n\n\"It is a big opportunity that does not last that long \u2013 probably for this year and the year after the Games,\" John Armitt, chairman of the ODA, says. \"After that, the world moves on and people are looking at other things. You've got to maximise the sales pitch and the opportunity in that two year window.\"\n\nA recent survey of London businesses by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry found 69pc believe the Olympics can have a positive impact on the capital's reputation as an international business centre.\n\nHowever, it also warned that more must be done to ensure that companies are ready for the Games, while Armitt has cautioned that problems with Britain's infrastructure during the Olympics, especially transport, could overshadow the prompt construction of eye-catching sporting venues.\n\nBritain, therefore, has plenty of work to do before it can declare the Olympics a success.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01859/olystad5_1859676g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02785/ruddick-white_2785771a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03562/FDetox_Shopping_85_3562706g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03575/City_of_London_3575797g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01860/oly-stad_1860505g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01984/stad_1984098c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01871/olympics_1871968g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03554/dudley1_3554550g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01984/stad_1984098a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03568/Financial_Detox__h_3568618g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01861/getty-olympic_1861733g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01984/stad_1984098a.jpg", "date": "02/09/2011"}, "rank_69": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: OPLC is back to square one with a problem all of its own making", "text": "Ford started a new tender race to try to find the answer on Tuesday after the process that she began 18 months ago collapsed late on Monday amid legal uncertainty.\n\nWith just 10 months to go before the Games begin, the credibility of London\u2019s legacy rests on her finding a solution, but the precedent is not encouraging.\n\nThe new process marks the third time since 2005 that the Olympic stakeholders have tried to find a solution to a problem entirely of their own making. Both previous attempts have foundered for different specific reasons, but the failings stem from the same issue.\n\nFrom the outset the Olympic and political leaders who so brilliantly delivered the 2012 bid failed to accept that post-Games athletics cannot be at the heart of the stadium without someone else, either public subsidy or Premier League football, to pay for it. They have also under-estimated the opposition, be it Tottenham or Leyton Orient.\n\nLondon made a promise to the Olympic family that it would retain an athletics track, and it was a crucial factor in delivering the votes as International Association of Athletics Federations president Lamine Diack rallied his supporters behind Lord Coe\u2019s vision. London is after Diack\u2019s support again, in the bid for the 2017 World Championships, a factor in the timing of yesterday\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe Government is desperate to win the competition but, even if London is successful on Nov 11, the welcome benefits for track and field will come at someone else\u2019s expense.\n\nThe Olympic Delivery Authority was the first to wrestle with the problem in Sept 2006, after exploratory discussions with Tottenham and West Ham had ended without a deal when the clubs insisted that a permanent track was not viable.\n\nWith Coe, Tessa Jowell and Ken Livingstone all refusing to countenance a deal with a Premier League football club or taxpayer support, the ODA canvassed for a solution that would support the 25,000-seat stadium envisaged in the Olympic legacy.\n\nConsultants PMP Legacy spent 18 months attempting to construct a financial case for a mixed-use stadium combining rugby, athletics, concerts and lower-league football. Premier League clubs were expressly barred from the consultation.\n\nPMP\u2019s findings, delivered in early 2008, were inconclusive and damning. They warned that Premier League football was incompatible with a track, and that potential tenants had serious misgivings and that none had been willing to commit to the arena. They concluded that proceeding with the 25,000-seat option was high risk.\n\nThat message was finally acted on by Boris Johnson in late 2008, when he accepted that Premier League football was the only way to make the stadium viable. The London Mayor then hired Ford in April 2008 to move the goal-posts, and encouraged Spurs chairman Daniel Levy to bid.\n\nTo get Tottenham into the process, the OPLC had to fudge the issue of whether there had to be a track in the stadium. With Spurs genuinely believing it was negotiable, they proposed tearing down the Olympic Stadium and building a new football-only arena on the spot.\n\nWith their financial case stronger than West Ham\u2019s it was again the Olympic and athletic lobby that won the day, arguing that Britain had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to retain the running track.\n\nThe OPLC chose West Ham but the legal basis of their bid, reliant as it was on \u00a340 million of public funding from Newham Council, was challenged by Spurs and Leyton Orient and ultimately proved central to the collapse of their bid.\n\nThe Government said yesterday that \u201clegal paralysis\u201d was the reason for the change of tack but there was also the growing prospect of defeat.\n\nLeyton Orient were due to file new expert evidence in the High Court this week that went to the heart of the State Aid issue. A former vice-president of Bank of America was ready to testify that no investor would make a loan on similar terms to Newham.\n\nAn anonymous complaint to the European Commission further complicated matters. Both Tottenham and Orient deny that they are the source but it raised the prospect of further delays.\n\nAlongside the legal problems, the process was also damaged by the unintended consequence of the Government\u2019s guarantee to keep track until at least 2017, a commitment made to the IAAF last week.\n\nWith their single bidder no longer able to guarantee they could open the stadium on time in 2014, facing a strengthening legal challenge and the clock ticking on a High Court date next week, Ford and sports minister Hugh Robertson pulled the plug on the deal late on Monday.\n\nThey hope that by offering West Ham a cheaper deal, they can finally square the circle. But it felt more like they were back to square one.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01782/PaulKelso_60_1782322j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02024/olympic_stadium_2024296a.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02024/olympic_stadium_2024296b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02024/olympic_stadium_2024296a.jpg", "date": "11/10/2011"}, "rank_214": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: West Ham bid again as Olympic stadium deal collapses", "text": "\u2022 West Ham and Newham deal collapses after complaint to EU \u2022 West Ham and Leyton Orient confirm they will bid to be new tenants \u2022 Boris Johnson says public ownership to \"provide good return\" \u2022 Johnson also backs West ham to win tenancy \u2022 Sports minister: process had been \"bogged down in legal paralysis\" \u2022 Tottenham welcome OPLC decision \u2022 UK Athletics welcome the move as \"bold and decisive\"\n\nMayor of London Boris Johnson said that West Ham were still likely to take over the stadium, which will now remain in public ownership.\n\nJohnson said: \"We will keep it in public hands but we will effectively rent it to a football club, almost certainly West Ham, and that will cover the costs.\"\n\nThe fresh bids for tenancy will need to be made after the Olympic Park Legacy Company board decided last night to abandon negotiations with West Ham and Newham over the initial process.\n\nThey agreed to launch a new tender process because of fears that ongoing legal challenges could delay conversion of the stadium after next summer\u2019s Olympics.\n\nIt is understood that an anonymous complaint to the European Commission had raised the prospect of an indefinite delay to negotiations.\n\nJohnson denied that the venue would be a burden to public finances, even if initially funded by the the public.\n\n\"I am confident that this decision is the best way to ensure we have certainty over the stadium's future.\n\n\"I believe it will also put us in the place where we always intended to be - delivering a lasting sustainable legacy for the stadium backed up by a robust but flexible business plan that provides a very good return to the taxpayer.\"\n\nThe OPLC will now try to find a range of tenants willing to pay rent on the stadium, which will be reduced to 60,000 seats at a cost of \u00a350m drawn from OPLC funds.\n\nInterested parties will have until January to submit their bids and the OPLC will then try and put together a package of tenants that makes the stadium viable.\n\nThe move is still a major blow to London\u2019s legacy planning and continues the uncertainty over the flagship arena despite repeated promises over seven years that it would not be a white elephant.\n\nBut Sports minister Hugh Robertson moved to re-assure the public that it was the right decision.\n\n\"The key point is the action we have taken today is about removing the uncertainty,\" he said. \"The process had become bogged down in legal paralysis.\n\n\"Particularly relevant has been the anonymous complaint to the EC over 'state aid' and the OPLC received a letter from Newham Council yesterday saying because of the uncertainty they no longer wanted to proceed. That was the straw that broke the camel's back and we thought it better to stop it dead in it tracks now.\n\n\"We know there is huge interest in the stadium out there from private operators and football clubs and crucially we remove any uncertainty. This is not a white elephant stadium where no one wants it, we have had two big clubs fighting tooth and nail to get it.\"\n\nThe board\u2019s decision does remove uncertainty over London\u2019s 2017 World Athletics Championship bid, a major priority for government, but the cost to the taxpayer could be significant and there is no guarantee that the bid will defeat that of competitor Doha. Athletics has not provided any funding towards the stadium.\n\nFootball at the Olympic Stadium\n\nWest Ham confirmed they will again look to be a tenant, while Leyton Orient, who along with Tottenham Hotspur have been at the forefront of challenging the initial decision, said it was \"a fabulous day for Leyton Orient fans\".\n\nWest Ham deputy chairman Karren Brady said: \"Uncertainty caused by the anonymous complaint to the European Commission and ongoing legal challenges have put the Olympic legacy at risk and certainly a stadium, as we envisioned it, may not be in place by 2014 as a direct result of the legal delay.\n\n\"Therefore we would welcome a move by OPLC and Government to end that uncertainty and allow a football and athletic stadium to be in place by 2014 under a new process. If the speculation is true, West Ham will look to become a tenant of the stadium while Newham will aim to help deliver the legacy.\"\n\nBut Orient chairman Barry Hearn said: \"It puts the whole thing back in the public domain as it should be. The system of deliverance was fundamentally flawed and now they have got to go back to the beginning and start again and we will be an interested party in that bidding process.\n\n\"West Ham are not a shoo-in, that's very good because they will be competing with a host of other people who have claims on and plans for the Olympic Stadium. It's a legacy operation and at last the OPLC have finally listened to someone with common sense and said 'we messed it up before, let's not mess it up again'. The whole process starts now.\n\n\"I can tell you that I am definitely interested in being part of the tender process.\"\n\nTottenham, who were among the previous bidders for the Olympic Stadium, have also welcomed the decision. The club issued a statement saying: \"We welcome the OPLC decision to end the current Olympic Stadium bid process. We firmly believe that the bid we put forward was, in fact, a realistic sporting solution for the stadium, along with a substantial return to the taxpayer, community programming and athletics provision.\"\n\nLegal challenges to West Ham\u2019s deal with Newham had been brought by Tottenham and Orient, with a full judicial review of the case scheduled for next Tuesday.\n\nThe case has been complicated by the complaint to the European Commission, which could result in key elements of the case being staid indefinitely next week.\n\nBoth Spurs and Leyton Orient argued that the original West Ham deal, which would see Newham contribute \u00a340m as a loan to convert the stadium, constituted illegal state aid.\n\nWhile Tottenham were likely to abandon their challenge in favour of remaining in Haringey, Orient were committed to the legal proceedings and were due to file fresh evidence with the High Court this week.\n\nThey were highly confident of success and this may have been a factor in the board\u2019s decision to abandon the process last night.\n\nAthletics\n\nEd Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, welcomed the decision and said he now believed that athletics would remain central to the stadium's legacy.\n\n\"It's fantastic for UK Athletics and it is a bold and decisive move by the legacy company,\" said Warner.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02023/olympic-stadium_2023531a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01782/PaulKelso_60_1782322j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02023/olympics_2023528c.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02023/olympic-stadium_2023531c.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02023/olympic-stadium_2023531a.jpg", "date": "11/10/2011"}, "rank_81": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: UK's tallest sculpture completed on Olympic Park", "text": "The twisting red tower, situated next to the Olympic Stadium, was designed by Turner Prize-winning artist Anish Kapoor and structural designer Cecil Balmond and cost \u00a322.7 million to create.\n\nIt will have two observation floors, a 455-step spiral staircase a lift and even a restaurant, with the objective being that visitors go up to the top in a lift before walking down the spiral staircase to take in both the views and Kapoor's artistic detail.\n\nThose involved in the project hope that the tower, which is 22 metres taller than the Statue of Liberty, will remain a must-see attraction long after the Games have finished.\n\nSteel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, the chairman of ArcelorMittal, invested \u00a319.6 million, while the remaining \u00a33.1 million is coming from the Greater London Authority.\n\n\u201cWe conceived this project in partnership to ensure the Olympic legacy will stretch well beyond the Games itself, helping to ensure the ongoing regeneration of this part of London,\u201d said Mittal.\n\nMayor of London Boris Johnson gave the sculpture his full backing, and hailed the Orbit as an \"iconic\" addition to the skyline of the capital.\n\n\"What better calling card for London 2012 than a piece of truly spectacular modern British art to drive visitors to east London in perpetuity,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"It would have boggled the minds of the Romans.

We have a problem with Dow Chemical at the moment with the Olympic Stadium,\" he said.\n\n\"There are a few names of sponsors at the political end, for ethical reasons, you would probably want to avoid, and you have every right to.\n\n\"You couldn't know [that Dow Chemicals would be a problem]. It is one of the things that people have blown up, in my view, out of all proportion.\n\n\"[But] it might be a bit of an own goal to invite Dow Chemicals in now, for example.\"\n\nDow, who has funded the \u00a37 million wrap of the Olympic Stadium, has come under fire recently due to its links with Union Carbide Corporation, whose subsidiary, Union Carbide India, ran the Bhopal pesticide plant.\n\nIn December 1984, a gas leak at Bhopal proved one of the worst industrial disasters in history, officially killing 3,787 people though campaigners suggest the correct figure is nearer 25,000.\n\nThe resulting furore has led to calls in India for a boycott of the Games, and demands that the International Olympic Committee drops the company as a sponsor.\n\nTo complicate matters, the IOC receive \u00a360 million a year from Dow, who have dismissed the protests against them.\n\nDow have stated that Union Carbide's \u00a3288 million ($470 million) settlement for those affected by the leak - which was paid in 1989 (10 years before Dow's merge) - is fair and final.\n\nThe IOC and British politicians have gone on record to say that Dow, the second largest chemical manufacturer in the world, will not be relinquished as sponsors of the London Games, for whom it will provide a fabric wrap for the stadium which will be 900m (0.56 miles) long and 20m (67ft) high.\n\nCurrie said that the \"morality clause\" should be in place for any sponsor of the Olympic Stadium so that in future, should a similar situation arise, damaged reputations will be financially rewarded.\n\nCurrie continue: \"All you can do is put clauses in the contract to that effect - if anything happens subsequently which threatens to damage the reputation of you, or anybody else.\n\n\"Most sponsorships now have something called a 'morality clause'. It is less pertinent for a venue, it is more pertinent for a team or a sport where someone takes drugs, or what happened with Tiger Woods and the problems he had.\"\n\nHowever, Currie said that the stadium and general Olympic legacy has an opportunity to be better than any other Games since 1984, when Los Angeles hosted them.\n\nHe added: \"It is a fantastic opportunity - the revenue opportunities in venue sponsorship are hugely undervalued in this country. We have been way, way behind the game in terms of developing naming rights for venues.\n\n\"I think the last two Olympics are not great examples [in how to maximise naming rights and legacy] - Beijing have rules that don't apply in certain other territories and Athens was a very small territory.\n\n\"London is a real hub. We have more major sport in this country than anyone else. We are a major player in the sporting world. I think it is a much bigger opportunity than any of the last few Games, probably going back to Los Angeles.\n\n\"There is not a science to it [securing decent sponsorship] - I don't think we need to do too much wheeling and dealing, thanks to the hype of the Olympics.\n\n\"You have a great advantage and political power at a very high level. Other people selling sponsorships do not have that advantage. You have to contact the right people at the right level.\n\n\"It is going to be a big decision for companies - it is multi millions of pounds over a long period of time. It is potentially a huge commitment for brands to make. It will be made at a very high level.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Robbie Millar, a senior partner of Effective Brands, recommended that Olympic Park be marketed under a single umbrella. \"I agree with that and would actively encourage [the committee] to do that,\" he said.\n\n\"The Olympic Stadium will deliver huge revenues.

Late last year however that estimate increased to 23,700, doubling the cost to \u00a3553m.\n\nThe Home Office described Locog\u2019s original estimate as a \u201cfinger-in-the-air exercise\u201d, but the PAC reject their argument that costs could not have been more accurately worked out earlier.\n\n\u201cWe do not accept Locog\u2019s and the Home Office\u2019s assertion that the likely cost and numbers could not have been better estimated much earlier,\u201d the report states.\n\nLocog is criticised for agreeing the new terms of its contract with private security provider G4S. While the number of guards covered by the new contract has increased six-fold, G4S\u2019s programme-management costs have increased nine-fold, and operational costs 20-fold.\n\nThe report states that Locog re-negotiated the contract too late, and should have demanded a reduction in G4S\u2019s profit margin.\n\nThe PAC is also critical of government sports legacy plans, declaring that the \u00a3450m spent on increasing sports participation represents poor value for money, with just 106,000 more people taking up sport.\n\nThe report also warns that the Olympic Stadium must not become a \u201cwhite elephant\u201d.\n\nPAC chairman Margaret Hodge said that while venue construction costs were on time and on budget, she was concerned about the eventual cost of the Games.\n\n\"The \u00a39.3 billion Public Sector Funding Package is close to being used up and we are concerned about whether the running of the Games will be held within budget,\" she said:\n\n\"Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around \u00a311 billion.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the significant increases in the security bill. LOCOG now needs more than twice the number of security guards it originally estimated and the costs have roughly doubled.\n\n\"It is staggering that the original estimates were so wrong. LOCOG has had to renegotiate its contract with G4S for venue security from a weak negotiating position and there is a big question mark over whether it secured a good deal for the taxpayer.\n\n\u201cWe were promised a strong Olympic legacy but the Government has chosen not to adopt the target of one million more people participating in sport by 2013, and plans for the stadium have fallen through.

Since then people could not help wondering how the UK would once again wow the world.\n\nFour years ago there was doubt and uncertainty about how the Beijing Olympic Games would turn out. The world gave Beijing a chance. In turn Beijing rewarded the world with a pleasant surprise.\n\nFour years on, the Beijing Olympic Games has gone beyond being just a grand sports gathering, where both Chinese and British athletes scored high. It has left a profound legacy for China as a country.\n\nOf course, part of the Olympic legacy is visible assets. They are the spectacular sports stadiums like the \u201cBird\u2019s Nest\u201d and the \u201cWater Cube\u201d. These stadiums are in constant use.\n\nThe visible legacy must also include the state-of-the-art transport infrastructure such as the T3 terminal of the Beijing Capital International Airport, the expanded underground rail network and the express road networks. These facilities have become indispensable in the everyday life of our capital and improved public facilities in culture, tourism and the environment.\n\nPreviously, Asia had hosted two Olympic Games, Tokyo in 1964 and Seoul in 1988. These two games had greatly advanced the modernisation process in Japan and the ROK. Likewise, the Beijing Olympic Games has also become a milestone in China\u2019s progress.\n\nIn hosting the Olympic Games, Beijing achieved massive gains in its modernisation. Yet more importantly, the Beijing Olympic Games has left a wealth of cultural legacy for the whole of China. It has transformed China in several aspects.\n\nChina has become more confident. The Beijing Olympic Games was China\u2019s long held dream coming true. It was also a symbol of China\u2019s maturity after many years of growth.\n\nThe 2008 Games placed China on the global stage. This focus in the global spotlight helped China cope with much greater attention from around the world in a calm and confident way as befits a major country, no matter whether it is being complimented or criticised.\n\nChina has become more open. The Beijing Olympic Games was China\u2019s debut on the world stage. It helped China send out a strong message of engaging with the world. It strengthened China\u2019s conviction in openness.\n\nThrough the Beijing Olympic Games, China is now even more committed to peaceful development and fully aware of a big country\u2019s responsibilities. At the same time China has become more inter-connected with the world. The Beijing Olympic Games offered a great opportunity for Chinese ideas to interact with those from other parts of the world.\n\nThe three guiding principles of the Games \u2013 green Olympics, high-tech Olympics and people\u2019s Olympics \u2013 made the Chinese people far more conscious about environmental protection, scientific innovation and all-round development of themselves.\n\nAs a result, sustainable development and a clean environment is our basic goal now. The government is putting more stress on scientific innovation and shift of growth model. Civil participation and voluntarism is nothing new in today\u2019s China.\n\nMy British friends often tell me that Beijing has set the bar too high for London. The 2008 Beijing Olympics would be a tough act for London to follow. My reply is there is no uniform criteria for the success of an Olympic Games. As long as the host presents interesting and creative ideas and athletes bring out their best in competitions, then the Games will be successful.\n\nI believe these are exactly the strengths of the UK. Britain has a reservoir of wisdom and resources. It leads the world in ideas and creativity. This is why China has laid so much emphasis on cultural exchanges with the UK.\n\nFor the very purpose of boosting China-UK cultural and people-to-people exchanges, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Mr Li Changchun and Chinese State Councillor Madame Liu Yandong are visiting the UK.\n\nThey will attend the China Market Focus event at the London Book Fair and Madame Liu will launch the high-level people-to-people dialogue with her UK colleagues. Their visits will certainly lend a new impetus to strong and sustained growth of China-UK relations.\n\nI strongly believe that, like China in 2008, the 2012 London Olympics will be a great success and leave a lasting legacy for the British people.", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02194/birdsnest_2194069a.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02194/birdsnest_2194069b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02194/birdsnest_2194069a.jpg", "date": "16/04/2012"}, "rank_54": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics will inspire future generations says Lord Coe as official slogan is unveiled", "text": "Lord Coe, the organising committee chairman, unveiled the slogan as London marked 100 days until the opening ceremony at a damp Kew Gardens, one place where the untimely rain that fell on a series of stage-managed media events was at least welcome.\n\nThere was no dampening Coe\u2019s enthusiasm for the theme that was at the heart of London\u2019s successful bid, however, and he summoned a resonant phrase to insist London\u2019s legacy will be more durable despite the doubts and criticism.\n\n\u201cI hope there is no surprise in the motto,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the heartbeat, the very DNA of this organisation. It is also a rallying cry to the athletes to come to the UK and perform at their very best.\n\n\"The achievements of every one of those Olympians and Paralympians will create a symphony of inspiration.\n\n\u201cEvery day I tell my teams that for the athletes the Games have been the focus of half of their young lives, and we cannot let them become a victim of our shortcomings.\u201d\n\nLandmarks such as the beginning of the 100-day countdown are an opportunity for Olympic organising committees, and London used theirs to try and excite international interest, celebrate progress, and focus attention on a party yet to fully ignite domestic enthusiasm.\n\nLondon\u2019s did so with a neat municipal touch, They unveiled flower beds in the shape of the Olympic rings at Kew, visible from the Heathrow flight-path, and pictures of a huge sandcastle on Weymouth beach that was washed away within hours of being photographed. They now have to prove that the Olympic legacy is more durable.\n\nPerennial concerns around security, transport, ticketing, and even the drought were all raised by a significant international media presence yesterday \u2014 a Norwegian journalist asked if London had enough water, to which the answer appeared to be only just \u2014 but repeatedly the attention returned to the question of what the Games will leave behind.\n\nLondon\u2019s progress has been unusually serene for a modern Olympics. The organising committee, Olympic Delivery Authority and other agencies have ticked off milestones with comparatively little drama, notwithstanding the gradual depletion of contingency in a \u00a39.3bn public-funding package that, in the government\u2019s alternative motto, remains on time and under-budget.\n\nAs they have done so, however, attention on the legacy of the Games has grown, the focus sharpening as the prevailing economic climate has darkened and a tangible public return on taxpayer investment has become more imperative.\n\nThe case for the inspirational power of the Olympics is far from proven, and Coe set a high bar when he made promises on London\u2019s behalf seven years ago.\n\nNo Games has ever delivered a major boost in sports participation, and London has followed the trend, with a target of one million more people taking part in regular sport abandoned after four years that saw \u00a3450m deliver just 10% of that number.\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s commitment to youth participation was undermined almost immediately it came to power, with \u00a3165m of ring-fenced school-sports funding cut in an ideological change to education policy that a subsequent U-turn only partially reversed.\n\nFormer Olympics minister Tessa Jowell, an Olympic loyalist since leaving office, criticised the government\u2019s progress on this key issue yesterday, but Culture secretary Jeremy Hunt and sports minister Hugh Robertson insist that London is already delivering.\n\nHunt claimed that the Olympics represented a huge opportunity for business and tourism, and defended sport\u2019s funding. \u201cWe are operating in very difficult economic circumstances and we have a different policy to the last government, but we remain committed to delivering a legacy.\u201d\n\nRobertson was emphatic in his belief that British sport is better off, with more facilities, more funding and more opportunities than ever before.\n\n\u201cCentral to the bid was the promise to regenerate east London and regenerate Olympic sport,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what this has delivered you see new facilities, an increase in lottery funding that will put an extra \u00a3500m into sports, better-funded elite athletes, education programmes and millions of children in 20 different countries touched by out International Inspiration project.\n\n\"Taken together it\u2019s an incredibly powerful package.\u201d Coe is in no doubt. \u201cI spend a lot of time in London, and globally, and I see a lot of things that just would not have happened if we had come back from Singapore empty-handed.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01782/PaulKelso_60_1782322j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02197/olympics_2197257a.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02196/coe_2196885b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02197/olympics_2197257a.jpg", "date": "18/04/2012"}, "rank_149": {"title": "London mayoral election 2012: how Boris and Ken's records compare", "text": "When Ken Livingstone was confirmed in September 2010 as Labour candidate for Mayor of London , the stage was set for a clash of the Titans.\n\nTwo of the best known politicians in the country will slug it out today in a fight that is too close to call.\n\nCurrently the Conservatives' Boris Johnson leads in the polls, with 52 per cent of the vote versus 48 per cent, after second preferences are taken into account.\n\nBut even a small swing could be enough to tip the balance towards Livingstone.\n\nLivingstone served as mayor for eight years until 2008, when he was toppled by the incumbent Johnson.\n\nThat is the background to one of the most bitterly fought elections of recent years, with each side liberally pelting the other with insults.\n\nHere we compare their track record in four key areas, judged by Londoners [PDF] to be the issues they care about the most.\n\nCrime rate\n\nTotal crime in London has decreased year-on-year since 2002/03, if you do not take into account last summer's riots (although there is controversy over how the rate is counted). Yet both candidates accuse each other in their manifestos of not combating crime appropriately.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s manifesto cites: \u201cComparing my term against that of my predecessor: There are 1,000 extra warranted officers on the London\u2019s streets now than there were in May 2008. Total crime has been cut by 10.8 per cent\u201d.\n\nThe annual figures do not quite bear this out. In 2007/08, the year before Johnson came to power, there were 113.5 crimes for every 1000 people. This dropped to 105.3 in 2010/11, the last year for which data is available - a fall of 7.2 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, Livingstone argues that although crime has fallen, the rate of decline has slowed to only one per cent. He adds in his manifesto: \"Overall crime was cut significantly when I was Mayor and continues to fall. [But...] robberies have increased... It is scandalous that in the face of this crime wave the Tory Mayor cut the number of police.\"\n\nIn fact, robbery rates peaked in 2006/07, during Livingstone's second term, at 6.1 robberies per 1000. They fell to 4.3 in 2009/10, before a slight rise to 4.6 last year.\n\nLivingstone's claims of a 'crime wave' could be seen as overblown, when the latest figure is 25 per cent lower than it was four years ago.\n\nTravel costs\n\nBus and tube fares increased substantially during Johnson's term, including a whopping 14.1 per cent rise in bus prices in 2010.\n\nThis year, a week-long travelcard for zones one and two will set you back \u00a329.20 - up from \u00a324.20 when Johnson became mayor in 2008.\n\nJohnson notes in his manifesto that delays on the underground system have been cut by 40%, but admits that more upgrades still need to be done.\n\nHe hangs back from promising price cuts, but says: \u201cI promise to be honest and transparent about fares setting and by cutting waste at TFL, my approach will keep fares low in the long term\u201d.\n\nLivingstone shows no such hesitance. He writes: \u201cI will cut fares by 7% this year and freeze them throughout 2013.\u201d\n\nCutting travel costs is a real crowd pleaser in London, where many live more than an hour away from work.\n\nLivingstone also cut fares in 2008, shortly before his pre-election campaign: bus fares fell by 6.6%, while tube fares were cut by 1.2 per cent.\n\nBut previously costs had risen across the board - notably in 2005 and 2006, when bus fares jumped by 9.7 per cent then 10 per cent.\n\nUnemployment\n\nLondon unemployment rate floated one to two per cent above the national average for more than a decade, and has echoed the nationwide rise since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nBoris Johnson promises in his manifesto to combat this by creating 200,000 jobs in London in the next four years, including 10,000 roles through the Olympic legacy and 14,000 in the Crossrail scheme.\n\nLivingstone takes the alternative view that the London mayor's powers are insufficient to \"boost growth in London's economy\".\n\nHowever, he claims that with his policies Londoners will have more money in their pocket and will be better equipped to survive the economic crisis.\n\nHe pledges to champion equal pay for women, to extend London apprenticeships for 16- to 18-year-olds and oppose restrictive practices on hiring skilled workers from abroad.\n\nHousing\n\nHouse prices have been on the rise throughout both of the candidates' past terms.\n\nIndeed, London property sales have stayed strong while prices across the rest of the country have tumbled.\n\nAlthough this has provided relief for home-owners, who have seen their assets grow in value, first-time buyers are struggling to get onto the property ladder.\n\nDeposit requirements have risen beyond the reach of many young workers.\n\nLivingstone pledges: \u201cI will investigate providing mortgage deposit guarantee for people who are able to service a mortgage but not able to access the large deposit to get on the housing ladder\u201d.\n\nHe also promises to build 35,000 new homes a year.\n\nSimilarly, Johnson pledges 55,000 new affordable homes by 2015 for low and middle income workers,\n\nHe adds: \u201cI will boost the First-Steps programme of low-cost home ownership products as their circumstances change, and encouraging providers to develop products which let households convert rent into equity\u201d.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02552/deacon-heads_2552589g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/grandad_3602577g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02190/cal-flyn_2190366a.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02209/polling_boris_2209969g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02207/brosi-ken-aliens_2207757k.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02209/potd-polling-camer_2209800g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02208/David_Cameron3_2208983g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/Wombat-1-e_3602888g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03188/Homepage_Politics__3188625e.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03549/scientist-in-lab_3549159g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02552/kirkup-heads_2552586g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02207/brosi-ken-aliens_2207757k.jpg", "date": "03/05/2012"}, "rank_194": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: torch lighting one of many similarities between ancient and modern Games", "text": "The relay ritual itself is a relatively recent Olympic confection, but the symbolism of its journey from the movement\u2019s spiritual home to the London stadium is an attempt to tie the ancient Games to the modern.\n\nBut it is far from the only link between the original Games, which began in Olympia in 778BC, and the modern incarnation. As Tony Perrottet\u2019s The Naked Olympics describes, a visitor from pre-Christian Olympia would recognise London 2012 as a descendant of the ancient Games \u2013 and not always for the most welcome reasons.\n\nJust as the members of the International Olympic Committee control the modern Games, a small elite based in the city of Elis, a provincial farming town 40 miles from Olympia, were the guardians of the ancient Games. A wealthy clan of aristocratic Elians, who owed their income to cattle and stud farms, controlled the Games and the athletes. The Elians formed an Olympic Council which ran the Games: they set the rules and appointed the 10 all-powerful Olympic judges, the Hellanodikai, who were part organising committee, part judging panel. Like the IOC the Hellanodikai were selected by a mix of voting and appointment, and once in post were granted privileges and huge status.\n\nThe original stadium represents the ultimate Olympic legacy, still visited by tourists 2,800 years on, but it was not always so. Between Games the arena fell in to disrepair. While the temples of Olympia were staffed year-round, the stadium needed full renovation in between Games.\n\nBrutal qualifying\n\nAs in the modern games, the athletes arrived in Elis a month before competition got under way for their final selection and preparations. All potential competitors were required to report to the city 30 days before the Games and subject themselves to training and selection by the Elians.\n\nThe strict regime, in which slackers were flogged or dismissed, was used to winnow out the weakest athletes.\n\nUnhappy punters\n\nAround 40,000 people would flock to Olympia to watch the five days of competition, with the class divide between wealthy and ordinary punters as marked as at a modern Games. The rich would arrive with caravans of servants to nab the best camping spots, while ordinary fans who had trekked on foot to get there had to sleep in the dust in the heat of a Greek August. Conditions were appalling, with no sanitation and limited water as nearby rivers dried up. Thankfully there was a thriving army of licensed vendors ready to sell them food and wine.\n\n'Plastic Greeks'\n\nTo win a place in the Games competitors had to prove that they were the legitimate son of a free-born Greek. While women, slaves and the illegitimate were banned, the definition of what constituted 'Greek\u2019 could be more flexible. The boundaries of the Greek empire meant that some had a tougher job proving their heritage, and following the Roman conquest in 146BC the rules were relaxed to allow anyone who spoke Greek to compete. It was common for athletes to change their citizenship between Games, switching their city state for cash. Others were less welcome. A Spartan who claimed he was Boeotian to avoid a ban was flogged.\n\nExposing the cheats\n\nThe ancient games were held in homage to the gods but that did not prevent the athletes succumbing to earthly vices. Those found to have rigged results, usually by paying off the opposition, were shamed by the ancient equivalent of the BOA by-law, having their names inscribed on stones lining the athletes\u2019 tunnel. BOA chairman Lord Moynihan pointed them out at the torch lighting in Olympia last week, but did not comment on whether he had brought his chisel to add a name or two of his own.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01782/PaulKelso_60_1782322j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02221/OLYMPIAAFP_2221439a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02272/oxford_2272460g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02327/summary_2327839g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02221/OLYMPIAAFP_2221439b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02253/torch_2253983g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02221/OLYMPIAAFP_2221439a.jpg", "date": "19/05/2012"}, "rank_159": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: Sport England claim participation surge despite missing targets", "text": "Increasing sports participation was a central tenet of London\u2019s Olympic promise, but the final figures before the Games from Sport England offer mixed evidence that it has been delivered.\n\nThe numbers show that 1.3m more people are playing sport at least once a week since London won the Games in 2005, with the number exceeding 15 million people for the first time.\n\nJust six out of 31 funded sports have shown a statistically significant increase in participation in the last four years, with 15 showing a decrease and 10 flat-lining.\n\nAthletics (running), cycling, netball, boxing, table tennis and fencing are the sports that showed a significant increase, though of these only running (370,000) and cycling (170,000) delivered six-figure increases over the last four years.\n\nSwimming has shown the largest numerical decrease over the last four years with around 430,000 fewer participants. For a core Olympic sport to suffer such a decrease demonstrates that the Games are not a guarantor of increasing interest.\n\nWorryingly participation fell among 16-24 year-olds, precisely the age-group the Olympics was intended to inspire. New government policy is aimed at arresting the decline.\n\nThe figures also confirm that the number of people doing sport three-times-a-week, which for most of the last four years was the government\u2019s primary Olympic legacy target, had increased by just 500,000 since 2008, just half of the one million target.\n\nHad the Coalition not abandoned the target earlier this year when it became clear it was going to be missed by a wide margin, Sport England\u2019s investment of \u00a3450m over four years might be judged a failure.\n\nThe picture after the Olympics is likely to become bleaker, with Sport England chief executive Jennie Price admitting that she is planning for cuts to funding after the Olympics.\n\n\u201cWe realise like everybody else that this is a very difficult economic climate and we would be foolish to plan for any increases [in funding],\u201d she said.\n\nNo previous Olympics has delivered a participation increase and these figures demonstrate just how hard it is. Despite the increase in once-a-week participation, some of which can be put down to a milder winter, the figures reveal marginal increases, even with the hype and focus provided by London 2012.\n\nPrice defended her organisation\u2019s performance said the Olympics had delivered an increase for those sports that prepared for it.\n\n\u201cOur overall numbers are strong, and our numbers are up both in terms of actual participants and the trend so we are pleased,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is evidence of growth in these numbers, but we would just like to see more of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Olympics were always an opportunity, never a guarantee. If you look at sports that have really thought about how they can capitalise on interest in the Olympics, such as hockey, then you can see an increase. There is evidence of an Olympic effect but only for sports that worked hard to secure it.\u201d\n\nAsked about the three-times-a-week target she said: \u201cYou would expect me to say this but the current government has decided to abandon that target.\n\n\u201cWe have got 500,000 more people doing sport three-times a week, and there has been a 350,000 increase in the last six months so there is an upward trend. The date for judging the target is also 2013, not this year. But there is evidence of real growth in tough circumstances.\u201d\n\nSport England will reveal how much money it intends to distribute to governing bodies in its next four-year cycle, from 2013-2017, in December. It will be increasingly reliant on Lottery funding in future, with 75 per cent of its income coming from that source.\n\nIt is also expected to merge with high-performance agency UK Sport after the Olympics, a process already fraught with internal politics and friction.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01782/PaulKelso_60_1782322j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02256/graph5000_2256193b.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02256/SUNDAYLEAGUEGETTY_2256017b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02256/graph3_2256175c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/athletes-summary_2334882g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/parade-fans_2334695g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02256/graph4_2256178c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02327/summary_2327839g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02256/SUNDAYLEAGUEGETTY_2256017a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02256/graph200_2256166c.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02256/SUNDAYLEAGUEGETTY_2256017a.jpg", "date": "22/06/2012"}, "rank_38": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: Seb Coe honoured with award in recognition of Olympic legacy", "text": "The award, launched by global organisation Beyond Sport in partnership with P&G and The Telegraph to recognise the UK's most innovative and successful sport for change projects, was presented by Coe at the Beyond Sport London Reception, held just one month before the Beyond Sport Summit & Awards are staged in London in the week of the Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nAcross the UK, Street League uses football to reach young people who are NEET (Not Employed, in Education or Training) and strives to improve their lives.\n\nThe programme has impacted over 20,000 hard-to-reach young people, many of whom have offending and/or substance-misuse backgrounds.\n\nBy combining soft-skills training with accredited courses \u2013 including CV writing, interview training and FA Level 1 coaching \u2013 Street League has been able to provide participants with routes to employment, training or schooling.\n\nChief executive Matt Stevenson-Dodd said: \u201cWe are very proud of our track record, which sees three out of four graduates from the Street League academy get a job or return to education.

Singapore in 2005, when the two-time Olympic gold medallist vowed that the London 2012 Games would \"reach young people all around the world and connect them to the inspirational power of the Games so they are inspired to choose sport, improving their lives as a result.\"\n\n\u201cInternational Inspiration\u2019s work has been a key part of London 2012\u2019s vision to inspire young people around the world, and I am delighted to accept this Award from Beyond Sport on behalf of everyone who has contributed to its success,\u201d said Coe.\n\n\u201cTo have made a difference in the lives of over 12 million children around the world before London 2012 even gets underway is testament to the incredible power of sport.\u201d\n\nNathan Homer, Sports Marketing & Olympics Project Director at Procter

certainly don\u2019t care to see it\u201d. To this assessment she added that \u201cpossibly all the failures of this generation, the world over, have been suddenly swept into London, for the streets are a restless, breathing, malodorous pageant of the seedy of all nations\u201d.\n\nAll these years later, I am rather inclined to agree with Ms Cather, who would have slipped into a catatonic depression today had she got off her plane from New York and queued for several hours at border control. Sadly, our capital can often seem like a stinking hellhole, and if Samuel Johnson had had to spend every morning waving eight Tubes past until one arrived that he could squeeze in to by folding himself in half, he would have tired of London \u2013 and life \u2013 pretty damn quickly.\n\nMy first experience of the city came in the summer of 1980, when I was born in a hospital west of Hammersmith. I have spent the years since living here \u2013 and desperately trying not to. As a girl whose school was situated on the most polluted road in Europe, I would beg my parents to send me to some bucolic boarding school \u2013 but they told me that because we lived in London, they couldn\u2019t afford to.\n\nNot being able to afford things is the main experience of people who live in London; we can\u2019t afford to live here, but we can\u2019t afford not to, what with the rocketing costs of rail travel in from the ''burbs\u2019\u2019, coupled with the fact that all the jobs are here. We\u2019d talk about it, get through the experience through shared counselling, but of course we don\u2019t talk to one another, except to be rude. To wit: I was once mugged (not to be confused with the three times I have been burgled) in broad daylight, on a main road, in front of a bus stop crowded with people who did nothing because they were too busy silently seething at the fact they had already waited 25 minutes for the 44.\n\nWhen ''we\u2019\u2019 \u2013 as if anyone in London is in anything together \u2013 ''won\u2019\u2019 the Olympics in 2005, my reaction was not of joy but incredulity.

Are you quite sure about that?\u201d I thought London\u2019s Olympic dream would be rather like trying to put lipstick on a pig.\n\nThe Games did at least give Londoners something to moan about. \u201cThe traffic\u2019s going to be awful,\u201d taxi drivers would say, while stuck in traffic. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be loads of tourists,\u201d people would spit, as they elbowed their way past... well, loads of tourists.\n\nBut look. Something has changed almost overnight in London. Big pink neon signs have gone up all over the transport system offering directions to Olympic venues \u2013 Horse Guards Parade several miles this way, the Olympic Village several miles that way \u2013 and they make me smile.\n\nLondoners are even being nice to tourists, trying to show them the best of the city. And taxi drivers have stopped whingeing.\n\nPeople I have met who had refused to get involved with the rigmarole of ticket applications now wish they had entered the ballot; my friend Olivia is beaming at the prospect of the freestyle wrestling tickets she obtained for 8.15am on a Sunday.\n\nYou can say what you like about London (and I believe I just have), but when it comes down to it, we know how to put on a show. Look how beautifully we behaved during the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, and the royal wedding. As a city, we are tremendously good at playing host to other people, not so good at conversing with one another. Perhaps the real Olympic legacy that Locog endlessly talks about could be extending to ourselves the courtesies we so readily offer to other nations.\n\nDaddy\u2019s girl Nell does him proud\n\nNell Diamond, not to be confused with the singer Neil Diamond (no relation), is the daughter of Bob Diamond \u2013 or, as she tweeted the other day, rather drolly, \u201cBob Diamante\u201d (goodness knows what fate awaits his former Barclays colleague Rich Ricci). She also tweeted that Ed Miliband and George Osborne could \u201cHMD\u201d, a yoof phrase newspapers have attempted to spell out without being able to actually spell it out, given its fruity nature.\n\nAnyway, all of this has landed Nell \u2013 a Princeton graduate who works at Deutsche Bank \u2013 on the front pages, which makes a change from seeing her father\u2019s increasingly worn-down mug there. Poor Nell has been rounded on in much the same way as Dad, but I think her behaviour is rather touching. In this day and age it would be all too easy to distance yourself from an embarrassing parent \u2013 change your name to Nell Cubic Zirconia, for example \u2013 but instead she has stood up for him and deflected criticism by acting like an embarrassing daughter. Here, for example, is a Tweet outlining young Nell\u2019s work ethic, one that would make all bankers proud: \u201cTabs on my Internet Explorer: Puffin Livecam, Pugs Dressed as Darth Vader, Hedgehogs Cuddling, Federal Reserve Outright Treasury Holdings.\u201d\n\nSo thank God for Nell. Without her, we wouldn\u2019t have the picture of her father throwing shapes at a Jay-Z concert, or the snap of him dressed like Inspector Gadget, clutching the FA Cup as he stands next to John Terry (two of the most loathsome men in Britain in one family photo \u2013 wonderful!).\n\nThe member of the Diamond clan I am most keen to know more about, though, is Nell\u2019s brother Rob (as his father is Robert Diamond Jr, does this make him Rob Jr Jr? Please do keep up at the back). A close friend who met young Rob tells me that he is fascinated with British government, and that he planned to do his dissertation on William Hague\u2019s failed election campaign. On many levels, he probably won\u2019t be so enamoured with our political system now.\n\nWe should be nice to them \u2013 they didn\u2019t ask to be born into a world of privilege or wealth. Also, it\u2019s worth noting that both our Prime Minister and his deputy are the offspring of bankers. Who knows, the next stop for Nell might just be the White House.\n\nThat\u2019s enough flashing of the athletic flesh\n\nWhile I am excited about the Olympics, there are certain elements I am a little sick of: namely, the athletes\u2019 bodies, which I feel I know more about than the athletes themselves. If it isn\u2019t Victoria Pendleton showing us a shapely bottom in an arty black and white photo, then it is Jessica Ennis (below) posing in a skintight frock for Cosmopolitan magazine, telling us that she is \u201ccomfortable being naked\u201d and that she rates her body confidence as seven out of 10.\n\nOf course, Ennis was hitting back at the senior UK Athletics official who said she was \u201ccarrying too much weight\u201d. But I can\u2019t help thinking there are more important things to be discussing at this juncture. Plus, if her body confidence is only seven out of 10, what hope for the rest of us? Anyway, it is unthinkable to imagine Chris Hoy telling, say, GQ how he rates his self-esteem out of 10 \u2013 then again, men aren\u2019t subject to the same ridiculous standards as women, who must be both athletes and \u201cnormal\u201d girls the rest of us can relate to. But I don\u2019t relate to Ennis any more than I do Cindy Crawford or Queen Noor of Jordan; the point of her is that she is absolutely, wonderfully, nothing like the rest of us.\n\nSoon after the \u201cfat\u201d jibe, she set a new heptathlon record. When it comes to silencing her critics, there\u2019s a better way than posing for a magazine: winning an Olympic medal.\n\nFifty shades at least \u2013 and we\u2019ve read them all\n\nLoath as I am to give any more publicity to the Fifty Shades phenomenon, I want to ask: since when was sex in literature anything new? Mills and Boon have been accused of jumping on the bandwagon with their new series of racy e-novels, but they\u2019ve always been a bit naughty; it is a little patronising to women to suggest that we have all had sexual awakenings thanks to E L James. Bad sex is so absolutely British that there is even a literary award for it, won in the past by figures as prestigious as Haruki Murakami and David Guterson, the author of Snow Falling on Cedars. One must beg the judging panel not to insult their writing by giving the prize to James this year.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02327/summary_2327839g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02267/olympic_2267872b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01839/Bryony-Gordon2_60_1839365j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02267/olympic_2267872a.gif"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02267/olympic_2267872a.gif", "date": "04/07/2012"}, "rank_151": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: The Games can be a beacon of aspiration amid the gloom", "text": "This is a summer of giddy mood swings, of bipolar Britain. The economic skies are as gloomy as the weather, the disgrace of the banks deepens, the media is still on trial at the Leveson Inquiry, and the Prime Minister tells The Daily Telegraph that \u201cI can\u2019t see any time soon when the pressure will be off.\u201d\n\nYet this otherwise solid wall of grey has been broken up by moments of glorious colour and celebration. First, the Diamond Jubilee was triumphant evidence that one national institution at least is in robust good health, and that the monarchy, now thoroughly at ease in its modern setting, is still capable of encapsulating and inspiring the spirit of British optimism. When the Queen walked on stage at the end of the celebratory concert outside Buckingham Palace last month, to acknowledge graciously the Prince of Wales\u2019s perfectly judged tribute and the applause of 1.5 million Britons gathered in London, it was hard to believe that this is a country in the grip not only of austerity-without-end but of an intermittent panic attack about its trajectory, compounded by collective fury at the political and financial elites which got us in this mess in the first place.\n\nOn Friday, this mood of misery and apprehension will be suspended once more as the opening ceremony of the London Olympics is beamed around the world. The needle on the national dashboard will again swing from one extreme to the other. There will be glitches, complaints, and strongly worded letters to the press about the way in which the broadcasters are covering outdoor Jenga. Any travel delays will be treated as the infrastructural equivalent of an outbreak of Ebola (not to be confused with Jenga). But \u2013 I submit \u2013 even the most anti-Olympic Grinches, even the hardest-bitten cynics and Games-haters, will feel a batsqueak of excitement and patriotic pride as the curtain rises on the greatest show on earth.\n\nSuch moments in national life are routinely hailed by politicians as \u201cnon-political\u201d and \u201cabove politics\u201d. Of course, the opposite is true. Yes, Tessa Jowell (who, more than anyone else, has steered these Games from underdog bid to glorious reality) and Seb Coe, the doughty chairman of the organising committee and an Olympic hero in his own right, have transcended party in their decade-long partnership. But, ever since Pierre de Coubertin revived the Olympic tradition, the Games have positively groaned with political significance. It is no accident that Tony Blair, whose sleepless diplomacy did much to secure victory for London in 2005, has returned to the fray now to advise Labour on the Olympic legacy.\n\nNo 10, for its part, is all too aware that David Cameron cannot be seen to be \u201cmuscling in\u201d on the Games \u2013 but also knows an opportunity when one comes knocking on its lustrous black door. Hence, I am told, the PM will be chairing regular meetings of Cobra, the Civil Contingencies Committee, to ensure that all is going smoothly at the Olympic Park. There will be plenty of prime ministerial schmoozing with international businesses, too. Whether or not the Olympics will indeed boost the UK economy by more than \u00a313 billion over the next four years \u2013 as Cameron predicts \u2013 is impossible to say. But host governments have always seen economic hope etched into the sacred rings. When London last hosted the Games 64 years ago, senior ministers were no less optimistic about the potential bounty. \u201cThere are few better ways of making such a net contribution to the balance of payments with so little offset in the form of imported materials,\u201d Herbert Morrison wrote to Attlee in 1947.\n\nAt a more primitive level, there will be a totally unacknowledged but completely obvious battle between the PM and Boris Johnson to assert brand ownership of the Games. Anyone who has been near a mainline train station in London recently will have heard the Mayor\u2019s unmistakable tones in a recorded message urging all of us \u201cfolks\u201d to plan ahead when making journeys during the Olympics. For which read: these are the Boris Games.\n\nThose Tories who are militantly opposed to the idea of the Mayor as Cameron\u2019s successor are worried that the Games will be the most sensational leadership campaign launch in history. They are right to be concerned: Boris will have plenty of opportunities, ex officio, to go global in the weeks ahead, and his performance at the handover in Beijing four years ago shows that he thrives under this sort of spotlight. But the flipside is that all the bad stuff will be laid at the mayoral door, too. If London snarls to a grisly halt during the Games, so too might Boris\u2019s ambitions.\n\nLike a Rorschach test, the spectacle and scale of the Olympics allow observers to draw whatever ideological conclusions they please. You see what you want to see: John Pilger writes in the current New Statesman of \u201cthe London Olympics\u2019 razor-wired, PR-and-money-fuelled totalitarian state within a state\u201d. Others regard the 2012 Games as a festival of soggy multi-culturalism and (our old friend) \u201cPC gone mad\u201d. In the fiasco of G4S and its awesome failure to provide sufficient security personnel for the Games, some have detected yet another parable of free market failure and of \u201ccontracting out\u201d to the private sector. In the Border Agency strike threatened by the PCS union, meanwhile, others have scented a sour whiff of the Seventies, proof that the unionised public sector can be relied upon only to sabotage what really matters.\n\nI think it is hazardous \u2013 and wildly premature \u2013 to pronounce upon the ideological lessons of these Games. But when the audit comes, it will surely find that truth lies in the Blairite maxim now adopted by the Cameroons: what counts is what works. Philosophers call this \u201cmodel agnosticism\u201d. The rest of us call it common sense. Without the state-subsidised Army and police riding to the rescue, G4S\u2019s failure would have become a catastrophe. Without reform of union law, the public sector\u2019s supervision of our borders will become untenable: a prime case for the \u201ccontracting out\u201d that has been so criticised in recent days.\n\nOne of the great British exports is irony. It is entirely appropriate that in the superb comedy series, Twenty Twelve, we satirised our own Games pre-emptively: no other nation on earth would do that. True Britishness straddles the boundary that separates irony from determination. We are capable of mocking ourselves but also \u2013 when it counts \u2013 of Corinthian grit. The trick is striking the right balance.\n\nI am always suspicious of politicians who blame everything on \u201cmedia cynicism\u201d when what they really mean is that they don\u2019t like their press coverage. But there is a deeper point at issue in all this \u2013 in these Games \u2013 which is that no country can long prosper if its default setting is to be jaded, its aspirations are moribund, and its reserves of trust exhausted. The struggle to regain that trust, to rekindle that aspiration, is and will continue to be the story of this Coalition. So, too, it is the story of the London 2012 Games; and, in the final analysis, of our times.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02318/classifications_2318010g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02283/olympicPark_2283677b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02283/olympicPark_2283677k.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01805/Matthewd_Ancona_60_1805073j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02325/storey_2325402g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02283/olympicPark_2283677k.jpg", "date": "21/07/2012"}, "rank_11": {"title": "London 2012 planners 'did everything right' with Olympics legacy, say Australians", "text": "Australia\u2019s biggest city, widely praised for hosting the best Olympics , today faces an \"ongoing catastrophe\" over failures to adequately plan for life after the Games, one of the country's leading commentators said.\n\nSydney\u2019s Olympic Park , in the city\u2019s western suburbs, today resembles a \u201cghost town\u201d as government blunders leave the \u201cgenial garden-party feel\u201d of 12 years ago largely forgotten, she wrote.\n\nElizabeth Farrelly, an Adjunct Associate-Professor of Architecture at the University of Sydney, criticised the city\u2019s legacy plan as \u201clamentable\u201d, which London has \u201ccomprehensively\u201d trounced.\n\nThe Sydney-based author, who holds a PhD in architecture, said London 2012 officials \u201cdid everything right\u201d in their legacy planning and \u201cat every strategic turn, where we made wrong decisions, they made right ones\u201d.\n\nConsequently the local New South Wales government faces an \u201congoing catastrophe\u201d over its wasted investment of almost $2 billion (\u00a31.34 billion) on the new Homebush Bay suburb.\n\nThe former Sydney City Councillor said the area, about 10 miles west of the city centre, was now a \u201cghost town\u201d, with the main train line to the city operating \u201cfour times a day, off-peak, and not on weekends\u201d and a lack of any sense of vibrancy.\n\n\u201cLegacy depends far more on front-end strategy, connectivity decisions; location, urban fabric, transport,\u201d she wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Thursday, in an article titled \"Where the Brits have us beaten\".\n\n\u201cIt is not rocket science. Cities have always lived and died by connectivity. So it should be obvious that any Olympic legacy is only as good as its connectivity.\n\n\u201cYet Sydney, already tyrannised by distance, did everything possible to deny such connectivity, forever. It never made sense. Despite our best efforts, the place is a ghost town.\u201d\n\nA CGI impression of what the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park could look like post-Games (Picture: LEGACY COMPANY)\n\nIn comparison London planners identified a \u201crust-pocket that was accessible but seedy, needing help\u201d early on and created excellent transport links, such as the Docklands rail systems, close to the 560 acre Olympic Park.\n\nLondon also correctly decided to host events at city locations such as Hyde Park, Greenwich and the Mall so the \u201cQueen can watch cycling from a Buckingham Palace balcony and the plebs can watch beach volleyball in Horse Guards Parade\u201d.\n\nProblems were evident as early as 1990, three years before Sydney won its Games bid and a decade before it hosted the Olympics, as senior bureaucrats dismissed arguments to build the precinct in a centrally located area, such as Darling Harbour.\n\nBut officials also had an \u201camazing\u201d lack of plan to deal with toxic waste at ''one of the most contaminated sites in the world\u201d, no understanding of its location and link to the rest of the city while they also created \u201cidiotic\u201d transport proposals.\n\nThe Olympic Park at Stratford, east London, will be revamped into a new suburb called \"Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\" (Picture: GETTY IMAGES).\n\nThe London Legacy Development Corporation will revamp \u201cQueen Elizabeth Olympic Park\u201d, in Stratford, east London, into a regenerated district with 8,000 new homes, schools, nurseries and health centre.\n\nIt will also have new visitor attractions while the Olympics facilities will continue to be used for sporting events.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01779/Hough_60_1779714j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01855/southplaza_1855169b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02290/olympic-park_2290908b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02327/summary_2327839g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02293/olympic_park_2293476c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02293/olympic_park_2293476b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01855/northparkcresent_1855163b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01451/aquatics-centre_1451980b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/athletes-summary_2334882g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/parade-fans_2334695g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02289/Sydney-2000-Olympi_2289044c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01855/futurepark_1855167c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02292/London-2012-olympi_2292781a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02289/Sydney-2000-Olympi_2289044b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02292/London-2012-olympi_2292781a.jpg", "date": "02/08/2012"}, "rank_21": {"title": "An Olympic blueprint for a better Britain", "text": "Those watching the Olympics this week may have been left with a certain ringing in their ears \u2013 not from the cheers of the crowd, or the thump of the stadium sound systems, but from the thunderous sound of preconceptions being shattered. Those who delighted in arguing that London 2012 would be a flop \u2013 that a dismal, second-class nation such as Britain could never raise its game to the required heights \u2013 have been robustly confounded. All the pre-Games fretting about the logistics, the transport, the security, have thus far proved largely groundless. Instead, the public, and our foreign guests, have found themselves in a kind of Wonderland version of Britain, in which everything works, everything comes off, and everyone smiles all the time.\n\nWhere does this feeling come from? An explanation is found in the work of Sir John Keegan, this newspaper\u2019s eminent former defence editor, who died this week. His greatest achievement as a military historian was to write from the perspective of the soldier rather than the general, to treat war as a bottom-up rather than a top-down affair. So it is with the Olympics. It may have been the politicians and sporting bureaucrats who bid for the Games and constructed the venues, and the sponsors who emblazoned them with their logos. But the most striking feature of London 2012 has been the sense of public ownership, a whole-hearted and near-unanimous enjoyment of and participation in the whole enterprise. It is something shaped by enlightened decisions from above \u2013 such as the light touch and relaxed professionalism shown by stewards, security personnel and officials \u2013 and by the exemplary performance of so many of the home nation\u2019s sportsmen. But it is also something that no politician or bureaucrat could have ordained. To call them the \u201cPeople\u2019s Games\u201d is a clich\u00e9, yet they have become precisely that.\n\nFor a nation that has recently seemed unsure of its place in the world, the reception that the Games have received offers a certain reassurance. We are suddenly realising, as we did during the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee, that we do not need to present ourselves to others as ancient or modern, traditional or radical, but simply as the nation we are \u2013 which happens to be a nation that the world rather likes. This comfort with the many layers of our national identity was perfectly reflected by the Olympic opening ceremony\u2019s blend of whimsy and spectacle, and has been reinforced with every shot of beach volleyball players in Horse Guards Parade, or horses leaping towards the distant spires of Docklands from the eventing course in Greenwich Park. Indeed, given the chance to see ourselves as the world sees us, through the prism of the television lenses, we are learning to appreciate the beauty of our capital in new and delightful ways.\n\nWhat is most encouraging about the Olympics, however, is the way they have raised the national mood \u2013 or rather, transformed it. A culture often dominated by cynicism, pessimism and complaint is experiencing the heady effects of a daily infusion of optimism and joy. The pleasure is all the greater because of the bittersweet aftertaste, the knowledge that it cannot and will not last: we may summon some of the same happy spirit for the Paralympic Games, but by and large, at the end of the closing ceremony, the party will be well and truly over.\n\nWhich raises the question: what next? Will this happy spirit simply vanish, snuffed out alongside the Olympic cauldron? Certainly, the empty streets in central London suggest that the promised economic boost will be hard to come by. There will be a sporting legacy, not least in the form of the stunning venues that will now be put at the community\u2019s service.

Here are the facts.\n\nAfter 10,000 playing fields were sold off between 1979 and 1997, it was the Labour Government that legislated to ensure that they were protected.\n\nFor the first time, sales of any part of a playing field would require support of the Secretary of State. Less than 200 applications to sell off playing fields were granted in the next ten years.\n\nThe myth that we outlawed competitive sport is absolute rubbish. Over the course of a decade, we both promoted it and funded it.\n\nA decade of investment, through school sports partnerships, was yielding real results, giving young people in state schools the same sporting opportunities that had long been enjoyed in private schools.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010, the number of young people doing at least two or more hours of sport per week rose from 25% to 90%. The number of boys and girls taking part in sport outside lessons almost doubled.\n\nThere was a real and visible change in the range of sports that are offered in schools. Fifteen years ago, if you weren\u2019t any good at football, netball or cross-country, there often wasn\u2019t much sport on offer for you.\n\nBy 2010, the average secondary school offered 25 different sports \u2013 including Olympic sports such as judo, cycling and badminton where we have seen so much progress in recent years.\n\nHalf-baked accusations about the last decade\u2019s sporting developments are dangerous not just because they are simply untrue, but because they also make it more difficult to have an honest and open debate about how we improve sport both in our schools and in our country.\n\nIn the 1996 Atlanta Games, Great Britain came 36th in the medal table \u2013 our worst-ever Olympic performance, which followed two decades of underinvestment. Through finishing fourth in the medals table at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Team GB recorded our best ever performance in the modern Olympics.\n\nThis has been accompanied by a substantial increase in participation in grass roots sport \u2013 which has seen a million more people playing sport at least three times per week since 2005.\n\nImproved elite performance and grassroots participation does not simply happen by accident.\n\nIt requires the active support of Government, both in funding the necessary infrastructure and putting the right systems in place to support its development.\n\nThat is why a total funding package of \u00a32 billion to support elite, grassroots and school sport in the run up to the London Games \u2013 targeted at sports that could demonstrate success \u2013 and a schools sport system that was the envy of the world.\n\nBut two years ago, at the stroke of a Minister\u2019s pen, we saw the Government cut funding for school sport and dismantle school sports partnerships.\n\nThis was a devastating blow to sport in schools and to the ambition to be the first Olympic Games which could point to a public health legacy.\n\nSchool sport partnerships have been so successful that they have been reproduced in Canada, Brazil and even our arch-rivals Australia.\n\nTheir incomprehensible abolition has seen a 60% reduction in the amount of time spent organising sport in schools.\n\nAny debate around improving sport in our schools needs to look at how we can re-create this world-beating system.\n\nThe Olympic and Paralympic Games are a once in a lifetime event that will get young people excited about sport. It is important that schools are able to maintain this momentum and help young people develop sport and exercise as a habit that will keep them healthy and fit for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn the spirit of cross-party co-operation that has marked the success of the Olympics, let us apply the same determination to creating the legacy we promised \u2013 to inspire a generation through sport, here in Great Britain and across the world.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02173/londonOlympics_2173231a.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02173/londonOlympics_2173231c.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/parade-fans_2334695g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/athletes-summary_2334882g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02327/summary_2327839g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02173/londonOlympics_2173231a.jpg", "date": "03/08/2012"}, "rank_165": {"title": "Olympic legacy: Coalition axes school sports targets", "text": "Amid continuing debate over the Olympic legacy, it was revealed that the Department for Education is no longer forcing state schools to provide 120 minutes of PE and sport.\n\nThe Coalition insisted that head teachers should be given the freedom to organise physical activity themselves instead of following a \u201cbureaucratic system\u201d.\n\nIt was also feared that many schools were shunning competitive sport and favouring disciplines such as yoga and circus skills to hit targets imposed by the previous Labour government.\n\nBut the move will raise fears that some children may not be getting access to the necessary amount of exercise every week.\n\nThe disclosure comes just days after Jeremy Hunt, the Culture Secretary, admitted that school sports provision was still too patchy.\n\nIt was also revealed this week that Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, has approved the sale of more than 20 school playing fields since the last General Election.\n\nOfficials insisted most became surplus when existing schools closed or amalgamated.\n\nBut the figures could prove embarrassing for the Government as the nation continues to be swept along by the success of the London Olympics and Team GB\u2019s medal haul.\n\nToday, the Youth Sport Trust criticised the decision to scrap the two hour PE target, claiming it was now difficult to identify which schools were failing to provide enough lessons.\n\n\u201cMeasuring the number of young people participating in two hours of school sport did give a clear indication of participation levels in sport in schools across the country,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThere is still some great work going on in schools but it is now more difficult to know exactly where provision is good and where it needs to be improved.\u201d\n\nUnder the previous Government, all children of compulsory school age were expected to take part in two hours of sport a week. By 2009/10, some 86 per cent of pupils were meeting the target.\n\nLabour later outlined a long-term goal of ensuring children did five hours a week of physical activity during lesson time or after school.\n\nAs part of a new school sport strategy published in late 2010, the Coalition axed the last Government\u2019s targets \u2013 including the new \u201cfive hour offer\u201d \u2013 claiming they led to a decline in the number of children taking part in traditionally competitive sports such as rugby union, netball and hockey. A sports census completed by schools every year was also scrapped.\n\nBut a statement released at the time suggested that all schools would be expected to \u201ccontinue providing two hours a week of PE and sport\u201d.\n\nToday, the Department for Education insisted that this was no longer the case.\n\n\u201cInstead of handing down target and quotas from Whitehall, we have chosen to trust teachers and parents when it comes to deciding how much sport pupils should do,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\n\u201cWe want to strip away the red tape that takes up too much time teachers should be using to teach, run sports clubs or plan lessons. In the past, schools were heavily over-burdened with paperwork and form-filling.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier this week, Mr Hunt said: \u201cI think at the moment school sport provision is patchy in some places, and we need to do what we can to make sure that the very best examples are spread throughout the whole country, and this is absolutely going to be a focus over the next few months and one of the things that we really want to take away from these Games.\"\n\nTeam GB Olympians with degrees\n\nLive webchat: University Clearing - how does it work?\n\nClearing 2012: Telegraph to host live University Clearing place finder", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03075/rsz_fotolia_projec_3075216g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9459469/ https:/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03186/IAB_Student_Life_4_3186316a.gif", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/Wombat-1-e_3602888g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02762/primary_summary_2762979g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01394/running_1394484c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03068/Postgrad_piggy_ban_3068937g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/grandad_3602577g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01394/running_1394484a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02460/summaryImageAlev46_2460324g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03098/Richard-Harman_3098947g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03199/15174814041_17ed2f_3199087g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02079/bad-exams_2079369g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03000/Fotolia_Coding_Man_3000733g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03214/CF-140x87_3214162g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03549/scientist-in-lab_3549159g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02460/summaryImages460px_2460321g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01817/Graeme-Paton_60_1817929j.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01394/running_1394484a.jpg", "date": "07/08/2012"}, "rank_18": {"title": "Olympic legacy: 21 school fields sold off in two years", "text": "Despite a promise to safeguard playing fields from development, Education Secretary Michael Gove has approved the sale of 21 since the Coalition was formed.\n\nThe figures, released by the Department of Education, were announced in the middle of what could be one of Britain's most successful Olympic Games , featuring athletes who first tried their sports while at school.\n\nTeam GB's first medal winner, Lizzie Armitstead has said she would have never thought to try cycling if her PE teacher had not organised a visit from British Cycling's talent team.\n\nSome schools, including Winchcombe school in Newbury, Berkshire, have lost their playing fields to housing developments while others have been sold after schools were closed, according to the Guardian.\n\nAt Woodhouse school in Staffordshire, a new school was built on the playing fields while Kingsbury high school in Brent, north London, will lease its playing fields to a five-a-side pitch firm.\n\nCulture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, whose brief includes the Olympics, said more National Lottery money was being pumped into sport but admitted there was \"patchy\" provision within sports.\n\n\"I think at the moment school sport provision is patchy in some places, and we need to do what we can to make sure that the very best examples are spread throughout the whole country, and this is absolutely going to be a focus over the next few months and one of the things that we really want to take away from these Games,\" he told the Guardian.\n\nEarlier this year, Prince Harry spoke out against developments on school playing fields as he awarded prizes to the winners of the London Marathon.\n\nHe said charities like Fields in Trust were important because \"everyone wants to build everywhere nowadays\".\n\nA DfE spokeswoman said the sale of sports fields would only be approved if the schools' need could still be met.\n\nShe said that 14 fields belonged to schools that had closed, four were sites that became surplus when existing schools amalgamated and one was spare \"marginal grassland\" on a school site, whose sale was invested in a new library and sports changing facilities.

Only about four in 10 children regularly take part in such sports.\n\nMany clubs are seeing a surge of interest from the young but do not have the resources to offer them the opportunities that could help produce future medal winners.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph today launches the Keep the Flame Alive campaign to increase volunteering and return competitive sport to all schools.\n\n\u201cI started doing athletics when I was nine years old,\u201d Ennis said. \u201cI had loads of support from my school and PE teachers.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really important to have great sport in schools and teach it well and obviously create great role models. That will make a huge, huge difference.\u201d She said it was important to \u201cteach kids that it is not a bad thing to be competitive\u201d and that she hoped some of the thousands of volunteers and visitors to the Olympics would be inspired to help run local clubs.\n\nThe Prime Minister welcomed the campaign as attention would shortly turn to the legacy of the London Olympics, whose motto is \u201cinspire a generation\u201d. \u201cFor the moment everyone is revelling in a golden summer of British sport, with Britain showing the world what we can deliver in all sorts of ways,\u201d said Mr Cameron. \u201cBut in a few days it will be time to focus on the legacy and I welcome the intervention and ideas of the Telegraph and its readers.\u201d\n\nJeremy Hunt, the Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said that action in schools and local communities was essential to the legacy of the Games.\n\n\u201cThe Olympics have highlighted what a fantastic sporting nation Britain is and we want to harness that inspiration to ensure that more children take part in competitive sport,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe past few weeks have shown the importance of competitive sport and we want to ensure it is at the heart of the legacy left behind after the Olympics.\u201d\n\nLabour added its support to the drive to protect the Olympic legacy, with Dame Tessa Jowell calling for a cross-party consensus on school sports and a ten-year plan to build on the public enthusiasm for the Games.\n\nThe Shadow Minister for the Olympics said it was time to put arguments about what happened in the past behind us and focus on the future.\n\nThe important question was \u201chow do we get every child having sport as part of their lives and how do we get children competing for the sake not only of children developing their sporting potential but also for the read-across to other parts of children\u2019s lives?\u201d she told the BBC, adding: \u201cSchools that major on sports often show better academic results.\u201d\n\nMs Jowell said: \"This has got to go all the way from the child coming into reception class in primary school, taking part in PE, right through to our extraordinary medallists.\n\n\"Chris Hoy is absolutely right, it has been the investment in elite training which has created stability for high performance training for those athletes. We have got to make sure that money continues.\"\n\nOlympic athletes lined up to back the call for a change in culture. Michael Jamieson, silver medallist in the 200 metre breaststroke, said: \u201cI started at a small community run club, Scotia, in Bishopbriggs, Glasgow, and all the coaches were volunteers. Without them I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nNick Dempsey, 31, who won a silver in windsurfing, added: \u201cAt the end of the day, sport is about competition and it\u2019s about learning to deal with the emotions involved.\u201d\n\nHowever, there are concerns that schools will struggle to cope with the expected rise in interest in sport. Fatima Whitbread, the former world champion javelin thrower, said: \u201cWhat concerns me is a sudden influx of young people coming into sports clubs and the schools are going to struggle.\u201d\n\nThere were also suggestions that schools did not place enough emphasis on sport, which was often eclipsed by a focus on academic performance.\n\nBlack, who won a silver medal in the 400m in 1996, told ITV\u2019s Daybreak programme: \u201cWe have to recognise the importance of sport to schools.\n\n\u201cThe problem is sport is just way down the agenda when it comes to the time children spend at school. It\u2019s just not taken seriously enough.\u201d\n\nThe Government has already faced accusations that it was undermining sport with the potential removal of funding.\n\nThe Prime Minister insisted that simply spending more was not the solution. \u201cThe problem has been too many schools not wanting to have competitive sport, some teachers not wanting to join in and play their part,\u201d Mr Cameron said.\n\n\u201cSo if we want to have a great sporting legacy for our children \u2014 and I do \u2014 we have got to have an answer that brings the whole of society together to crack this, more competition, more competitiveness, more getting rid of the idea you can\u2019t have competitive sports days. We need a big cultural change \u2014 a cultural change in favour of competitive sports.\u201d\n\nBut for many athletes, funding has also been essential to their success.\n\nTrott, the double gold cycling medallist, told The Independent: \u201cFunding is very important \u2013 it is the key to our sport, really. We would be lost without it.\u201d\n\nAnd Sir Matthew, the Olympic rowing gold medallist, warned that funding cuts could hit swimming, gymnastics, equestrianism and triathlon, arguing that \u201cthe only solution is to give sport a higher priority.\u201d\n\nWriting in The Times, he said: \u201cPerennially it is dismissed as a side issue in Whitehall, a little add-on in the Department of Culture and Media.\u201d\n\nBut identifying talent \u201cneeds money and commitments from politicians who, far too often are used to making decisions that pay off while they are still in office,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics say that sport in state schools began to suffer in the 1980s, when councils started selling playing fields and industrial action by teachers\u2019 unions resulted in staff refusing to run sports during lunch breaks or after hours.\n\nTeachers said that the claim that they did not want to take part in school sports was \u201cextremely rude\u201d and that the biggest threat to physical education was cuts in funding. The National Union of Teachers called the Prime Minister\u2019s comments \u201cfoolhardy\u201d.\n\nAlan Watkinson, the former PE teacher of Mo Farah, the 10,000m champion, said: \u201cWe need to look much broader than teachers.\n\n\u201cSuccessive governments have asked teachers to do more and more.\n\n\u201cTeachers work extremely hard. We need to look outside of that, we need to look at teaching assistants, people in administration roles, community and parents.\u201d\n\nLabour said the Government had removed a target for each child to do at least two hours\u2019 sport a week.

This newspaper has launched Keep the Flame Alive to ensure a lasting legacy from the London Games, the most successful for British athletes in more than a century.\n\nThe campaign has already been backed by leading politicians and athletes including Jessica Ennis, the gold-medal winning heptathlete. Yesterday, more medal-winners added their voices.\n\nAlistair Brownlee, who won gold in the triathlon, said: \u201cOne of the biggest things about legacy is that it\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about the attitude. It\u2019s about inspiring teachers at schools to go that little bit further to help their kids learn a sport. It\u2019s about inspiring the kids themselves to try sport. I wholeheartedly back the Telegraph\u2019s initiative.\u201d\n\nLouis Smith, who won a silver and a bronze in the gymnastics, said: \u201cWe have had volunteers in and out of the gym throughout my whole life \u2013 people who sacrifice their time to come in and help.\u201d\n\nHe promised to volunteer after the Games. \u201cI want to give so much back to the sport and really see how far we can take British gymnastics,\u201d he said.\n\nPaula Radcliffe, the women\u2019s marathon world record holder, speaking at an Olympic legacy event in London, said: \u201cThe biggest failure that we made in sport in this country was stopping competitive sports in schools. That has to come back. All kids are competitive and it\u2019s about channelling that and giving them an outlet for it.\u201d She missed out on London 2012 because of a foot injury.\n\nCycling expects a particularly large increase in popularity following the extraordinary success of the British team. David Brailsford, head of British Cycling, said that volunteers were vital. \u201cThere have to be people running sport where parents feel confident that their kids can go there and they\u2019re in good hands,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview with today\u2019s Daily Telegraph, Sir Chris Hoy discloses the important role played by his great uncle in encouraging amateur athletes, and urges others to follow suit. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go on to be an Olympian but he was a world-class mile runner who came back from being a prisoner of the Japanese not the same as when he went out there,\u201d said the six-times gold-medal winner.\n\n\u201cThen he started an athletics club in Carnoustie and inspired people to get into sport.

Two tiny children stroking the nose of a police horse; a squirrel eating nuts from a soldier\u2019s rucksack; a young man helping 80,000 people across the road.\n\nLondon 2012 has, at times, seemed like a throwback to an older, gentler Britain, where kindness and generosity were the order of the day. There may be towering fences and huge steel roadblocks surrounding the Olympic venues, but in and around those compounds a different spirit has been allowed to flourish.\n\nNever before in this century have you seen so many people draped in the British flag. It has become the fashion accessory of the moment, thrown elegantly over shoulders, tied around jeans, worn as a jaunty plastic bowler, painted on cheeks and nails, vigorously waved.\n\nThat adoption of the flag is more than superficial. It is a symbol of the pride that people have felt as the athletes on the track, the sailors and rowers, the dancing horses and their riders, the cyclists, the fighters and swimmers, have struggled and shone for Team GB. In turn, that slightly clumsy ad man\u2019s phrase has come to feel like a truth: we are all in this together, a country united.\n\nNo wonder people\u2019s attention has turned to legacy, to keeping these feelings alive when the Games have gone, and the Olympic flame is just a fading photograph, not a real cauldron. Just as inevitably, the second that politicians open their mouths, divisions that have been disguised open up. David Cameron says it is important to encourage competitive sport and that the Government is spending a billion doing just that. Ed Miliband points out that the Coalition has savagely cut the funding for the School Sport Partnerships, which linked state school pupils with professional coaches.\n\nBoth parries seem like political platitudes set against the immensity of the big picture that the 30th Olympiad has brought into focus. It is in that sense that Danny Boyle\u2019s opening ceremony was so significant: a vision of a country where soldiers were important, but so were trade unionists; where town and country both had a role; where the family was central; where people were full of ideas and worked for the common good. It was an image of a value system as well as an entertainment.\n\nSo when we try to draw lessons from the Games, instead of bandying words around, we should pause, think and recall the moments we have witnessed, creating a kind of manifesto of memories which will stand us in good stead in the bleak months ahead.\n\nOne of our first acts should be to acknowledge something we knew but had half forgotten \u2013 that we are actually quite good at this kind of thing. We can build a huge temporary city within our capital, welcome thousands of extra visitors, and make it work.\n\nSecurity has been tight, but it has never been overwhelming. Early-morning runners in Hyde Park could jog without being disrupted by the professionals undertaking the triathlon; normal life has gone on. Public transport has been stretched but continued to function. The flow system guiding more than 100,000 people from the Olympic Park to their various Tubes and trains is worthy of a Nobel prize.\n\nThat efficiency looks back to the past, but should continue. The Games have allowed Britain, almost for the first time in memory, to celebrate its history while acknowledging its rich multicultural present, which is now leading the way into the future. We have seen a country at ease with its past, capable of sticking a ritzy beach volleyball court in the middle of Horse Guards Parade, or its monarch in a sketch about a spy and a helicopter. But that narrative must also encompass the tolerance that welcomed Mo Farah when he arrived as a child from Somalia \u2013 and which has been rewarded with one of the best pictures of the Games, the sight of Britain\u2019s greatest distance runner wrapped in a flag, hugging his wife and child, applauded to the skies.\n\nThe exploits of our sportsmen and women, the memories they have conjured, have been inspiring in all sorts of ways. After this Olympics, nobody can claim that women\u2019s sports are second best. Every little girl who went to Wembley to see US v Japan, or caught a glimpse of the British women\u2019s team\u2019s valiant efforts on TV, will know once and for all that football doesn\u2019t belong to blokes, it belongs to them as well. There are girls\u2019 football leagues across Britain that should benefit.\n\nAs for Nicola Adams and her Irish counterpart, Katie Taylor, they have not only made redundant any arguments about the rightness of women boxing, they have also revealed their discipline in all its glory, as a sport of strength, speed and grace, not slugging in corners. Their legacy will be huge.\n\nBut the athletes have also offered a view of Britain as a complete society, North and South, rich and poor. On this team, the dressage gold-medal winner Charlotte Dujardin on her horse worth millions happily rubs shoulders with Louis Smith, the gymnast whose single mum drove him on a 52-mile round trip to the gym each day; Jessica Ennis, of mixed-race, working class stock from Sheffield, is a gold medal winner alongside Anna Watkins and Katherine Grainger, top-class scullers and studying for doctorates. All human life is here, whether it has subsisted on a diet of potatoes and pasta without funding, like Adams, or been fast-tracked to success.\n\nIn this context, the memories of the Games have to encompass those who have been excluded from the stadium as well as those lucky enough to get a ticket. Talent exists everywhere, in the estates of Hackney, Haringey and Salford, in suburban homes as well as on the lawns of public schools. If these Olympics are to be more than the bread and circuses claimed by the naysayers, then those gifts must be recognised and encouraged just as fiercely wherever they are found.\n\nIf children languishing in difficult circumstances can suddenly feel that they can change their lives, they can dream and have the means to fulfil those dreams, then the legacy of this Games will be immense.\n\nBut to do that they don\u2019t just need politicians to stop point-scoring and start trying to make a practical difference on the ground in every impoverished and undernourished community. They also need the great silent majority who have revelled in the atmosphere of this Games to assert their sense of what living in a good community means. You nurture ability on the one hand, but on the other you must respect your fellow citizens.\n\nIn this sense, the abiding image of London 2012 has not been the triumphant smiles and tears of Bradley Wiggins, Sir Chris Hoy and the victorious cyclists, or the joy of the other medal winners; it has been the great, anonymous mass of volunteers, dressed in unflattering (but strangely welcoming) purple, pink and red, directing visitors around London. Some of the 70,000 have glimpsed the action inside the Olympic venues; others have done nothing more glamorous than direct human traffic at the transport hubs.\n\nBut they have done so with resolute cheerfulness and good will, bringing virtues of humour and irony to a task that has made their instructions a million miles from the meaningless \u201cHave a good day\u201d. At St Pancras, as the crowds waited for the super-fast Javelin train emblazoned with Rebecca Adlington\u2019s name to take them to the Park, a young rail worker shouted through a megaphone: \u201cYou will not be allowed on the train without\u2026\u201d\n\nEveryone bristled, waiting for some petty instruction. \u201c\u2026a smile on your face\u201d. The entire platform broke out laughing.\n\nIt is a simple enough thing, but it has worked. For the duration of the Olympics, London has put a smile on its face. Britain has begun to remember the country it can be. In the hard times of recession ahead, when we are still trying to build for the future, the real legacy of the Games must be that determination to be generous to each other. Nurture talent, show respect and smile. Not a bad manifesto of memories.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03000/Fotolia_Coding_Man_3000733g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02282/vet_getty_2282871g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03075/rsz_fotolia_projec_3075216g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02306/young_2306532a.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02297/eton_2297105g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02384/sarah-crompton-60x_2384719j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02296/pendleton-seatedsm_2296627g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/keep-the-flame-alive/9467023/ https:/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03186/IAB_Student_Life_4_3186316a.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02306/young_2306532b.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03199/15174814041_17ed2f_3199087g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02243/Aviva_school_crick_2243063g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03214/CF-140x87_3214162g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01673/consultant_1673824g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03068/Postgrad_piggy_ban_3068937g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02306/young_2306532a.jpg", "date": "10/08/2012"}, "rank_46": {"title": "Boris Johnson tells David Cameron to 'go for growth' to harness Olympic legacy", "text": "In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph , Mr Johnson urged ministers to take bold steps on housing, infrastructure and regulation to take full advantage of the confidence and international respect hosting a successful games has won Britain.\n\nFor the past two weeks Mr Johnson has been basking in the reflected glory of an Olympic Games almost universally considered a rip-roaring success \u2013 at a time when the economy is labouring in recession, five years on from the start of the economic crisis.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing about the Olympics is that they have shown that Britain really can do things,\u201d the Mayor said. \u201cWe have shown the world we are a happy, ambitious, modern, successful economy.\n\n\"We have shown incredible logistical skills. We now have every reason to be in confident in ourselves and the future.\u201d\n\nBut Mr Johnson said London \u2013 and Britain with it \u2013 still remains beset with barriers that stand in the way of economic growth and he seems unimpressed with the pace of the Coalition\u2019s reforms.\n\n\u201cThey need to go further,\u201d Mr Johnson said of the Government. \u201cThey need a series of supply-side reforms. London really can be the motor of our economic recovery.\u201d\n\nThe Mayor\u2019s words echo the concerns of other leading lights of the Conservative Party. Many of the party\u2019s Right wing \u2013 including Liam Fox, the former defence secretary - feel that the chancellor, George Osborne, and his fellow ministers are failing to deliver the business-friendly policies vital to power our debt-laden economy out of recession.\n\nThe Institute of Directors, a leading business lobby group has also attacked the \u201cglacial speed\u201d of Coalition\u2019s reforms designed to encourage firms to hire and invest.\n\nIt is a claim denied by Coalition ministers including William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, who has argued that the Government has done a great deal to help the economy and that it\u2019s up to businesses and individuals to get out there and make the recovery happen.\n\nStung by criticism that Government is not doing enough on growth, ministers are drawing up an economic regeneration bill for the autumn that will outline a range of new infrastructure projects and measures to cut business red tape.\n\nSorting out the congestion above London\u2019s skies is a priority, the Mayor said.\n\n\u201cWe need a new airport \u2013 whether it is in the Thames estuary or wherever, I don\u2019t care. But we need to address that problem. An extra runway at Heathrow alone won\u2019t do it \u2013 it would be full in a flash.\u201d\n\nJustine Greening, the Transport Secretary, was supposed to publish a new consultation document setting out the Government\u2019s aviation strategy by mid-July, but this has been shelved until the autumn.\n\nThe delays are infuriating many in the business community keen to land deals in fast-growing emerging markets.\n\nMr Johnson also wants more river crossings in London, extra money to extend to tube lines and \u201cCrossrail II\u201d. The first of these new underground railways running beneath London is set to be completed in 2017.\n\nAs soon as the first Crossrail opens he wants work to begin on a second new line, running between Chelsea in the west and Hackney in the east.\n\nThe Mayor said more needs to be done and quickly to streamline Britain\u2019s planning system to pave the way for a housing boom.\n\nEarlier this year the Government published its National Planning Policy Framework which aimed to make it is easier for developers to build houses, but official figures suggest house building remains subdued.\n\n\u201cWe need to build hundreds of thousands of new homes. If we invest in a huge building programme, put in a lot of public sector land, de-risk it for the developers and get the construction sector going again it will start to drive the economy.\u201d\n\nThere is already a serious housing shortage in parts of London, but this situation could become acute by the next decade when London is expected to surpass New York as the world city with the highest population.\n\n\u201cLondon\u2019s population is going to reach 9 million in the next decade,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should not be paranoid about this \u2013 we are only now getting up to the levels reached in 1939 or 1911. There is room for great regeneration in the east.\u201d\n\nHowever, there needs to be jobs for this burgeoning population and the Mayor also insisted the Coalition must do more to make it easier for firms to hire and fire, especially for businesses with five workers or less.\n\nMany on the Right of the Conservative Party remain dismayed that the Government failed to implement many bold recommendations made by the financier Adrian Beecroft in a Downing Street report on employment law reform.\n\nIn the last few weeks around 4,000 businessmen, foreign officials and other potential investors have shuffled into the Mayor\u2019s Thameside offices where he has sold rundown parts of the capital \u2013 including Battersea Power Station, Brent Cross, Croydon and Tottenham \u2013 as lucrative investment opportunities.\n\nThe digital businesses Facebook and Amazon are set to create new jobs in the capital over the coming months, but only time will tell if more follow.\n\nThe critics may have fallen silent while Team GB was winning gold medals, but once the games end tonight the questions about their legacy will begin.\n\nThe futures of two of the Olympic Park\u2019s venues \u2013 including the stadium \u2013 remain undecided.\n\nMr Johnson was typically bullish about the prospect of future Olympic champions learning their skills in the aquatic centre. Again, only time will tell if these grand building remain largely unused in the future.\n\nMr Johnson also spoke vigorously about the army of \u201cgames makers\u201d, thousands of volunteers who have sprung to life across the City.\n\nHe sees these people as the embodiment of Mr Cameron\u2019s Big Society. The London games apparently has a far higher retention rate of these volunteers than previous Olympic cities. Will these people remain on hand to encourage young Londoners to take up sport?\n\nOf course, it will be years before it will be possible to say whether the 2012 games\u2019 legacy was a success, by which time Mr Johnson will be doing a very different job. Conservative party leader or even Prime Minister, perhaps?\n\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d he roared in response to recent speculation that he is destined to replace Mr Cameron. \u201cNo serious student of politics could possible think that would happen.\u201d\n\nBut they certainly do and the London Mayor knows full well that his part in these memorable Olympics will ensure such speculation will continue.\n\nHe said he will not contest a third term as London mayor, but was uncharacteristically pianissimo when asked about what he plans to do after the 2016 election.\n\nHe dismissed the current tensions within the Coalition as \u201cclassic midtermery\u201d and can\u2019t resist joking that the Games helpfully presented \u201ca very good moment\u201d to discreetly ditch House of Lords reform - something he sounds about as enthusiastic about as a spin on the Olympic BMX track.\n\nHe described his past two weeks as a \u201cHimalayan range of exciting peaks\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been on my feet absolutely yelling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never been to a velodrome before. That was great. That sort of ritual the cyclists do like mating pigeons waggling their bottoms \u2013 I love it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he doesn\u2019t have a few regrets about the past couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be trying to get on a zip wire again in a hurry,\u201d he puffs, recalling the well-publicised gaffe which saw the accident-prone London mayor suspended high above a London park.\n\n\u201cAlthough in a way that was successful \u2013 it massively increased the popularity of the Victoria Park zip wire from a very low base.\u201d\n\nHe also seemed abashed that one of his savvy media advisors \u201cquashed\u201d a guest appearance in Twenty Twelve, the BBC spoof documentary about the London Olympics\u2019 organisers.\n\nWas there in any truth in the show\u2019s depiction of a gaggle of bumbling bureaucrats, some of whom seemed to be competing for a gold medal in political correctness?\n\n\u201cOh it was absolutely truthful. The endless conversations about inclusivity, sustainability, multiculturality, posterity\u2026\u201d.\n\nHe then erupted into giggles. \u201cWe had a lot of that. And the makers seemed to know some things that we were doing that weren\u2019t public. But there will be no mole hunt.\u201d\n\nHe used a typical \u201cBoJo\u201d turn of phrase to describe a meeting with Laura Trott, the double gold medal winning poster girl of cycling - a phrase which given his well-documtened personal life suggests he is still willing to sail close to the wind despite the added profile the Olympics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a date with Laura Trott,\u201d he said of the 20-year-old gold medal-winning cyclist who has agreed to front an annual London two-day festival of cycling, the first of which is set to take place next summer.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to teach me how to ride one of those carbon fibre bikes. I watched her win the Omnium \u2013 wow. She is like a whippet. And you meet her and she\u2019s tiny.\n\n\"You can\u2019t understand where the speed comes from.

Matthew Butturini struggled to keep simple passes in play while five time player of the year Jamie Dwyer was kept quiet by Iain Lewers.\n\nIf anything Australia were lucky to go ahead after 18 minutes when Simon Orchard struck from the top of the area.\n\nOn Thursday, Holland\u2019s first goal marked the start of a mauling but GB were calm and patient and their approach paid off 10 minutes later when the first penalty corner was awarded after the ball clipped Fergus Kavanagh in the area.\n\nIt was a sublime set piece. As expected, the feed went to Jackson who dummied his strike before sweeping the ball left where Iain Lewers was waiting to convert.\n\nLittle separated the sides but it all changed 11 minutes after the break when Australia called on the video umpire claiming the ball had struck Harry Martin\u2019s foot on a clearance.\n\nThe decision went their way and a penalty corner was given \u2014 the first of three in as many minutes.\n\nThe first two were cleared but the third was tapped in by Dwyer on the left post. From this point, Australia\u2019s attack was relentless and struck again 13 minutes from time when Kieran Govers tapped in a deflected striker. The medal belonged to Australia.\n\nWhen asked if he would lead the team to the 2016 Games in Rio, Lee said: \u201cIt\u2019s iffy to be honest. I\u2019m low on energy and I\u2019ve found this very challenging. I\u2019ve given my heart and soul to coaching for 25 years and there have been tears of joy and ocean of heartache.

Children should not be made to think that whoever crosses the finishing line first is rewarded, while another who is not the most talented can never hope for a certificate to mark a sporting achievement.\n\nThe Olympics are all about being the best you can be. None of us should forget that even those who have come away from London without gold medals are winners already, because they represent the best from their countries.\n\nThe people who finish last are still outstanding athletes in their own right, and this is the message we need to convey to young people: that they should always feel they are moving forward, that their sporting activity is a part of their lives and stays with them for the rest of their lives.\n\nAs has been demonstrated by Britain\u2019s remarkable accomplishments at London 2012, we need to widen the potential areas of success, not narrow them.\n\nIt concerns me, too, that by over-stressing the competitive side, we might be scaring off people who struggle with coordinated skills. My own sport, rowing, is highly coordinated.\n\nAs I was never the most academic pupil at Great Marlow comprehensive, I was fortunate to be persuaded to take it up at 14 by my English teacher, whose interest was rowing. But I recognise that a lot of youngsters do not have the same co-ordination, and that their abilities still need to be maximised.\n\nI am the chairman of a company called Personal-Best International, which has been driven by the conviction that people are capable of far more than they believe, that everybody can achieve a personal best.\n\nThis is the ethos we should impart to children committed to sport. But we must also make the most of our talent identification schemes.\n\nIn 2007, as president of UK Sport\u2019s Sporting Giants programme, I sent out a message in a newspaper to girls who were at least 5ft 9in tall: \u201cDo you want to be a part of 2012? Would you like to be going for medals at the Olympic Games?\u201d\n\nHelen Glover was one of the people we discovered, and she has just won Olympic gold for Britain in the women\u2019s pair.\n\nI conveyed my views about the direction of Government policy to David Cameron during the Olympics, and I am hoping to arrange a further meeting with him after the Paralympics. But in the meantime, with most schools on summer holidays, it is up to our sports clubs to engage with the new-found interest in sport. A great deal of expectation is invested in these clubs.\n\nDaley Thompson is right when he says there are going to be a lot of children knocking on doors wanting to take up sport, but are there going to be enough coaches to meet the interest?\n\nAt rowing clubs, there are so many people on waiting lists. Being inspired by what you have seen in London and then ending up on a waiting list is not a great start in anybody\u2019s sporting life. This is where coaching education programmes become significant.\n\nThe change we have witnessed at these Olympics should not be underestimated.\n\nWe have reinvented ourselves from a nation of plucky losers to one of proud winners, and on the back of that we must make sure that the concept of legacy really does mean something.\n\nWhat could make a profound difference is the way our women have performed. We are all aware that there is a substantial drop-off in the number of teenage girls pursuing physical activity when they leave secondary school, and this is where the gold medals for Jessica Ennis and Katherine Grainger, for example, could have a bearing.\n\nTheir achievements can spread an attitude that it is no longer \u2018uncool\u2019 for girls to take up sport.\n\nSo it is up to the Government and UK Sport, and all the potential agents of change, to grasp the momentum. Our female Olympians have enjoyed huge success across all manner of events \u2013 in rowing alone, they outdid the guys by three golds to one.\n\nWhy not, then, create a catch-all programme that involves girls across the whole spectrum of sport?\n\nWe could be reaping the benefits of such a scheme for decades.

Rightly so; the years of rigorous planning, training, and dedication, culminating in some truly outstanding performances should be an inspiration to us all.\n\nThe Team GB athletes have exceeded all expectations and they deserve the accolades of the entire nation, as do the host of Games Makers, whose passion and enthusiasm infected all those they engaged with.I am sure the Paralympic Games will provide a platform for yet more inspirational performances.\n\nBut long after the Games have ended, the permanent venues of the Olympic Park will stand as testament, not only to these sporting achievements, but also to another area where Britain truly leads the world. I\u2019m talking about the creation of civil infrastructure.\n\nAnd here I believe the Park will stand for decades to come as a 'world trade fair\u2019 of British design and construction skills \u2013 our ability to produce unforgettable, unique structures on time and on budget.\n\nThe firm that I lead, Balfour Beatty, brought to life the iconic aquatics centre design of\n\nZaha Hadid. We did it ahead on time and on budget. And more than that, by integrating our design and engineering expertise with our construction skills, we transformed the environmental footprint of the building.\n\nOur innovative approach to planning and sequencing throughout the construction process reduced the use of hardwood and steel without compromising the integrity of the building.\n\nAfter the games are over, the temporary seating structures that form the 'wings\u2019 of the building will be removed and the walls of the core structure will be completed creating an enduring aquatics facility that many thousands are expected to benefit from in the future.\n\nBalfour Beatty will continue to manage and operate the building, as well as the rest of the Park, helping to fulfil the potential of the Olympic legacy.\n\nUsing the same planning processes and assumptions we built innovative bridges that span the river that meanders around the park. These bridges provide access to the Olympic Stadium for the millions of visitors attending the Games.\n\nOf course once the events are over, visitors will continue to enjoy the wonderful parkland that has been created around the sports facilities but in much smaller numbers.\n\nSo our bridges were designed specifically so that they can be easily narrowed to be more in keeping with visitor numbers expected in the post-Olympic era.\n\nThe Olympics have shown Britain at its very best. The Games have been a huge success for our athletes and it is right that the government should make every effort to build on this success and create an enduring legacy in sport. For me, it has also showcased the capabilities of the British construction and engineering industry that collectively delivered these great venues. Working alongside the good management of the Government, our key stakeholder and in partnership with each other, we have delivered some of the most complex designs ever seen in the UK \u2013 this is something our industry, and nation, should be proud of.\n\nThe government should not miss the opportunity to crystallise a positive economic legacy through the development of civil infrastructure projects. Perhaps they should host a trade summit there \u2013 while the memory of the wonderful XXX Olympiad is still fresh in everyone\u2019s minds.\n\nIan Tyler is the chief executive of Balfour Beatty", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02340/pint_2340286g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02064/Sir-James-Dyson_2064492g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03562/FDetox_Shopping_85_3562706g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03575/City_of_London_3575797g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02310/good_news_britain_2310965a.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01837/bunzl-web_1837233g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02306/poetry_009_2306222k.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03554/dudley1_3554550g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03568/Financial_Detox__h_3568618g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02306/poetry_009_2306222b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02306/poetry_009_2306222k.jpg", "date": "16/08/2012"}, "rank_197": {"title": "Keep the flame alive: Olympics inspires nation to volunteer", "text": "Eight times as many adults said they were more likely to help to give their time to local sporting clubs or schools after the successful Games.\n\nThe goodwill follows a wave of national pride at the achievements of Team GB and praise for the smooth organisation of the Olympics.\n\nDavid Cameron has hailed the efforts of the 70,000 \u201cGames Makers\u201d, who volunteered to staff sports venues free, as essential to making the Olympics so successful.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph has launched the Keep the Flame Alive campaign to secure a lasting legacy for the London 2012 Games, with an increase in volunteering at local sports clubs.\n\nA poll of 1,896 adults older than 18, conducted this week by Opinium Research, found that a quarter (24 per cent) were \u201cmore likely\u201d to consider volunteering as a result of the Olympics.\n\nSupport was higher among younger people, with more than a third (35 per cent) of 18-34 year-olds saying they were slightly or much more likely to consider volunteering at sports clubs or schools or assisting other good causes.\n\nOnly three per cent of respondents said they were less likely to help after the Olympics, while those older than 55 were less likely than younger groups to consider giving up more of their time.\n\nSir Stuart Etherington, the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, welcomed the findings.

No traffic, wonderful volunteers, great atmosphere, sensational competition. What\u2019s not to like?\n\nBut the trouble with the Olympics is that they have raised expectations, expectations which rugby has to meet if Vaughan is to deliver his, and his team\u2019s, ambition of \u201cstaging the best Rugby World Cup ever\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe scale of the Olympics is so much bigger,\u201d Vaughan explains. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete with that. The Olympics involved 36 separate sports played out in multiple venues, but focusing mainly on the Olympic Park. We are a single sport running across 10 to 12 venues over 6\u00bd weeks. The look and feel of our competition will be quite different.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is the passion of one sport and we have to market that. The Rugby World Cup is the world\u2019s third largest event if you look at it in terms of viewership and attendance.\n\n\u201cThe Olympics had 10,500 athletes, the Paralympics has 4,000. We have 20 teams, so there is a big switch of emphasis.\u201d\n\nThat is the tricky bit right there. How to make the experience memorably unique. In 2011 New Zealand tugged the heart strings and sold the World Cup as a stadium of four million awash, engulfed, engorged by rugby. For the best part of seven weeks New Zealand offered total immersion. Turn on a mid-morning television cookery show and it was Rugby World Cup themed.\n\nEngland cannot do that. The tournament will be up against football\u2019s Premier League and it will take place in a context which is far more diverse and diffuse.\n\nVaughan\u2019s strategy is to go big and to tap into the life experiences which he believes rugby offers. \u201cWe will have a capacity of 2.9 million tickets, which we expect to sell out,\u201d he says. \u201cNew Zealand sold 1.4 million tickets, so we will effectively be double their size. That gives us the ability to maintain reasonable ticket prices.\n\n\u201c We believe in some of the pool games we will deliver ticket prices starting below \u00a310. Our size also allows us to expose more people to the game and allow more fans to get to games.\u201d\n\nAnd life experiences? \u201cWe\u2019re very aware that rugby is more than 80 minutes. It\u2019s a whole day out, or, if people are coming in from abroad, a sort of tour. It\u2019s all about community. You make friends. Win or lose, you can still have a beer. For us, it\u2019s about being inclusive, about celebration, about how we inspire people. Most importantly, though, it\u2019s about a sport about which a huge number of people are passionate.\u201d\n\nAnd it is not all just about the delivery. An \u2018appropriate\u2019 legacy is the current justification for the millions pumped into major sporting events, and the Rugby World Cup will be no different. \u201cA lot of the Olympic legacy is in infrastructure and buildings, the regeneration of a chunk of east London, and how the sports themselves manage growth from the event,\u201d Vaughan says.\n\n\u201cOur legacy will be primarily about human and intellectual capital. We\u2019re trying to drive more people into the game on the back of the World Cup either to play, referee, coach, volunteer or spectate. We\u2019re also going to invite representatives of the less well developed rugby nations to come to the tournament and place them with Premiership clubs.\n\n\u201cWe hope they will benefit from seeing how rugby is administered here. Spain and Portugal have about 20,000 players each, but they do need assistance in terms of their administration.\u201d\n\nA few years back, during the bitter civil war which ransacked the English rugby scene, the thought of anyone learning anything worthwhile about running the sport was laughable, but there is less rancour around now. If there is a touch of colonialism about the strategy, big blazer helping the little blazers to be more efficient and effective, then at least it is well-intentioned and deliverable.\n\nOne thing, though, which will not be happening is an opening ceremony of Olympian scale. Rugby World Cups have always disappointed in that regard.\n\nIn Cardiff in 1999 the tournament was framed by a parade of so-called home-grown greats, many of whom went unrecognised in Penarth a few miles down the road let alone the major rugby cities of the world.\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s was some wishy-washy Maori affair which looked fine on television but was impenetrable from the stadium itself. And the RFU? Their track record is not great either. It is normally a toss up between the military abseiling from the Twickenham roof or a regimental goat leading a marching band. My favourite is the goat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on that,\u201d Vaughan acknowledges. \u201cThe Olympics has a budget of \u00a327 million for the curtain raiser which was a ticketed event in its own right. They then spent a week turning the venue back into an athletics stadium. We\u2019ve got a match on the same day in the same stadium, so we are thinking about doing it differently.\u201d\n\nGood luck to him with that, and good luck on following an experience as sumptuous, as intimate and as compelling as the Olympics. If Rugby World Cup 2015 is just half as good, then we are in for a treat.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Brian_Moore_2417458j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02313/oly_2313840b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Steve_James_2417426j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02854/mick-cleary_2854025j.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Gavin_Mairs_2417439j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01782/PaulAckford_60_1782372j.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02313/oly_2313840a.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03096/daniel_schofield_6_3096975j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02348/austin-healey_2348213j.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02313/oly_2313840a.jpg", "date": "18/08/2012"}, "rank_50": {"title": "Parents need to get involved to ensure Olympic legacy, athletics clubs say", "text": "Athletics clubs have been \u201cinundated\u201d with enquiries from young people wanting to take up sport since Team GB came third in the Olympics medal table.

The Opening and Closing Ceremonies drew the biggest audiences, closely followed by Usain Bolt\u2019s victory in the 100m final.\n\nHowever, lower profile events also attracted substantial audiences.\n\nMore than 24m people watched the Games using the BBC\u2019s red button service, which enabled viewers to choose from 24 events not being shown on the main channels, by pressing a button on their remote controls. Less well-known sports such as judo and gymnastics were often annexed in this way.\n\nSeparately, Channel 4 said demand for its advertising slots during the Paralympic Games was ahead of expectations and that those around the Paralympic Opening Ceremony were \u201csold out\u201d.\n\nThe broadcaster, which paid around \u00a35m for the exclusive rights to air the games, saw revenues for its flagship channel fall by \u00a319.5m to \u00a3622.1m last year as its share of the advertising market shrank. Overall revenues for thegroup rose from \u00a3935.2m to \u00a3941.4m.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02006/danger_2006632g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02990/tax_2990412g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02473/clinic0_2473599g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03010/Reading_3010581g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02303/summary_2303642b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02303/summary_2303642a.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03526/14_12-lang-cat-pou_3526132g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02303/summary_2303642a.jpg", "date": "20/08/2012"}, "rank_96": {"title": "Olympics' closing ceremony, tuition fees and inspiring our youth", "text": "SIR \u2013 Two weeks of aspiration, inspiration and acclamation, then who do we get? George Michael, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand.\n\nSIR \u2013 After the first hour, I lost the will to live and would even have welcomed good old Cliff Richard driving a London bus with Vera Lynn as a clippie. There was virtually no traditional music that represented England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.\n\nSIR \u2013 I enjoyed the closing ceremony, but when trying to show off the best of British why do we put centre stage people known to have taken drugs?\n\nWhat message are we sending out to the generation we are trying to inspire?\n\nYvonne Findlay, London SW5\n\nSIR \u2013 If Russell Brand is the walrus, I\u2019m a gnu.\n\nSimon Baumgartner, Hampton, Middlesex\n\nSIR \u2013 Thank goodness for Eric Idle, is all I have to say.\n\nAlison Gibson, Holdingham, Lincolnshire\n\nOlympic legacy\n\nSIR \u2013 There are millions of Brits around the world who would have appreciated access to the reported UK-biased presentation of the Olympic Games.\n\nThe coverage by the BBC World News TV service was less adequate than it could have been.\n\nTo partially rectify the situation, could the BBC produce a summation from all the footage that was churned out for the home front? A series of hourly programmes over the next few weeks would be ideal, but even just a couple of one-hour shows would be very welcome.\n\nBrian Hughes, Vancouver, Canada\n\nSIR \u2013 Arrangements should be made by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, after the Paralympics, for the millions of Britons who could not afford to buy tickets for the Olympics but who would be thrilled to see inside the main London venues.\n\nPeople visiting the venues would help to \u201cKeep the Flame Alive\u201d. Such a project needs to be put into action to capitalise on the excitement engendered by the Games.\n\nRon Kirby, Dorchester\n\nSIR \u2013 Does anyone else find it strange that, in these days of integration and equality, the Olympics and Paralympics are still two completely separate entities?\n\nIt seems to me to be degrading for the thousands of competitors in the Paralympics that all the talk is about the Olympics being over. Their time is about to start. Could there be complete integration within our lifetime?\n\nClaire Walker, Leeds, West Yorkshire\n\nSIR \u2013 The very successful London Olympic Games has drawn renewed attention to the immense expenditure of hosting these events.\n\nAlthough a case can be made for getting all the world\u2019s greatest athletes together on one occasion, this is becoming increasingly impractical for most cities or even countries. Given the state of the world economy and national indebtedness, there is increased risk of financial disaster for the host country.\n\nAlready the Olympics are divided into summer and winter sports. I suggest the games be divided into four annual events, held over a four-year cycle. The winter games would remain as it is. The summer games would be divided into three, loosely labelled water games, indoor games and outdoor games.\n\nReducing the scope of each Games would, by reducing the costs, enable smaller countries to host them, and provide a major sporting event on an annual basis.\n\nDavid K.C. Cooper, Pittsburgh, US\n\nSIR \u2013 What can we do to reward Lord Coe for his sterling work on the London Olympics? He is a Lord, so we have already ennobled him.\n\nI suggest that he would make an excellent Mayor of London, and that would free Boris to go to the Commons.\n\nLeon Rose, Stockport\n\nBoundaries battle\n\nSIR \u2013 The Liberal Democrats are being naive and short-sighted in threatening to oppose the recommendations of the Boundary Commission because of their failure to secure House of Lords reform (report, Issue 1,099).\n\nLabour looked likely to achieve a comfortable majority at the next election. However, with the proposed boundary changes, there would be a chance Labour could not win enough seats and will need to work in coalition. It is perhaps appropriate that the Lib Dems\u2019 childish behaviour may condemn them to a generation or more of irrelevance on the back benches.\n\nPaul Homewood, Stocksbridge, South Yorkshire\n\nRespect our home\n\nSIR \u2013 The two articles of your new guest columnist Karen Wheeler that I have read are bizarre to the point of absurdity.\n\nFirstly, she was incredibly rude about the food available in restaurants in the Poitou-Charentes (Expat Life, Issue 1,095). I have to report that I have found wonderful places to eat here, where fresh, local produce is used daily for an imaginative range of menus.\n\nSecondly, one of the reasons why Poitou-Charentes is so attractive is that the crime rate is very low \u2013 a statistic she omitted to point out in her second article on being fined by the local gendarmes (Issue 1,098). She complained that she had been fined for a piffling offence, but she did break the law. The requirement to stop at a solid white line is well known in France \u2013 you ignore it at your peril.\n\nThe overall question is \u2013 why did Ms Wheeler move to France if all she can do is find fault with it? We British who love our new home find her disrespectful comments do not help our relationship with our French neighbours.\n\nMichael George, Ruffec, France\n\nThe lure of the large\n\nSIR \u2013 Nick Collins reports that anxious men prefer larger ladies (Issue 1,099).\n\nThat\u2019s the best reason so far for sticking to the diet.\n\nPaula Spurrier, Eversley Cross, Hampshire\n\nInspiring our youth\n\nSIR \u2013 David Cameron says that competitive team sports will be made compulsory for all primary school children in England (report, Issue 1,099).\n\nI suggest a new sport for the Olympic Games: knee-jerk reaction. This sport has the advantage that it does not require the use of playing fields. This fits in well with the policies of successive governments, which have sold hundreds of playing fields.\n\nDavid Laycock, Malvern, Worcestershire\n\nSIR \u2013 It is not only budding athletes who should be inspired by the Games. All those people who came together to plan, build and prepare the Olympic Park can inspire the nation\u2019s youth to become architects, electricians, plumbers and carpenters.\n\nThese careers can hold great job satisfaction. If this could be communicated, maybe with the use of an inspirational film of the development of the park that could be shown in schools, then it could convince children that such work can be rewarding.\n\nPam Raymond, Ringwood, Hampshire\n\nTuition fees\u2019 impact\n\nSIR \u2013 Almost one in 20 students are put off applying to university by rising tuition fees, according to a report (Issue 1,099).\n\nI suggest that the acid test is not the number applying but the number who graduate. Those who enjoyed university education at the taxpayers\u2019 expense had a higher drop-out rate than those who would have wasted their parents\u2019 money by skipping lectures.\n\nI suspect that those who pay for the privilege will continue to be more likely to stay the course and the graduate output will be practically unchanged.\n\nBrian Tordoff, Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire\n\nThese letters were originally published in The Telegraph Weekly World Edition\n\nEmail your letters to weeklyt@telegraph.co.uk", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01757/world-editon-puff_1757536g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02308/lowering_2308500c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01758/expat_directory_30_1758676a.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02369/landgirlssummary_2369751g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01762/jointheexpatcommun_1762987g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01938/redcar2_1938682g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01460/expat_logo_tilt_60_1460198h.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01757/expat-directory-pu_1757478g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02308/lowering_2308500k.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02497/Kosciusko-Morizet_2497372g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02308/lowering_2308500k.jpg", "date": "27/08/2012"}, "rank_70": {"title": "Keep The Flame Alive: Mo Farah backs new \u00a3240,000 athletics track", "text": "The champion long-distance runner, who won both the 5,000m and 10,000m at London 2012 , spoke out in support of the project to help secure an Olympic legacy for the capital on Paddington Recreation Grounds.\n\nWestminster City Council has secured \u00a3130,000 in funding from the Marathon Trust and an additional \u00a344,000 from the London Mayor's Legacy Fund to help pay for the work.\n\nThe improved track will meet International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) standards and will also be able to support long jump, high jump, triple jump and shot put training.\n\nSpeaking after the birth of twins, Mo Farah, who lives in London, said: \u201cCentral London getting a new running track is great news for athletes of the future.\n\n\u201cThe London Olympic Games will inspire a whole new generation of potential sports men and women and it is good to see Westminster City Council leading the way in bringing important new facilities to the heart of the capital.\u201d\n\nThe running track is on the grounds of a former cinder cycle track, which was built in 1888.

even some of the most athletic pupils north of the Border were \u201cvery poor\u201d compared to the international norm.\n\nAmong the reasons highlighted by the organisation were substandard facilities, poor provision of physical activity in the school curriculum and even PE teachers who are physically incapable of teaching sport.\n\nHowever, Scottish Rugby also criticised the BBC and STV for broadcasting too little of its sport, saying this was harming both participation levels and match attendance.\n\nThe warning about the paucity of facilities, made in a submission to a Holyrood inquiry, was echoed by the ruling bodies of other sports including cricket and canoeing.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph has launched a campaign called Keep the Flame Alive to help secure an Olympics legacy of competitive school sport.\n\nIt has won the backing of the Scottish Government but the rugby chiefs concluded there must be \u201csustained investment\u201d in the game if children are to benefit long-term from London 2012 and the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nThey called for \u201curgent action\u201d from ministers, councils, sports quangos and the teaching profession to ensure all pupils have access to high-quality competitive sport.\n\nIn a written submission to the inquiry ahead of appearing before MSPs next week, Scottish Rugby praised the SNP administration\u2019s Cashback for Communities scheme, which sees money seized from criminals distributed among good causes.\n\nThe organisation decided to spend \u00a3250,000 of its proceeds on a scheme to improve school rugby and described to MSPs the disturbing results of tests conducted on S1 and S2 pupils.\n\nUsing an American system called Functional Movement Screening, they were asked to perform seven basic movements required for them to lead a healthy lifestyle, including a deep squat or a push-up.\n\n\u201cDuring our pilot projects we found that pupils\u2019 fitness levels and physical competencies were so poor coming into secondary school, that we had to set our targets at a realistic level,\u201d the submission to Holyrood\u2019s health and sport committee states.\n\nColin Thomson, Scottish Rugby\u2019s director of rugby operations, said: \u201cBearing in mind the kids concerned were at the better end (of the fitness spectrum) \u2013 they\u2019ve offered to do extra rugby \u2013 but the reality is they were not good enough.\u201d\n\nListing the problems in the schools system, the body said it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to increase participation when sports provision often relies on PE staff on short-term contracts.\n\nHowever, some PE teachers lack \u201ceither the physical competence to teach sports\u201d or \u201cthe skills, experience or qualifications to confidently teach technical elements\u201d.\n\nThis is compounded by there being insufficient sport in the curriculum thanks to the number of opt-outs. The result is: \u201cPupils possessing very poor levels of physical fitness, physical competence or generic sporting skills / experience.\u201d\n\nArguing for more all-weather pitches, the submission states: \u201cScotland needs to develop world-class facilities as part of the Olympic legacy. Too often our enthusiastic local clubs have to endure completely inadequate facilities.\u201d\n\nBut Scottish Rugby also said it was also \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the amount of rugby on terrestrial television, saying that other parts of the UK, particularly Wales, has much higher coverage.\n\nIn their submissions, Cricket Scotland and the Scottish Canoe Association also argued that facilities must be improved and called for a \u201ccomprehensive programme\u201d to open up access to facilities at schools, colleges and universities.\n\nBut Shona Robison, the Sports Minister, told the committee the SNP has spent \u00a333 million on sports facilities since coming to power in 2007 and plans to roll out 150 \u201ccommunity sports hubs\u201d across the country by 2016.\n\nIn addition, she said Sportscotland, the sports quango, is reviewing access to existing facilities to see how this can be improved.\n\nA BBC Scotland spokesman said the corporation broadcasts a wide range of rugby including the Six Nations, Melrose Sevens and the forthcoming autumn international test matches.\n\nBut he added: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we balance these competing interests against a finite sports rights budget.\u201d\n\nAn STV spokesman said: \"STV is a strong supporter of rugby and provides regular coverage on air, online and as part of our sports news.\"", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03000/Fotolia_Coding_Man_3000733g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02282/vet_getty_2282871g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03075/rsz_fotolia_projec_3075216g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02129/max-evans_2129222a.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02297/eton_2297105g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02296/pendleton-seatedsm_2296627g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03199/15174814041_17ed2f_3199087g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/keep-the-flame-alive/9529482/ https:/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03186/IAB_Student_Life_4_3186316a.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02871/simon_johnson-1_2871058j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02243/Aviva_school_crick_2243063g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03214/CF-140x87_3214162g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01673/consultant_1673824g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03068/Postgrad_piggy_ban_3068937g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02129/max-evans_2129222c.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02129/max-evans_2129222a.jpg", "date": "08/09/2012"}, "rank_135": {"title": "Olympic and Paralympic Athletes' Parade: where to go", "text": "Britain's sporting heroes will be saluted as a huge precession snakes its way through the streets of London in front of tens of thousands of adoring fans.\n\nOlympic and Paralympic heroes will be celebrated at the end of a sparkling summer of British sport as London streets are brought to a standstill for The Greatest Team Parade.\n\nAthletes will travel on 21 open-top floats, grouped in alphabetical order by their sport.

He said: \"Over her career, Tessa has been an amazing asset to the Labour Party and to Britain. Her legacy is enormous.\n\n\"What we have seen at the London 2012 would not have been possible without Tessa\u2019s determination and dedication both in championing the bid and playing a major role in delivering the Games. For this the whole country owes her a huge debt of gratitude.\"\n\nThe 64-year-old mother-of-two, who was first elected to the Commons 20-years-ago, was a loyal supporter of Mr Blair, and it was in her role as his secretary of state for culture, media and sport that she first approached him with the proposal that London bid for the Games.\n\nAt the time, none of her Cabinet colleagues or civil servants in the department were in favour of the bid. But three years later, she was beside Mr Blair in Singapore as the Olympics were awarded to London.\n\nAnd she continued to work on delivering the Games, both in government and opposition, until the last day of the Paralympics on Sunday.\n\nMrs Jowell, who separated from her husband, David Mills, in 2006 after he became embroiled in a financial scandal involving Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, is chairman of the City Safe Foundation, which works to create safe havens in buildings across London for youngsters at risk of gang crime.\n\nShe did not disclose whether she would remain in Parliament after the next general election, or rule out a return to front-line politics in the future.\n\n\u201cMost of all I want to give time to my constituency,\u201d she said.\n\nSeveral of Mrs Jowell's colleagues paid tribute to her on Twitter.\n\nDouglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"There was a warm thank you from the whole shadow cabinet this morning for @jowellt She's a great colleague and was an outstanding minister.\"\n\nChuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary added: \"v.emotional shadow cabinet - the last with our @jowellt, who's made a huge contribution to our party and country ... and will continue to do so!\"\n\nAnd Clive Efford, Labour MP for Eltham, said: \"Those of us who feel pride over Olympics can thank Tessa Jowell she had the vision to see of what Britain could achieve. Thank you Tessa!\"\n\nHugh Robertson, the Conservative Sports minister, also sent his good wishes to Mrs Jowell. He said: \"I'd like to pay tribute to Tessa's excellent work on the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n\"Not only did she play a vital role in the winning bid team but she laid the foundations for a successful Games, which was recognised in this year's Queen's Birthday Honours.\n\n\"I was pleased that, with the cross-party approach to the Games, Tessa continued to be involved throughout, with a position on the Olympic Board and as deputy mayor of the Athletes' Village during the Olympic Games. She took on both roles with her usual enthusiasm and expertise.\"\n\nMrs Jowell took to Twitter to express her gratitude for the tributes. She said: \"Thank you for all your good wishes.

It had been assumed that Coe would gain entry to the IOC through his possible appointment as the next president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, but this represents a less treacherous route.\n\nCoe may also find he will be considered for the role of World Anti-Doping Agency president, given his strong anti-drugs stance throughout his stellar athletics career. The next Wada presidency is due to be filled by an IOC-nominated person when the current president, the government-nominated former NSW state premier John Fahey, steps down.\n\nNotwithstanding Coe\u2019s international forays, he will also have to address five key domestic challenges upon assuming his four-year BOA post on Wednesday, the most pressing of which is the organisation\u2019s parlous finances.\n\nWhile the BOA had been hamstrung in its marketing activities because of a previous deal with the London Olympic organisers, it still managed to raise \u00a388 million over the past eight years to cover the cost of sending teams to Beijing and London.\n\nWhen Locog contributes a further \u00a35 million from any Games profit, the BOA will technically be in the black, but continuing to raise the \u00a310 million a year required to keep it in the black in the tough economic climate will be a priority.\n\nAnother priority will be the BOA\u2019s relationships with government and ensuring athletes benefit from a sports legacy. Certainly Coe\u2019s close relationships with Sir Keith Mills and sports minister Hugh Robertson will play a huge role in developing this front.", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01805/Jacquelin_Magnay_6_1805943j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02390/coe_2390557a.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02390/coe_2390557b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02390/coe_2390557a.jpg", "date": "06/11/2012"}, "rank_53": {"title": "Olympic Stadium reopening delayed until 2016 after modifications are required by potential bidders", "text": "The London Legacy Development Corporation is still deciding whether to accept any of the four bidders \u2014 West Ham, Leyton Orient, Formula One and the UCFB College of Football Business \u2014 seeking a 99-year lease on the \u00a3500 million stadium, some of which requires substantial modifications, including providing a roof to cover all of the seating, and possible retractable seating. West Ham\u2019s requirements for new seating and a roof has been roughly estimated at costing \u00a3200 million.\n\nDennis Hone, the LLDC chief executive, told the London Assembly that there have been no formal bids from an NFL American football franchise, although the London Mayor, Boris Johnson, and others had held \u201cencouraging\u201d talks about stadium management with NFL executives during a recent trip to the capital.\n\nAlthough football was still among the front-runners to take up tenancy of the venue, Hone insisted a 2014 reopening was out of the question.\n\nHone said: \u201cThe four bidders have put some requirement on the LLDC as the landlord \u2014 seating, roof, hospitality \u2013 they change from bid to bid.\u201d\n\nHone said if none of the current bidders were accepted, with a decision expected in the first half of next year, the promise to the International Association of Athletics Federations for covered seating during the hosting of the 2017 World Athletics Championships may have to be renegotiated.\n\nHe said it was unlikely the corporation would pay for covered seating without the changes being required by a long-term tenant. If no changes were required the stadium could be open to athletics in 2014, when the northern area of Olympic Park featuring the VeloPark cycling centre is expected to open to the public.\n\nHone explained that the modifications, if a long-term tenant was appointed, may be lengthy because of the need for detailed design, construction and reconfiguration and may push back occupancy of the stadium to August 2015 at the earliest, or even August 2016.\n\nBut Hone defended the protracted process in deciding on a tenant, which has dragged on for years amid legal challenges and uncertainty. \u201cIf it takes a couple of extra months to get the right decision for the public purse I will take it, because I don\u2019t want to make a decision that we will regret in three or four years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe corporation is looking to sell five outstanding large tracts of land on the Olympic Park for future housing developments providing around 8000 residences: a mixture of social housing, family housing and flats.\n\nHone said it was a reasonable estimate to expect \u00a31.1 billion from this housing development, but that the time frame, originally anticipated to be until 2030, may be fast-tracked because of strong demand for housing in the capital.", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript",

funding cuts", "text": "Leading educationalists involved in the delivery of school sports have called for urgent measures following the removal of funding for school sport partnerships.\n\nAt least two prominent sports educators argue that the Olympic and Paralympic legacy is in danger of being lost due to a lack of opportunity to participate in sports beyond what schools can provide.\n\nOne of them, Darren Padgett, runs Team Activ, a not-for-profit company delivering sport in schools and communities.\n\nPadgett has been shortlisted for an Unsung Hero honour at the Aviva/Daily Telegraph School Sport Matters Awards.\n\nHe led a secondary school PE department for nearly 20 years before managing the School Sports Partnership programme in Barnsley for almost 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing less of are proposed solutions to our nation\u2019s questionable track record in developing sport in schools,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cVarious ill-thought-out government interventions over the past 30 years or so have often pushed sport to the periphery of our education system.\n\n\"Having seen what had already been achieved I decided to give up the relative security of employment in the state education sector and set up a non-for-profit organisation aimed at delivering exactly what school sport partnerships had done.\u201d\n\nThe issues for Padgett are clear: while investment in new schools is welcomed, it does seem to be causing some unforeseen problems around sport.\n\nThe need to make money from new sports facilities is at the expense of sports for children outside school hours, he has noticed. Schools would often allow sports providers to offer sports activities using their facilities for free.\n\nThey are now charging to rent pitches and equipment, which limits participation to children who can afford to pay.\n\nMoreover, staggered starts and finishes at some of the new schools are creating issues around post-school hours sports activities: arranging inter-school tournaments is increasingly difficult.\n\nSporting facilities such as tennis courts that were once open for general use are now locked up and have to be rented. This means availability is much more limited and community use is reduced.\n\nPadgett believes that \u201ca society-wide change\u201d is needed. By charging local communities and businesses for sporting events, Team Activ will raise \u00a3250,000 for local schools by 2017.\n\nSimilar issues have recently been raised by Alan Watkinson, a former PE teacher (and winner of the Sports Teacher of the Year award) who helped develop Olympic champion Mo Farah\u2019s interest in running.\n\nWatkinson runs a School Sports Partnership based at Isleworth and Syon School in west London.\n\nWatkinson says he is \u201cvery angry\u201d about Education Secretary Michael Gove\u2019s \u201coffensive\u201d summary dismissal of the outstanding work of the network of School Sport Partnerships.\n\nWatkinson outlined his thoughts recently at a school sports conference organised by the Youth Sport Trust. The former PE teacher has since moved on, but the Games\u2019 promise of being able to inspire a generation remains at the forefront of many educational minds.\n\nThere are proposals \u2013 a cross-party, cross-department plan is needed \u2013 but Watkinson\u2019s first concern is this: \u201cThe number one priority should be movers and shakers round a table with Lord Coe in charge \u2013 now, where have we seen that before?\u201d\n\nAs for funding, he urges ring-fenced levels. \u201cWe need immediate ring fencing and retention of the current level of funding to keep the life support switched on.\n\n\u201cThe further diminishing of our already beleaguered system would be catastrophic. This is still an 80 per cent cut on what went before and greater resource will be needed.\u201d\n\nWatkinson also espouses high-quality primary school physical education, believing it should be the \u201ctop priority\u201d.\n\nIt has long been an issue which School Sport Matters has recognised and identified. The bottom line is that there is still no solution for the delivery of PE and sport in primary school. \u201cWe need to accept that despite pockets of outstanding practice, the problems are so deep rooted that there is no quick fix,\u201d reckons Watkinson.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion is that rigorous Ofsted criteria take the physical development of young people and\n\nall the well-researched, unarguable benefits more seriously.\u201d\n\nUnless those at the coal face are listened to, the legacy from London 2012 could end up fading fast.\n\nAviva and The Daily Telegraph, recognising tomorrow\u2019s champions today.

It highlighted the beginning of London moving from an Olympic City to a Legacy City as well as hosting the inaugural annual platform for Mayor Boris Johnson to announce his economic policy for the year ahead.\n\nI spoke at the dinner - a true career highlight. Monies raised were directed to the Legacy List - a charity founded by The Mayor and The London Legacy Development Corporation - of which Sarah Weir OBE is CEO.\n\nSarah's path to her current role has been colourful. She told me how she \"slid into school at the usual age, slid out again at 16 the minute I could - uninspired, pretty much unnoticed, certainly uneducated\".\n\nShe worked in a hairdressers on Saturdays, which she hated, then a boys' prep school darning socks and reading bedtime stories. The jobs enabled her to buy her first car and then a cheap airline ticket to the US where she spent a year doing everything from teaching Scottish dancing in Baltimore to selling orange juice to tourists in Florida.\n\nAfter nannying, she fell into the City as a gopher in a Lloyd's insurance broking firm: Opening the post, making tea, cleaning the coffee machine and running errands. She made her way up, broking deals in the Lloyd's market. After 15 years she became their first female MD.\n\nHaving got there, she realised it wasn't what she wanted to do, however. Seeking advice, it became clear that she was strongly arts rather than the City oriented. She applied to Birkbeck University and started a part-time course in History of Art. She was MD by day - university student by night. It was hard work, she says, but recalls collecting her BA after a 'four year slog' as one of her proudest moments.\n\nShe left the City - taking a 90pc reduction in salary, giving up the company car, discovering public transport and working part-time in a contemporary art gallery - one of her personal passions. And so began a career in a variety of roles starting as deputy chief executive of Arts & Business, fundraising director at The Royal Academy, director at The Almeida Theatre and then Arts Council England.\n\nShe left ACE at the end of 2007 - taking roles at LOCOG (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games), the ODA (Olympic Delivery Authority) and the London Legacy Development Corporation before becoming chief executive of the Legacy List in 2011.\n\nSet up as a 'force for good' to support the long-term social, cultural and physical regeneration of the East End, it is using London 2012 as its launch pad to support a range of arts and education projects making creative connections between people and the Olympic Park.\n\nIt's been going for one year, has leveraged \u00a31.5m of investment from private and public sources and has got a series of three year creative projects off the ground around the park.\n\nThey employ two young women who live close to the Park in east London with CVs which do not immediately look great on paper. Sarah says they are \"the sort of CV I had at their age. A few O levels and no experience\". Someone took an initial chance on her so she has spent most of her working life taking chances on others when she could.\n\nLooking back, she feels that spending so much time being unsure what she wanted to do and trying out different things in both the private, public and charity sectors turned out to be useful. She learnt to be flexible and adaptable - and adept at speaking all the different 'languages' of these varied arenas.\n\nSome chances were offered to her, some she sought out and others she created by \"wriggling my way through into gaps no-one had noticed had existed\".\n\nShe describes the path she took as \"stimulating, nerve-wracking but never dull\".

It flowed through rowing, it flowed through sailing. We had an inbuilt advantage anyway as we could afford to do those sports. But you knew that if you were technologically ahead of everyone else, it could make half a second difference.\n\n\u201cThey talk about aggregation of marginal gains. I personally don\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s actually technological doping, but none the less it works and we\u2019ve won a vast number of medals as a result of it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that in track and field athletics. You can\u2019t do it in a team sport where the bounce of a ball can make the difference between success and failure.\u201d\n\nDe Vos\u2019s remarks came in an hour-long lecture on elite performance, motivation, and leadership in the wake of London 2012.\n\nOn Friday night, he said his comments were in response to a question from the audience and that he was not criticising other Olympic sports but merely pointing out the difference with athletics.\n\n\u201cI made the point, and perhaps it was an ill-chosen phrase, that one of the reasons we do well in certain sports is perhaps because we have the financial wherewithal to achieve a level that others can\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThere are some sports where certain well-applied financial modals can bring you a certain advantage. My point was that it doesn\u2019t apply in athletics. It\u2019s very, very hard to achieve that.\u201d\n\nDuring the lecture, De Vos also turned his ire on the Education Secretary, Michael Gove, describing his policies on school sport as \u201cstupid\u201d.\n\nCriticising the Government for its failure to deliver an effective Olympic legacy in terms of school sport provision, De Vos said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the place for political grandstanding but Michael Gove\u2019s decision of two years ago to effectively take it off the curriculum for infants schools and make it an optional curriculum for junior schools seems to me the single-minded most stupid piece of dogma that has imposed upon anybody for a very, very long time.\n\n\u201cI think they probably realise that by now and are finding it quite hard to back-rack from that position in the glory of the Games.\u201d\n\nDe Vos insisted on Friday night that he stood by his position. \u201cI do think that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s wrong because actually 20 or 30 years down the line, if we haven\u2019t got active sport in schools we will suffer as a sporting nation.\u201d\n\nDe Vos\u2019s lecture concluded with reflections on the performance of Britain\u2019s track and field athletes at the London Olympics and he admitted that the euphoria of the gold rush on \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 had masked deficiencies in the rest of the squad.\n\n\u201cActually we didn\u2019t have a great Games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had quite a bad Games. Things didn\u2019t go the way we wanted it to. We didn\u2019t get as many finalists as we wanted or as many personal bests as we wanted. There were some spectacular under-performances.\n\n\u201cBut actually, you know what, it didn\u2019t mater because we\u2019re so obsessed by the culture of celebrity and gold that 99 per cent of the population would go, \u2018Athletics had an absolutely fantastic Games\u2019.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02415/mf-de-vos0_2415453a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02099/Simon-Hart_3_60_2099286j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02415/mf-de-vos0_2415453b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02415/mf-de-vos0_2415453a.jpg", "date": "01/12/2012"}, "rank_183": {"title": "West Ham top bidder for London's Olympic Stadium", "text": "The Mayor spoke after a meeting of the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) which is coordinating the leasing and development of Olympic venues after the Games.\n\n\"We have got a first-ranked bidder for the stadium.

funding between now and the Olympics in Rio in 2016. Indoor volleyball has also been cut adrift, although the British women\u2019s beach volleyball team will receive support.\n\nUK Sport, the body which awards funding for elite athletes, has pledged a total of \u00a3347 million to Britain\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls between now and the Rio Games. They have set them the challenge of winning even more medals than they managed in London, something no host nation has achieved before.\n\nBut where all sports were given financial backing before this summer\u2019s Olympics, UK Sport has adopted a far more ruthless approach this time around.\n\nSports minister Hugh Robertson admitted on Tuesday that the sports which had had their funding cut off were only supported before London because organisers thought it would help them sell tickets.\n\nRobertson said: \u201cWhen we hosted the Olympics we supported all sports, mainly to drive ticket sales, although it turned out that that wasn\u2019t a huge problem. But going forward it is done on a performance basis and there is not a lot of point of funding a few sports which will not be there in medal contention.\u201d\n\nThe cut in basketball funding was most savage, falling from \u00a38.6million to nothing and promoting a furious reaction from British Basketball\u2019s performance chairman, Roger Moreland.\n\n\u201cWe knew the criteria that UK Sport were applying for Rio, but having been funded to the tune of \u00a38.6million in the lead up to the London Olympics because of the sport\u2019s medal potential for the future, this is a devastating decision and is a waste of that investment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOver the last five years, the GB teams have done the equivalent of going from League Two in football to the Premier League.\n\n\"They have been competing with the very best countries in the world. It doesn\u2019t seem much of a legacy from 2012 to dash the hopes and aspirations of a sport whose heartland is founded in Britain\u2019s inner cities.\u201d\n\nThe decision not to award funding to volleyball, other than the beach version, means there will be no support for sitting volleyball, the Paralympic sport at which 7/7 bombings survivor Martine Wright competed for Britain.\n\nVolleyball England\u2019s chief executive Lisa Wainwright said UK Sport had made a mockery of the concept of an Olympic legacy.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe investment requested from UK Sport was less than \u00a3500,000 per year per squad over the next four years. Everyone will have seen the impact sitting volleyball can have on people with the winner of the BBC\u2019s Helen Rollason Award, Martine Wright. When we speak of legacy remember this day, the flame has well and truly been extinguished.\u201d\n\nIn general, Paralympic sports were winners in Tuesday\u2019s announcement with funding levels increasing by 43 per cent, while 19 Olympic sports were given greater sums in funding than before London.\n\nCycling\u2019s success at the Games reflected in them being awarded the biggest grant but swimming, which with three medals fell short of its London 2012 target, was cut by nearly \u00a34 million.\n\n\u201cThis is not about punishment [of the swimmers],\u201d said UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl, but swimming is now considering whether it will close up to three of its five elite training centres, although a final decision will not be taken until a new performance director is appointed.\n\nThe funding, of which two-thirds come from the National Lottery and the final third from the taxpayer, also gave a major boost to boxing, whose increase of \u00a34.3million was in percentage terms the biggest of any sport. But it came accompanied by a warning that boxing\u2019s governing body in England must iron out disputes with counterparts in Scotland and Wales or risk losing the money.\n\nNicholl said the ambition of winning 66 medals in the Olympics and 121 in the Paralympics in Rio \u2013 exceeding the totals in London \u2013 was an \u201cincredible challenge\u201d but Robertson added: \u201cThere are very few sports where we see a reason for a huge fall off and quite a few sports which can do better.\n\n\"Australia\u2019s funding fell off a cliff and that is the first mistake we haven\u2019t made, we are making sure there is more money available to be the first home country to improve performance at the next Games.\u201d\n\nSome of the sports which did worst out of Tuesday\u2019s announcement were awarded far higher levels on funding by Sport England on Monday. Sport England funds grassroots while UK Sport is solely concerned with top level sport.\n\n\u201cThere has been a real effort to align the two strategies,\u201d Robertson said.\n\nBaroness Sue Campbell, Chair of UK Sport, added: \u201cIt is not about being popular, it is about making tough decisions.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01805/Jacquelin_Magnay_6_1805943j.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02431/Olympic_funding_fo_2431836k.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02431/Olympic_funding_fo_2431836k.jpg", "date": "18/12/2012"}, "rank_200": {"title": "UK Sport increase funding under revamped programme designed to deliver more medals in Rio than at London 2012", "text": "But four Olympic sports have had their funding cut to nothing by UK Sport following their failure to challenge for medals at London 2012.\n\nBasketball, handball, wrestling and table tennis will not receive any funding between now and the Olympics in Rio in 2016.

If Don Valley were to close, Minichiello said they look at other nearby options such as training outdoors in Leeds.\n\nHe added that demolishing the stadium would be highly damaging for the sport after the success of London 2012, with the number of children enrolling for the City of Sheffield Athletics Club having doubled to around 600 since the end of the Games.\n\n\u201cThe saddest thing about this is what it says about Olympic legacy,\u201d said Minichiello. \u201cDon Valley was where it all began for Jessica and demolishing it means kids in Sheffield will not have the opportunity that Jessica has had.\u201d\n\nDon Valley has become so synonymous with Ennis\u2019s achievements that, after her Olympic victory, former Sheffield MP Richard Caborn called for it to be renamed the \u2018Jessica Ennis Stadium\u2019.\n\nA council spokeswoman said: \"These are extraordinarily difficult times and we have said that we will have to look at tough budget options because of the devastating Government cuts to public spending and local government.

From that point, the reaction against \u2018political correctness\u2019 became an almost evangelical crusade. Its infinitely broad span encompassed all sorts of reactionary concerns, from \u2018Stalinist speed bumps\u2019 to the \u2018global warming myth\u2019, from councils banning Christmas to the inalienable right of every Briton to call a bender \u2018a bender\u2019 if he so chooses.\n\nThis process of linguistic hyperextension (it actually has its own word \u2014 \u2018catachresis\u2019 \u2014 mind you use it correctly) is evident in other contexts too. Let us examine the peculiar mutation of one particular term that has been legion in recent months.\n\n\u201cThe saddest thing about this is what it says about Olympic legacy,\u201d says athletics coach Tony Minichiello of the proposal to demolish the Don Valley Athletics Stadium in Sheffield.\n\n\u201cSo much for this Olympic legacy,\u201d shouts the Daily Mail website, reporting that \u201cOlympic organsiers [sic] have come under fire\u201d over the fact that Greenwich Park \u201cremains a muddy quagmire\u201d and \u201cclosed to the public six months after the end of the Games\u201d.\n\nThe Independent , meanwhile, reports that the first property on the site of the Olympic Park will soon be receiving residents. \u201cThe most dedicated and nostalgic Olympic fans will soon be able to purchase their own part of the Olympic legacy,\u201d it writes.\n\nThere are early signs \u2014 and they are but early; like good scotch, good catachresis takes years to perfect \u2014 that the term \u2018Olympic legacy\u2019 is destined to suffer the same fate as \u2018political correctness\u2019: a nobly-conceived phraseology contorted and corrupted to such an extent that it is ultimately drained of all meaning.\n\nIt is interesting to consider what people were expecting Britain\u2019s Olympic legacy to look like. Vast numbers appear to have mistaken it for some sort of halcyon, Danny Boyle-curated Elysium. Lithe, smiling children skip through emerald-encrusted streets, gleefully hurling javelins. Kenneth Branagh leans against a row of red-brick houses, absent-mindedly reciting Shakespeare while the Chariots of Fire music plays on a loop. To whooping crowds, the wildly popular Michael Gove announces the construction of 100,000 new velodromes on existing brownfield sites.\n\nIt is hardly surprising, therefore, that when the reality fails to keep pace with the reverie, it is the legacy rather than the reverie that is blamed. \u201cTube out of service? So much for our Olympic legacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust seen a fat kid eating a packet of crisps. Is that what Lord Coe meant by Olympic legacy?\u201d\n\n\u201cFour consecutive days of rain? What sort of Olympic legacy is that, Lord Coe?\u201d\n\nThe same lines were being trotted out after the launch of ITV1\u2019s new game show Splash!, in which Tom Daley introduces an assortment of D-list celebrities to diving. For a start, the title seems a trifle misplaced, given that splash is a diver\u2019s worst enemy; they may as well call a cycling show EPO! or a show featuring racehorses Shotgun!.\n\nThe programme itself is, at 90 minutes, around 84 minutes too long. Daley grins; Vernon Kay gurns; Gabby Logan, one of the few sources of true compassion in this turbulent world, sympathises. Almost without exception, the celebrities are desperate, washed-up and just a little bit tragic.\n\nAll well and bad. But it seems to me that the very existence of Splash! \u2014 a show about diving on prime time national television \u2014 is a wildly impressive feat in itself. If minority sport really is going to conquer the public consciousness, then gaudy, trashy TV for the masses is going to be one of the only means of doing so. The road to the mainstream may be paved with good intentions, but it will also be littered with detours into the adulterated and the hybridised.\n\nWhat next? Pommel!, a celebrity gymnastics show featuring rising star Louis Smith, is my bet. Keel!, starring Ben Ainslie? Or possibly, given Splash!\u2019s injudicious title, a celebrity boxing show entitled Cut Above The Eye!? Now that, to coin a phrase, would be Olympic legacy gone mad.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02450/tomdaley_2450550b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03082/jonny-liew60_3082382j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02450/tomdaley_2450550a.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02450/tomdaley_2450550a.jpg", "date": "14/01/2013"}, "rank_51": {"title": "Olympic legacy 'in tatters' over school sports failings, Labour claims", "text": "Teachers and parents have expressed dismay that Ministers are squandering the enthusiasm and passion generated by the success of last summer\u2019s Olympics.\n\nA majority of people think that official support for grassroots sport has either stagnated or been cut back since the Coalition came to power in 2010, a new survey found.\n\nJust one in 10 people believe that the Government has increased its backing for sport in schools and communities.\n\nTwo-thirds of parents with children of school age or younger, felt that support had stayed the same or been reduced since 2010, with only 17 per cent saying it had increased, according to the poll for The Observer .\n\nCritics have accused Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, of undermining the importance of school sport by scrapping the requirement for all pupils to have at least two hours of PE a week and dismantling Labour\u2019s school sport partnerships, local networks of organised sport and competition.\n\nStephen Twigg, the shadow education secretary, claimed that the Government had failed to build on the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity created by the 2012 Games to improve children\u2019s fitness.\n\nHe said: \"Six months on, the Olympic legacy is in tatters.

We will continue to support our athletes and hopefully we\u2019ll have more money in the future because we\u2019re setting the club up on a more commercial basis.\u201d\n\nIn its recent Active People Survey, Sport England reported that athletics had enjoyed an increase in participation levels since 2008 and rewarded the sport with an investment of \u00a322 million, a rise of \u00a31.6million, for the next four-year cycle.\n\nBut the headline figure of 2,033,700 people taking part in athletics at least once a week included recreational joggers. Sport England puts the number taking part in track and field at 91,700.\n\nMeanwhile, Ennis has announced she will not compete indoors this year and will instead concentrate on regaining her title at this summer\u2019s World Championships in Moscow.\n\nEnnis, who is due to be married in the spring, is not expected to compete outdoors until a low-key Edinburgh Women\u2019s League meeting on June 8. Her first heptathlon of the year is likely to be the European Cup Combined Events meeting in Tallinn, Estonia, on June 28-29.\n\nBelgrave Harriers on the global stage\n\nPhillips Idowu\n\nFormer world outdoor and indoor triple jump champion and silver medallist at 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nDwain Chambers\n\nFormer world indoor 60m champion who has rebuilt his career as Britain\u2019s No 1 sprinter after serving a drugs ban.\n\nWilliam Sharman\n\n110m hurdler who has finished fourth and fifth respectively at the last two World Championships.\n\nJohn Regis\n\nFormer world indoor 200m champion and the only British athlete under 20 seconds for 200m.\n\nJon Ridgeon\n\nSilver medallist in the 110m hurdles at the 1987 World Championships, beating Colin Jackson.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/91952193_LONDON_EN_3589285g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Steve_James_2417426j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03082/jonny-liew60_3082382j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03187/topp-100-50_3187081g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03189/chris-bascombe_3189184j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/James_Corrigan_2417395j.PNG", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02470/chambers_2470824b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03218/hardmensplit_3218019g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03220/team_3220787g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03584/lpool1_3584875g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/blood_3589220g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Telegraph_football_3588075g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03587/arsenal1_3587463g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02470/chambers_2470824a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03202/Ibraauditions_3202090g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02099/Simon-Hart_3_60_2099286j.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02470/chambers_2470824a.jpg", "date": "04/02/2013"}, "rank_56": {"title": "Usain Bolt gifted a tax-free trip to London for 2012 Games anniversary meeting at Olympic Stadium", "text": "With the exception of the Olympics, Bolt has not raced in Britain since 2009 because the tax rules for foreign sports stars would leave him out of pocket.\n\nBut the Chancellor has agreed to a \u201cone-off exemption\u201d for the meeting that will allow the triple Olympic champion and the rest of the world\u2019s leading overseas athletes to compete tax-free in a reprise of the track and field programme at the London Olympics.\n\nOsborne said: \u201cThe Government is determined to do everything possible to secure the Olympic legacy and I am delighted to grant this exemption.\u201d\n\nThe Chancellor\u2019s decision follows a series of meetings with Lord Coe, the London 2012 chairman and now the Government\u2019s Olympics legacy ambassador, who had lobbied for the tax rules to be waived to allow Bolt to take part.\n\nAlthough stars such as double Olympic champion Mo Farah and heptathlon gold medallist Jessica Ennis had already pledged their support for the event, the presence of the world\u2019s most iconic athlete will add lustre to the anniversary celebrations.\n\nThe meeting, which forms part of the international Diamond League series, was originally due to be staged in its traditional home of Crystal Palace but was switched to the Olympic Stadium last month to mark the first anniversary of the Games on July 27.\n\nIt is understood that the meeting will retain its two-day format, with an evening session on Friday, July 26, and a second session the following day. The two days of competition are now set to be one of the highlights of the athletics summer, possibly even rivalling the World Championships in Moscow in August in terms of spectator interest.\n\nThe huge number of people who have already registered for priority tickets on the UK Athletics website means there are high hopes that both sessions will be an 80,000 sell-out.\n\nBolt has always insisted that he would love to compete in Britain again, particularly because London is his main European base during the summer season, but tax regulations made it impossible because he would be paying out more than he earned.\n\nAlthough he commands a typical appearance fee of $250,000 (\u00a3160,000), tax rules mean he would be paying tax not just on his earnings at the meeting but on a proportion of his entire global income, including his multi-million dollar sponsorship deals.\n\nLast night Bolt\u2019s London-based agent, Ricky Simms, welcomed Osborne\u2019s decision to relax the rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news for the Diamond League meeting and British sport in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rules were discouraging a lot of the top stars from competing in the UK when they had options elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSimms added that Bolt had already signed contracts to compete in various meets around the world this summer and he would now have to talk to the sprinter and his coach, Glen Mills, about adding London to his programme.\n\nSimms said: \u201cI think it\u2019s about two weeks before the World Championships, which is quite late, but it\u2019s London and it\u2019s the Olympic Stadium again so it obviously has an attraction.\u201d\n\nIt is understood that Osborne was persuaded to offer the tax concession because of the significance of the anniversary and the importance of cementing an Olympic legacy. The loss of tax revenue is believed to be negligible compared to the wider benefits to London and athletics.\n\nThe exemption affects only non-resident athletes, and covers any appearance fees, prize money and the slice of sponsorship income that would normally be taxable.\n\nA Treasury source said the Chancellor was keen to play his part in building on the momentum of the Games by re-creating another \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d in the stadium. Privately, there is high praise for the efforts of Coe in arguing for a tax amnesty and banging the drum for athletics.\n\nThe news has been welcomed by UK Athletics, which said in a statement: \u201cWe are delighted with the announcement from the Chancellor, which recognises the unique nature of this summer\u2019s weekend of international athletics in the Olympic Stadium marking the first anniversary of London 2012.\u201d\n\nThe governing body has yet to announce a new sponsorship deal since its contract with Aviva expired at the end of last year but the prospect of two capacity crowds in the Olympic Stadium will be a big selling point for would-be corporate backers.\n\nThe London Grand Prix will be the first sports meeting to be exempted from the tax rules for non-resident athletes at the discretion of the Government.\n\nThe 2011 Champions League final at Wembley and the Olympic Games were both subject to a tax amnesty but that was a contractual obligation agreed with Uefa and the International Olympic Committee. This year\u2019s Champions League final and the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow have similar contractual exemptions.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02473/Bolt1_2473279b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/91952193_LONDON_EN_3589285g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Steve_James_2417426j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03082/jonny-liew60_3082382j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03187/topp-100-50_3187081g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03189/chris-bascombe_3189184j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/James_Corrigan_2417395j.PNG", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03218/hardmensplit_3218019g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03220/team_3220787g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03584/lpool1_3584875g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02473/bolt_2473406a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/blood_3589220g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Telegraph_football_3588075g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03587/arsenal1_3587463g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03202/Ibraauditions_3202090g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02099/Simon-Hart_3_60_2099286j.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02473/bolt_2473406a.jpg", "date": "07/02/2013"}, "rank_45": {"title": "Where did that Olympic legacy go?", "text": "Could Britain\u2019s body image be any more warped? It\u2019s hard to believe that we spent last summer gazing in admiration and envy at our honed, toned Olympians. We watched the lithe, fit, not necessarily able\u2011bodied, athletes run and swim and dive. We were riveted by Bradley Wiggins cycling and Katherine Grainger rowing to victory; here were sportsmen and women of all shapes and sizes; the one thing they had in common was that they were in peak physical condition.\n\nBut instead of striving to emulate them, we snacked in front of the telly and put on a collective 18.9 million stone \u2013 much of it, apparently, in Tamworth, which has led to the town being crowned the chubbiest place in the country.\n\nWhither the inspirational 2012 legacy, now that we have figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) showing that 10 per cent of children are obese by the time they enter primary school? More alarming still, that rises to an appalling 20 per cent by the time they leave, presumably having devoured their SATS (and the classroom furniture).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, we also learnt this week of the death, from anorexia, of \u201cbright and beautiful\u201d Laura Willmott, a privately educated 18-year-old, who used her considerable intelligence to engage in what was described as \u201cbreathtaking\u201d deceit against those who fought so hard to keep her alive.\n\nHer terrible plight makes harrowing reading for any parent, not least because once she passed her milestone birthday, Laura was deemed old enough to make the decisions governing her care.\n\nOld enough maybe, but surely not well enough. It\u2019s hard to reconcile the photograph of a pretty, poised teenager with the medical details that emerged in the coroner\u2019s court \u2013 malnourishment, hair loss, a weight of five stone that left her too weak to walk and reduced her to effortful crawling.\n\nHer mother, Vickie Townsend, a nurse, was deeply unhappy when her daughter was discharged from hospital in Bristol in October 2011 as \u201can experiment\u201d to see if she could cope. She couldn\u2019t. Within weeks she was re\u2011hospitalised and died. Now it is her family who must see if they can cope.\n\nLaura\u2019s case is an extreme example, but figures from the HSCIC reveal that the rate of hospital admissions for treatment of eating disorders increased by 16 per cent over the past year. Most \u2013 91 per cent \u2013 were girls and the majority 55 per cent were aged between 10 and 19.\n\nAnorexia is mental illness rooted in an individual\u2019s irrational belief that they are fat. The obesity epidemic arises from parents en masse overfeeding their children in the irrational belief that they aren\u2019t fat.\n\nThe HSCIC discovered that half of the parents of obese children thought they were \u201cabout the right weight\u201d. Had they watched them puffing, thighs chafing, on school Sports Day or struggling to attempt a game of five aside, they might have been forced to confront the truth and their own culpability.\n\nLondon 2012 was heralded as an Olympics that would bring with it a lasting legacy, most significantly the boosting of sport in schools, to everyone\u2019s gain.\n\nWould that this next generation could share that same body image, where strength rather than skinniness is the sought-after goal for girls and both sexes regard food is a fuel to be burned off running about rather than an emotional prop.\n\nMy 10-year-old recently learnt to surf, a sport that requires little outlay (aside from the entirely necessary wetsuit) and is, when I think about it, the perfect pursuit for an island nation. It\u2019s exhilarating and challenging, demanding as it requires concentration, patience, and resilience, and I dearly hope she persists with it.\n\nMeanwhile, leading educationalists involved in school sports are already flagging up warnings that the 2012 legacy is fading fast following government funding cuts. We mustn\u2019t allow investment to be channelled exclusively towards elite athletes.\n\nWe need a collective will to push through radical reform at school level, or else the only gold medals our children are likely to win will be for sofa-surfing.\n\n-------\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the Oscars are Mis\u00e9rable\n\nI do hope Anne Hathaway wins an Oscar for Les Mis\u00e9rables, even though I haven\u2019t seen it; sorry, too tragic for a night out. I loved her in The Princess Diaries, though.\n\nBut, hey, the Academy Awards are less about the performance in the movie than the appearance in the frock. I once attended the Vanity Fair post-Oscars party, and while it was glitzy, ritzy and undeniably star-studded, there was no order of precedence and no script, so everyone stood around in a weird A-list limbo, not speaking.\n\nThere was Jim Carrey, whose teeth are even more snowblindingly white in real life, and Willem Dafoe, small but perfectly formed, whose \u201cdate\u201d was his agent. By comparison, Amazonian Minnie Driver was vertiginously, comically tall in heels, the late great Tony Curtis winked lasciviously at me as he twirled a Marilyn Monroe-alike round the dance floor, and Madonna (tiny, gnarled, grumpy) reclined in state on a sofa surrounded by fawning acolytes and burly security.\n\nBut, to my great joy, there were so few awestruck civilians to go around that I was in greater demand than a proverbial line of Bolivian Marching Powder.\n\nThe sainted Meryl Streep was close enough to touch. So I did. Well, actually she touched me first.\n\n\u201cMiss Streep, you were robbed of the Oscar, robbed!\u201d was my opening gambit.\n\n\u201cOh dear, sweet child,\u201d she replied, clasping me to her Academy Award-winning bosom and planting a maternal kiss on my cheek, which simultaneously thrilled me (Meryl Streep!) and shamed me (I hadn\u2019t seen her film).\n\nI do hope I don\u2019t have to leap on a plane to ply the lovely Anne with similar platitudes.\n\n-------\n\nNow look here, David \u2026\n\nLook, have you noticed that whenever David Cameron is challenged on air, he immediately wrests back the debate by opening with the marvellously dismissive \u201cL\u201d word?\n\nLook, John Humphrys or Jim Naughtie or Sarah Montague, it\u2019s a really effective rhetorical device. Because it doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s been poleaxed by the deficit target or skewered over the NHS, once he says \u201cLook\u201d in that patronising-yet-oddly-stirring way, nobody remembers the question.\n\nSometimes he says \u201cListen\u201d instead, just to shake things up a bit, and that works too, in a \u201clet\u2019s just draw a line under the whole sorry business and move on\u201d sort of way.\n\nLook, it\u2019s very irritating and manipulative. But, listen, it\u2019s also sheer political genius.\n\n------\n\nHappiness is a gay best friend\n\nI was genuinely shocked by the scientific study revealing that a girl\u2019s best friend is a gay guy. I mean, what in Gok Wan is going on?\n\nDo people actually get research grants to prove the bleedin\u2019 obvious?\n\nI\u2019m regrettably \u201cbetween\u201d gay friends at present, which sounds like a defamatory stereotype \u2013 to anyone but a gay BFF.\n\nAside from telling you that, yes, you do look like a right old porker in that and, no, don\u2019t call your ex (because, girlfriend, needy is a bigger turn-off than a Cher B-side), a true gay soulmate will be too preoccupied giving offence to take it.\n\nFor years I enjoyed a Will & Grace flatshare with a friend who would introduce me as his \u201ctoken hettie\u201d \u2013 heterosexual \u2013 and flirt relentlessly with my boyfriends in a bid to demonstrate that any man can be turned.\n\nI don\u2019t know if he succeeded, but I do know I mist over with nostalgia at the opening chords of I Will Survive.\n\n-------\n\nFood: a modern fairy tale\n\nIt\u2019s long been argued that nursery rhymes and fairy tales are a safe way of exploring our deepest human fears.\n\nHansel and Gretel focuses on abandonment. The Three Little Pigs centres on the importance of adhering to building regulations. Sing a Song of Sixpence, with its four and 20 blackbirds, offers the perfect preparation for \u2013 opening a bag of Tesco salad containing a dead warbler.\n\nEven vegetarians are no longer safe from the adulteration of the food supply chain; no wonder, what with pease pudding hot and pease pudding cold, on sale in major supermarkets nine days old, and spiders in the curds and whey chill cabinet.\n\nI say we dispatch the health and safety biosecurity heavies to Old MacDonald\u2019s Farm immediately, before things become impossibly Grimm.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/grandad_3602577g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02489/Anorexia_2489868k.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02857/Syrian-Refugee-Chi_2857783g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03023/plaque_attack_sum_3023203g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01780/Woods_60_1780859j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/Wombat-1-e_3602888g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02069/baby-620_2069994g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02489/Anorexia_2489868b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03549/scientist-in-lab_3549159g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01738/Kaya_1738475g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02169/matador_2169470g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02489/Anorexia_2489868k.jpg", "date": "22/02/2013"}, "rank_156": {"title": "Don Valley Stadium to be demolished due to cost cuts", "text": "The 25,000-seat stadium, which was built to host the World Student Games in 1991 at a cost of \u00a329 million and is the second largest athletics venue in Britain after the Olympic Stadium, will close in September and is set to be bulldozed to make way for medical research facilities.\n\nSheffield\u2019s Labour-run City Council said it had no choice but to axe the loss-making stadium due to spending cuts imposed on it by the Coalition Government. The venue costs \u00a3700,000 a year to run and the council said it was also facing a \u00a31.6 million repair bill.\n\nBut the decision has saddened Ennis, whose talent for athletics was first spotted on the Don Valley track when she attended a summer camp at the stadium when she was 10 years old. She still trains there at least twice a week.\n\nOn her Twitter page, she wrote yesterday: \u201cSo sad to lose Don Valley Stadium. Where it all started for me. Great memories.\u201d\n\nThe council has made alternative proposals to refurbish the nearby Woodbourn Road stadium \u2013 a much smaller venue which was closed 18 months ago and is now in a state of disrepair.\n\nHowever, Ennis\u2019s long-term coach, Toni Minichiello, has questioned whether enough money will be made available to redevelop the stadium to an acceptable level.\n\n\"The amount of money they want to put in really doesn't bring it up to scratch or provide any lasting legacy for athletics in the city,\u201d he said.\n\nThe decision of the council comes just seven months after it granted Ennis the Freedom of the City at a civic reception in the centre of Sheffield attended by a crowd of more than 20,000. There was also talk of renaming Don Valley the Jessica Ennis Stadium in honour of her achievement in London.\n\nEnnis, who received a CBE at Buckingham Palace on Thursday, said before yesterday\u2019s budget meeting that she hoped the council would make the \u201cright decision\u201d and give the stadium a reprieve.\n\n\"Having that iconic stadium in my home city is incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to lose that would be such a shame for future athletes coming through.\"\n\nSports minister Hugh Robertson had also expressed his hope that the stadium would be saved, describing the venue as \u201cextraordinarily emblematic\u201d.\n\nMinichiello said: \u201cIf there are fewer facilities, things get crowded and when kids turn up to try it for the first time, it\u2019s a bit rubbish so they never come back again. The next gold medallist walks out of the door because we didn\u2019t take the whole legacy thing seriously.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/91952193_LONDON_EN_3589285g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Steve_James_2417426j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03082/jonny-liew60_3082382j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02497/donvalley_2497580b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03187/topp-100-50_3187081g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03189/chris-bascombe_3189184j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02497/donvalley_2497580a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/James_Corrigan_2417395j.PNG", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03218/hardmensplit_3218019g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03220/team_3220787g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03584/lpool1_3584875g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/blood_3589220g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Telegraph_football_3588075g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03587/arsenal1_3587463g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03202/Ibraauditions_3202090g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02099/Simon-Hart_3_60_2099286j.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02497/donvalley_2497580a.jpg", "date": "02/03/2013"}, "rank_74": {"title": "Arts festival at Olympic Park to celebrate one year anniversary of Opening Ceremony", "text": "The celebration, entitled East, will feature live music, theatre, art, dance and food to mark the north part of the park being opened to the public.\n\nThe event, on July 27 and 28, is intended to celebrate the opening of the area to local communities as part of the Olympic legacy.\n\nThe festival, run by the Barbican and Create London, is said to be a \u201ccounterpart\u201d to the expensive ticketed shows held at the Park, using the landscape itself to bring \u201ctheatre, magic and music\u201d.\n\nIt will be followed by the Hard Rock Calling concert, as the park is gradually opened up to the public again.\n\nThe event, announced yesterday by the Barbican, is part of the 2013 \u2013 2014 season of works including an exhibition showcasing the work of designer Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019, the return of the Royal Shakespeare Company and a host of works to make it a \u201cmuseum without walls\u201d.\n\nThe venue also confirmed visitor numbers had risen 14 per cent in the last year; the equivalent of 100,000 extra people.\n\nSir Nicholas Kenyon, managing director of the Barbican, said he was \"thrilled\" to have been commissioned to present East, as a result of their long-running relationship with that part of London.\n\nHadrian Garrard, director of Create London, said that the weekend would be \"a counterpart to the big flashy, flag-waving expensive ticket offers that we've seen previously\".\n\nHe added: \"All the programming we're doing is focused around getting people to explore the space in a different way.

Confirmation is expected imminently, possibly by the end of this week, with Cameron in line to lead the announcement.\n\nThe departments of health, education and culture are all expected to commit funding, with ministers keen to ensure the annual commitment exceeds \u00a3100 million to make sure the commitment is taken seriously.\n\nUnder the new policy schools will source specialist coaching provision from sports clubs and governing bodies, with the Football Association and the Premier League, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union and the Lawn Tennis Association all committed to supporting the scheme.\n\nIt is hoped their involvement will allow schools to be more flexible, though critics fear that the policy does not address the fundamental problem of the lack of specialist PE training provided to teachers.\n\nIn a compromise intended to appease Gove\u2019s commitment to decentralising education, the funding will be ring-fenced but will be paid direct to schools, and decisions on how lessons are provided will be made at a local level. Head teachers will be encouraged to source coaching expertise via the county sports partnerships already funded by Sport England.\n\nMinisters have long conceded privately that the lack of a coherent school sport policy has been a glaring hole in its 2012 legacy planning and undermined the Olympic pledge to \u201cinspire a generation\u201d.\n\nOne of the Government\u2019s first acts after the 2010 election was to cut \u00a3162 million-a-year of ring-fenced funding for school sport, an ideological decision driven by Gove\u2019s conviction that individual heads should have the power to spend budgets as they pleased rather than follow central diktat.\n\nAs a consequence around half of the school sports partnerships established across the country were swept away, and monitoring of their work was ended leaving the impact unclear.\n\nThe changes, less than two years before the London Olympics, were a huge own-goal and a backlash led by Olympians prompted a partial about-turn, and the reduced funding provided runs out at the end of the current academic year.\n\nWhile funding for elite athletes and grassroots sports was agreed last year, provision for the most crucial area of all has been held up by Gove\u2019s reluctance to change course.\n\nGiven the central role schools play in inspiring an interest in sport, as well as instilling a commitment to exercise, the lack of progress represents a damning omission.\n\nNegotiations have been glacial, with Gove and Hunt fundamentally disagreeing over the way forward. As culture secretary, Hunt became persuaded of the power of sport to inspire an interest in an active lifestyle, but wanted the funding ring-fenced.\n\nThat runs counter to the entire direction of Gove\u2019s reforms, and the pair reached an impasse that meant an announcement was pushed back from a planned launch date last December.\n\nCoe is understood to have played a key role in fashioning a compromise. As a Tory peer and former MP the London 2012 chairman is sympathetic with the reform agenda, but as an Olympian whose passion was sparked by teachers in a Sheffield state school in the 1960s, he is just as convinced of the importance of proper sport provision to the education of the nation\u2019s children.\n\nThe agreed compromise is expected to mean schools receive guaranteed funding but commission services themselves locally while Ofsted, which recently published a damning assessment of state school sport, will provide quality control.\n\nThe focus on primary schools is an attempt to redress the fact that most teachers receive only cursory training in PE, as well as to try and capture the imagination of children at their most receptive.\n\nThe involvement of governing bodies is consistent with the government\u2019s attempts to spread responsibility for sports provision away from the state. Grassroots funding to governing bodies for example is conditional on them working with their clubs to increase participation.\n\nThe FA and Premier League believe their clubs can offer a service to schools, with community coaches ready to work within the curriculum or after school and at weekends depending on a school's requirements.\n\nIf this is to be judged as a serious commitment to the health and educational benefits of sport rather than a sticking plaster, it must reach all schools, not just those who by accident of geography end up close to a major professional sports institution", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01782/PaulKelso_60_1782322j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript",

From a young age I was fairly natural at sport. Coming from a big family I would play all sorts of sports with my brothers and sisters.

Looking up, he points towards the Olympic Stadium, the jutting ArcelorMittal Orbit, the rolling lines of the Zaha Hadid-designed Aquatics Centre, and poses the question with which he and scores of others are now wrestling. 'Why would people cross the bridge, leave the comfort of retail therapy and go over to the park?\u2019 he asks.\n\nBy Hone\u2019s maths, there will be 9.3 billion visitors to London\u2019s newest attraction, the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park , by 2016. But on this bleak, overcast day the park\u2019s appeal has fallen about as low as the unseasonal spring temperatures. The joy and ebullience of tens of thousands of spectators is long absent; the feats of athleticism, bravery and skill in the park\u2019s various stadiums have given way to the mundane grind of giant earthmoving equipment and scores of purposeful men in hi-vis jackets. Not only do the Olympics and Paralympics seem a distant memory, so do many of the physical elements of this revitalised square mile in east London. Gone are the colossal wings of the Aquatic Centre, and the last of the basketball arena\u2019s skeletal structure. Much of the park is already unrecognisable \u2013 not that many people are allowed to see it.\n\nFor the past 10 months wire fencing, patrolled 24 hours by security, has shrouded the site of the capital\u2019s greatest modern triumph. It will remain there for the rest of this year, rendering much of the park off-limits to the public.\n\nYet inside, the long-term vision for this vast space is beginning to take shape. When it is completed there will be two new schools, 1.9 million square feet of retail and entertainment areas, 22 miles of cycle- and footpaths, nine miles of new roads and four miles of waterways \u2013 and five world-class sporting venues. To help ease London\u2019s housing shortage there will be about 8,000 new homes. If you were lucky enough to have visited this part of town last summer you might struggle to get your bearings.\n\nHone admits that the site is going to feel very different, but so it should. 'The experience of the Games wasn\u2019t about the physical buildings,\u2019 he says. 'It was the banners, the way the park was dressed, the enthusiasm of the volunteers. And it was all for an event, for the 17 days of the Olympics and 12 days of the Paralympics. In the future the park has got to have many functions. We want it to have that magic we saw at the Olympics and Paralympics, but it can\u2019t be a Disneyland with razzmatazz every day. It has to have days where it is tranquil, when people can walk the dog, fly a kite and have a picnic. Then on other days we want major events, to have it as a fantastic destination and visitor attraction. We want to get that balance right, and that is quite difficult.\u2019\n\n\n\nA new velopark with incorporate the Olympic BMX track (Jason Orton)\n\nSome cities \u2013 notably Athens, Moscow and Beijing \u2013 failed to get the balance right once the Olympic circus left town. None of those cities seriously thought about what would happen to their arenas and facilities post-Games, or the huge costs of maintaining them.\n\nYet from the moment in July 2005 London won the right to host the 30th Olympiad, the most overused word associated with it has been 'legacy\u2019. The constant refrain, from politicians to members of the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) and the organising committee Locog, was that the park would have a vibrant life post-Games, which would benefit the local population and the country in general. The London Olympics would be the gift that kept on giving.\n\nSo far the only people reaping any financial reward from the London 2012 have been the owners and tenants of Westfield Stratford City, where \u00a317 billion worth of transport links installed ahead of the Games have brought the public flocking in their thousands \u2013 to go shopping. The 1.88 million sq ft site saw \u00a3950 million of sales throughout 2012.\n\nWestfield Stratford City was an enormous gamble for the Australian shopping centre magnate Frank Lowy but his investment has paid off handsomely. John Burton, Westfield\u2019s director of development, says, 'Westfield [Stratford] has exceeded all expectations and attracted 8.5 million visitors over the Games period alone. In its first year of trading [it opened in September 2011] we had 47 million visitors, breaking all sales records for the company.\u2019\n\nYet retail was only ever a small part of the 'legacy\u2019 masterplan. Nearly two years ago that post-Olympic plan, known as the Legacy Community Scheme, was approved by the ODA. It had been an enormously complicated process, with eight different design codes to pass muster and 20 separate planning statements, yet had faced relatively muted opposition. It helped that the ODA acts as both the planning body and the consent authority, and that everything falls under the Mayor of London Boris Johnson\u2019s control as the chairman of the LLDC.\n\nThe few voices of dissent that could be heard in advance of the Games have largely fallen silent. The majority of locals in the surrounding boroughs now acknowledge that the development has added much-needed investment and improved facilities to one of London\u2019s most neglected areas. All of which has afforded the politicians on Johnson\u2019s London Assembly and the LLDC\u2019s board members \u2013 most of them business leaders \u2013 the freedom and flexibility to continue the transformation of the site.\n\n\n\nThe Copper Box will reopen as a multi-sport arena in July 2013 (Jason Orton)\n\nIn its promotional material the LLDC promises that the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park 'will be the UK\u2019s most exciting urban park, unlike any other park you have visited. Whatever your age, background or interests, here you\u2019ll find something you\u2019re into \u2013 from extraordinary new experiences to ordinary activities in extraordinary surroundings.\u2019\n\nThe site will comprise two distinct areas, bisected by the newly constructed Waterden Road, the busy western access to Westfield Stratford City. The northern part of the park is centred on the Lee Valley, and will comprise lush landscaped parklands, a velopark (including a new mountain-bike course, and the revamped Olympic BMX track), a business district, hockey and tennis centres, and a recently-approved low-rise development of 850 homes, known as Chobham Manor, located where the temporary Olympic basketball arena stood. This section of the park is meant to be a relaxed, largely natural area that will be gated and shut to non-residents from dusk to dawn. The first residents of this area are expected to be in situ within the next two years.\n\nAdjacent to the old media and broadcast centre, a development of 1,200-1,500 homes, called East Wick, may be fast-tracked in the next 12 months (ahead of its original five- to eight-year timescale) so that the entire northern park will be completed within a few short years. Already the business district is taking shape: the first tenant for the Olympic media centre, BT Vision, has moved in; the rest of the cavernous space is being leased through a business conglomeration named iCity, which is pursuing creative and digital companies for its \u00a3100 million redevelopment.\n\nThe area to the south of Waterden Road will have a more fast-paced feel, although the building work is progressing much more slowly. It is being developed around a plaza hub between the Olympic Stadium and the Aquatics Centre, and surrounded by high-rise housing. One of the South Plaza\u2019s most anticipated commissions is a 55-acre landscaping project designed by the New York-based Briton James Corner, who was responsible for the acclaimed New York High Line, which transformed a section of derelict elevated railway in Manhattan into one of the city\u2019s most popular new attractions. Corner\u2019s London proposal is no less ambitious, with a wide tree-lined promenade branching out into areas designed for a variety of cultural activities, with carousels, climbing walls and picnic spots, and spaces for music and food festivals.\n\nYet many aspects of the South Plaza remain undecided, and previously agreed plans are being re-evaluated. There is growing speculation that some of the planned housing (a thousand or more homes) could be scrapped at the expense of other yet to be determined visitor attractions; a museum, a university and exhibition centres have all been mentioned.\n\nAccording to Neale Coleman, the Mayor of London\u2019s Olympic adviser and an LLDC board member, the Legacy Community Scheme always allowed for a degree of flexibility. The planners, he adds, can now afford to be more ambitious because, in short, last summer exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations. 'The Games were so successful, the transport worked so well and people have experienced the park, and so they are starting to accept that Stratford is part of central London,\u2019 he says. 'It has completely changed the perception of the area.\u2019\n\n\n\nPlans for the South Plaza include tree-lined boulevades (Jason Orton)\n\nWhile the planners keep an open mind significant questions remain unanswered, not least regarding the total cost of the park, how much of it is coming from the public purse, and when it will all be finished. The park\u2019s website still states that 'the transformation project to turn the Olympic site into Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park started straight after the end of the Games and is anticipated to take 18 months\u2019. However, the planning application section of the LLDC\u2019s website paints a more long-term picture, stating that 'the redevelopment... is to be phased over a considerable period of time, spanning roughly 25-30 years\u2019.\n\nThe park will host its first major events since last summer at the end of this month, starting with the music festival Hard Rock Calling, headlined by Bruce Springsteen. 'We\u2019ll go from bulldozers to the Boss,\u2019 Dennis Hone says with a smile.\n\nA few weeks later the Olympic Stadium will host the London Sainsbury\u2019s Anniversary Games, three days of Diamond League athletics action featuring a number of A-list Olympic stars including Usain Bolt, Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah. But other sections of the south park will take many years to complete. According to the most recent schedule the last of the park\u2019s houses are not due to be finished until 2030, although Neale Coleman now says that residents could be moving in a decade sooner.\n\n\n\nThe view towards the former athletes' village, now renamed East Village (Jason Orton)\n\nBoris Johnson, sensing rumblings of impatience, has insisted the public facilities of the park be reopened as quickly as possible, which is why a middle third of the park \u2013 incorporating the Olympic handball arena, the Copper Box (London\u2019s third-largest arena), and reworked garden areas down to the river \u2013 will be opened in July, six months ahead of schedule.\n\nBut it will be next January before the velodrome is in action for club cycling competitions (before becoming a national training centre) and the middle of next year before the Aquatics Centre will welcome its first public swimmers. Although it is hoped that the first residents will move into what was once the athletes\u2019 village in September, the renamed East Village is currently still being retrofitted with kitchens.\n\nAbout half of the 2,800-plus homes have been earmarked for affordable housing \u2013 part of Hone\u2019s commitment that 30 per cent of all housing on the park be affordable (a third of that will be social rent, a third shared ownership, and the rest available at 80 per cent market price). This hasn\u2019t stopped low-income earners in nearby Newham raising concerns that they may be priced out of the new accommodation.\n\nSome would argue that a greater cause for concern is that the remaining East Village homes were sold in late 2011 to Qatari Diar, the ruling family of Qatar\u2019s development company, for \u00a3557 million in a deal which has left British taxpayers, who had contributed the equivalent of \u00a3800 million for requisition of the land and construction costs, out of pocket by over \u00a3200 million.\n\n\n\nDennis Hone, CEO of the London Legacy Development Corporation (Jason Orton)\n\nHone, an accountant by trade, believes that the money will be easily recouped in profitmaking sales of other future development plots on the Olympic Park but he is acutely aware of the need to balance the books. The government purse contributed more than \u00a37 billion to the construction and infrastructure of Olympic Park out of the total \u00a39.3 billion cost of hosting the Games (the rest went largely towards security and transport) and part of Hone\u2019s job now is to ensure that, in legacy, that was money well spent. Which in the middle of a recession and with rising costs has not been easy.\n\nIt was always the case that \u00a3300 million of taxpayers\u2019 money would be spent reshaping the park after the Games, but the final budget looks like being more than double that amount. The Government has already allocated a further \u00a3150 million, but more will be needed.\n\nFurthermore, \u00a3650 million must be returned to the government\u2019s Big Lottery Fund which was drawn down when the initial plans to have private enterprise pay for the vast media centre and athletes village went belly-up with the recession, and there is also the \u00a310 million a year Boris Johnson has pledged to set aside in upkeep for the park.\n\n'Ideally the park would pay for itself,\u2019 John Biggs, the local Labour politician who also oversees the London Assembly\u2019s budget committee, says. 'I would be disappointed if it costs a great deal. The park has to generate its own income.\u2019 That means, among other things, selling the naming rights to venues, and charging the public to use them.\n\n\n\nWest Ham United will become tenants of the Olympic Stadium (Jason Orton)\n\nThe arrival of Premier League football will bring much-needed cash into the park. Last month, after delays, confusion and legal threats, the 99-year tenancy of the \u00a3429 million Olympic Stadium was granted to West Ham United. It came with a proviso that the stadium be modified, with \u00a3200 million of new retractable seating, so that it can still serve its original purpose as an athletics venue (it will host the 2017 World Athletics Championships). To get the deal over the line the Government contributed another \u00a325 million; Newham Council put in \u00a340 million.\n\nHone said the West Ham deal was 'an important milestone\u2019 and showed that 'we remain firmly on track to deliver a meaningful physical and social legacy for Londoners\u2019. That means the park is on its way to becoming a place Londoners \u2013 and people from all over the world \u2013 will want to visit.\n\n'We want people to have a cluster of reasons to go there on a wet windy February afternoon,\u2019 Hone tells me as we look out of his office window. 'If we build houses for them, that might be the solution, but we need other things \u2013 cultural things, educational things, rich sporting offers, clubs, cafes, bars, so that once it\u2019s there it will be there for 50 years. I don\u2019t think people understand how exciting the park will be once it\u2019s finished.\u2019", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark3_2593787c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark2_2593745c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01805/Jacquelin_Magnay_6_1805943j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark5_2593732c.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark8_2593781c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark9_2593756c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark1_2593738c.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark6_2593718c.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark7_2593709k.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark7_2593709b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02593/olympicpark7_2593709k.jpg", "date": "25/06/2013"}, "rank_1": {"title": "London's Olympic legacy - the results are in", "text": "It\u2019s almost 12 months since the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games took place. The miles of bunting and vibrant pink branding are long gone. The city-wide volunteers, in their magenta shirts and straw trilby hats, have been absorbed back into the city and, away from Stratford at least, there is very little visually left to remind anyone that an event of such magnitude came and went in a matter of weeks. There were winners and losers on the field of play and winners and losers in the tourism industry. A year on, have the losers recouped their loses and did the forecasts come true?\n\nPrior to the Olympics, London and Britain were anticipating a decrease in visitor numbers during Games time. This is caused by the phenomenon of \u2018displacement\u2019 where visitors stay away from a major event\u2019s host city due to fears of disruption, expense and overcrowding.\n\nData reveals that this forecast was correct. Britain saw a 5 per cent year-on-year decrease in visitor numbers during August 2012. Regular tourists stayed away and were replaced by Olympic ticket-holding visitors, mainly from the UK, who spent most of their time at the Games venues watching Olympic and Paralympic action. However, these \u2018Olympic-motivated visitors\u2019 spent more and Britain saw a 9 per cent increase in overseas-visitor spending during this period.\n\nDuring the first week of the Olympic Games, media around the world reported that London was a \u201cghost town\u201d reflecting the absence of regular tourists in hot spots such as the West End and at popular tourist attractions. Locals were encouraged to stay off the transport system and dutifully did so. West End footfall plummeted and attractions experienced decreases of up to 50 per cent in visitor numbers.\n\nMany attractions were badly hit during the Games, but spare a thought for those that became Olympic venues and had to close altogether. One such attraction, the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum, had to close due to the venue being used for Olympic tennis. Obviously the attraction took a hit during the Games, but bounced back in September and in the first five months of this year is more than 7 per cent up on the same period in 2012.\n\nYear on year, both Britain and London predicted flat growth for 2012, knowing that some international visitors would be deterred from visiting while domestic visitors, who made up about 90 per cent of ticket holders, would pour into the city at Games time. Data from the Office of National Statistics\u2019 International Passenger Survey (IPS) marry with the prediction showing 31 million overseas visitors to Britain during that time, up just 1 per cent, but with domestic visits to London up 9.5 per cent. In total, domestic visitors spent 16 per cent more in 2012 than 2011.\n\nBut has Britain had its moment of glory and is it all downhill from here? Not so, says VisitBritain, who through its \u2018GREAT\u2019 campaign is continuing to promote Britain off the back of the hugely refreshed profile created by the Games. \u201cWe\u2019re well known for our rich heritage and cultural offer, but now people around the world are more aware of things like our beautiful countryside, vibrant music scene, excellent shopping experience and the warmth of our welcome\u201d said VisitBritain's CEO Sandie Dawe. They predict an increase of 1million visitors this year. An optimistic prediction considering that most of Britain\u2019s competitors are outspending VisitBritain in all of its key markets. By 2020, they hope Britain will welcome 40m visitors annually - a 3 per cent year-on-year rise.\n\nLondon has plenty more to reveal. There are a host of \u201cnew\u201d physical legacy projects that were created as a result of the Games. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will host two events to mark the anniversary of the Games - Open East Festival and the Sainsbury\u2019s Anniversary Games \u2013 as well as the music festivals Hard Rock Calling and Wireless. Ride London, a new mass participation cycling event, The Orbit, cultural events and other sporting events such as the 2015 Rugby World Cup and World Athletics Championships in 2017 will continue to give visitors further reasons to visit the area.\n\nTFL invested \u00a36.5bn in upgrading the transport infrastructure and concentrated on ensuring ticket holders got to their venues. During the Games, the Tube carried over 101 million passengers \u2013 up by 28 per cent on normal levels \u2013 including the most ever carried on a single day, 4.52m. Post-Games, the Tube continues to run more reliably and transports more Londoners and visitors than at any time in its history.\n\nThe spotlight still seems to be shining on London and Britain, but I predict this window will start to shrink. Complacency can\u2019t be allowed to creep in and budgets should be increased, not reduced. Ufi Ibrahim, Chief Executive of the British Hospitality Association said: \"\u2026Post 2012 the sector is fairing well, but our huge potential for growth is being hampered by Government neglect of the sector\". The spectacle of Brazil is also waiting in the wings. With the World Cup in 2014 and the OIympics in 2016, the world\u2019s attention will soon head to the southern hemisphere.\n\nCan Britain and London withstand the emergence of a new megastar when it comes to securing global attention? \u201cIt\u2019s natural and inevitable that the spotlight switches\u201d commented Mike Lee, chairman of Vero Communications, who was communications director for the London 2012 bid and who provided strategic advice to Rio 2016, \u201cbut it won\u2019t be to the detriment of London, it won\u2019t diminish the affection and pride people have for London.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s shock absorbers may be tested to the limit, but, as ever, I think this tiny island\u2019s international tourism economy will survive. It might not have a lot of sun, sand and samba, but that\u2019s not its offer and never has been. As I was once reminded by an American visitor \u201cit\u2019s Britain \u2013 we always take an umbrella\u201d.\n\nMartine Ainsworth Wells was the marketing and communications director for London & Partners before and during the Games period.

overlooked as host for 2018 Youth Olympics", "text": "Hoy, who was part of the Glasgow delegation in Lausanne and watched in the audience as British Olympic Association chairman Lord Coe led a slick 15-minute presentation, was incredulous after the city polled just 13 votes out of the total 85 cast in the first round. Buenos Aires secured 40 votes and the Colombian city of Medellin polled 32.\n\nWith Glasgow duly eliminated, the election was reduced to a two-way fight in the final round and the IOC membership confounded expectation by choosing the Argentine capital by 49 votes to 39 in a decision that reeked of internal politics.\n\nIn an evaluation report on the pros and cons of each bid, Buenos Aires had been rated the weakest of the three candidates because of its chilly climate when the Games are due to take place in the summer of 2018 and, more seriously, doubts about its financial guarantees.\n\nIn the same report, Glasgow and Medellin had received high praise for the quality of their sports facilities and were given \u201clow-risk\u201d tags by IOC inspectors.\n\nHoy said: \u201cI\u2019m shocked. We could never be confident of winning but I never expected to go out in the first round.\n\n\u201cI thought the presentation was excellent and I genuinely don\u2019t think we could have done any more. It was flawless, I thought. But you never know how these things work in terms of the politics of the voting.\u201d\n\nCoe, whose involvement in the bid presentation brought back memories of his stirring speech to the IOC eight years ago when London was awarded the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics, urged members to vote for Glasgow because \u201cit is a warm city and a welcoming city with an unstoppable spirit of fun\u201d.\n\nBut this time, Coe\u2019s oratory was not enough to outweigh the obvious disadvantage facing Glasgow \u2014 the fact that London had hosted the Olympics less than a year ago.\n\nCoe said: \u201cClearly, the guys in Glasgow put the proposition together but timing is everything and there is no doubt that there were a few members who were very positive about Glasgow but were clearly thinking about the proximity of London.\n\n\u201cOur friends in Glasgow have run a very good campaign and made a lot of friends in the movement.\u201d\n\nThe star turn of Glasgow\u2019s presentation was 15-year-old schoolgirl Lizzie Pollard, who told the story of her move from her birthplace in Guyana to Glasgow to show how the city welcomed people from all ethnic backgrounds. After the vote was announced, she broke down in tears.\n\nScotland\u2019s sports minister, Shona Robison, said: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed but it\u2019s been an honour to have been involved with a fantastic bid and great to get to the shortlist with two other very strong bids.\n\n\u201cTo engage 1\u00bd million young people in Scotland and the UK in the bid process has been hugely rewarding and we\u2019re going to take some of the programmes forward with the Commonwealth Games next year in Glasgow, so there\u2019ll be a legacy from the bidding process.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/hoy_2608904b.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02099/Simon-Hart_3_60_2099286j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/hoy_2608904k.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/hoy_2608904k.jpg", "date": "04/07/2013"}, "rank_2": {"title": "London's Olympic legacy: have the Games inspired a generation?", "text": "The first anniversary of the London Olympics will soon be here, yet all that razzmatazz and those golden celebrations seem to be in the distant past now. Some of the venues that echoed with the cheers of British sports fans have already been dismantled, some have reverted to their former uses and others are undergoing the building work that will equip them for the next phases of their useful lives.\n\nThe physical legacy \u2013 especially in the East End of London \u2013 is indisputable, even though the precise destiny of some of the sites remains to be decided. The debate about the financial costs and benefits continues, and I suspect that it will never be resolved. I know from friends Down Under that nobody has yet been able to work out how much the Sydney Games cost or brought in, and that was 13 years ago.\n\nBut I want to focus on the human legacy of the London Games, and in particular the impact that they had on Britain\u2019s youth. The mission statement for 2012 included a pledge to \u201cInspire a generation\u201d, and I want to find out if it succeeded.\n\nI have noticed an impact close to home \u2013 more people seem to be cycling and running near where we live in Sussex, and there are so many children trying to sign up at Phoenix AC, my local athletics club in Brighton, that it has had to introduce a waiting list. It is great to see that enthusiasm \u2014 but not to see youngsters having to wait to have a go at their chosen sport.\n\nSome, I know, have not been able to have a go at all. My 11-year-old son Luca was inspired by the gymnastics at the Games, in particular by Louis Smith. \u201cThat\u2019s the sport for me,\u201d Luca said, and marched me off to our local gymnasium so he could sign up. But no coaching places were available.\n\nIt\u2019s true that gymnastics is a sport in which it is important to start young, and one in which we don\u2019t have a great heritage of male stars, but I still think it is a shame that Luca didn\u2019t get a chance to have a go \u2013 and I can\u2019t help wondering how often that scene was repeated, in different age groups and in different sports, elsewhere in the country.\n\nIt is not enough to inspire a generation, though that is a noble aim. You also have to inspire (and pay) the coaches who will instruct them, and get a positive message across to the parents who will have to drive them to and from training, and who will have to buy \u2013 and maintain \u2013 their kit and equipment.\n\nRecently, Sport England published figures on participation in this country since the Games, which made grim reading: 100,000 fewer people are participating in the sports it funds in April 2013 than in April 2012. That can\u2019t be good. But if you drill down into the data it becomes clear that the drop includes a lot of adults doing sports that have been affected by the lousy winter and the harsh economic climate, while the numbers of young people and women doing sport have increased.\n\nFor this series I\u2019ve interviewed a Home Counties canoeist, a family of cyclists in the north-east and a young dressage rider in the Midlands. Everywhere I have found people inspired by the Games. But I\u2019ve also found that more needs to be done to keep spreading the message, and to support those whose sporting careers have barely begun.\n\nSally Gunnell, pictured after winning the Olympic gold medal in the 400m hurdles in 1992 (Pic: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTalent bubbles to the top\n\nOur first Legacy case study is a visit to the venue where Britain\u2019s athletes paddled to gold\n\nThe best place to start any consideration of the legacy of the 2012 Olympics for Great Britain is at a venue that was created for the Games \u2013 that would not have existed had it not been for the Games \u2013 and which will continue to thrive after the Games.\n\nIf in years to come anyone wants to know what the Olympics brought to Britain beyond the Olympic Park in Stratford, the Lee Valley White Water Centre, in an otherwise unlovely spot where London, Essex, Hertfordshire and the M25 meet, will be the most concrete and sophisticated monument to be found.\n\nThe foaming flume where Team GB\u2019s paddlers won gold and silver in the canoe slalom (C2) event was built on a former car park at a capital cost of more than \u00a330 million. Before the Games it was trumpeted by the organisers as a venue with a solid, quantifiable legacy \u2013 unlike the main stadium at Stratford, for example, whose future was speculative when it was built (though its future is now secure with West Ham United football club.)\n\nThe White Water Centre is now in the throes of a \u00a36 million post-Games refit but it continues to function meanwhile, proving popular not only with local stag parties but also with the national elite squads and keen young beginners, more than 50 of whom train there every week. Which is where Fraser Smalley comes in.\n\nIf you wanted to embarrass him, you might say that Smalley, a lean, bespectacled 14 year-old, is the embodiment of the London legacy: a kid switched on to a sport by watching British success at a purpose-built permanent venue, now hoping to emulate that success by developing his skills at the very same venue where his heroes triumphed.\n\nSmalley remembers the day his dream was kindled, at home last summer. \u201cThe rest of the family had gone out, but I stayed home because I wanted to watch the C2 final on TV. One of the British team, Etienne Stott, trains up the road from where we live in Bedford so when he won the gold with his partner and I saw him on top of the podium it was just \u2026 it was inspirational, really. It made me feel that I want to be there myself one day.\u201d\n\nSome would be content to dream. But Smalley comes from a generation enabled by technology not only to gawp at their heroes but to get in touch with them too.\n\n\u201cI just tweeted Etienne and asked how I could get started in canoeing \u2013 I was amazed when he tweeted back. He told me who to get in touch with, so I emailed GB Canoeing, and they told me when the first session was and where to go. It just seemed really easy \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy\u201d because, like all the British sports represented at the Games, canoeing had anticipated increased interest, and sharply increased interest in the event of medals, and had plans in place to channel the interest of young people such as Smalley.\n\nA further priceless advantage is that the young would-be canoeist lived within what you might call keen-parent distance of the White Water Centre. As I know from personal experience both as athlete and parent, any youngster starting out on a career in sport depends, to a huge extent, on the support of their parents \u2013 not just financially, but in time and enthusiasm.\n\nKeen-parent distance, in this case, is a three-hour round trip in the car from their home in Cambridgeshire to every training session, so it was enormously important in the earliest encounters not only that Fraser should feel welcome to have a go at canoeing, but that his parents, Robert and Nicky, also felt comfortable with the sport.\n\n\u201cWe were really worried the first time we came down to the Lee Valley Centre,\u201d said Nicky. \u201cWe had no idea what to expect.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thought we might be overstepping the mark,\u201d Robert agrees. \u201cBut they were happy for anyone to have a go.\u201d\n\nFraser now trains twice a week in a group of mostly 13- to 16-year-olds, with one or two older paddlers in the water. \u201cSo there are people who have done it all before who we can learn from,\u201d Fraser says. On the bank will be his parents and older brother Alex, always ready to point out if Fraser has missed a slalom gate.\n\nBut also present will be Shaun Pearce, GB Canoeing\u2019s head coach, who keeps a regular eye on the young paddlers at the lowest level of the pyramid of talent while also keeping the country\u2019s elite squad up to the mark. Etienne Stott is also a regular not only on the course but on the bank, and is taking an interest in Fraser\u2019s progress. \u201cHe says I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Fraser says. \u201cHe reckons I just need to eat more pies.\u201d\n\nSally Gunnell OBE won the gold medal in the 400m hurdles at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, is a former world record holder and is the only woman to have held Commonwealth, European, World and Olympic track titles concurrently.\n\nAs the mother of three sons, she is committed to promoting greater fitness and wellbeing for families in the UK.\n\nLet Sally know if your Olympic inspiration has been fulfilled or frustrated by emailing weekend@telegraph.co.uk with \u201cSally Gunnell\u201d in the subject field.\n\nLondon 2012: what remains\n\nAll change: the Olympics stadium, soon to be a home for West Ham United FC (Rex Features)\n\nThe Olympic Stadium has been sold to West Ham United FC on a 99-year lease. Following redevelopment, the stadium will be used as the club\u2019s home ground starting in the 2016-17 season. The stadium will be used for live music events and for matches at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. It is also a likely venue for the 2017 World Athletics and IPC Athletics World Championships.\n\nThe Olympic Village residential complex will be made into 2,818 new homes; a school, Chobham Academy, will accept 1,800 pupils aged 3-19.\n\nThe Aquatics Centre is being transformed into a public facility, attracting an anticipated 800,000 visitors a year, alongside elite swimmers. The two temporary wings for extra spectator seats are being removed.\n\nThe hockey pitches at the Olympic Park will be used in the 2015 EuroHockey Nations Championships.\n\nThe Velodrome will form the heart of a new VeloPark for use by the local community, clubs and elite athletes.\n\nThe Copper Box, used in the Games as a venue for handball events and the modern pentathlon, will be developed into a multi-use sports centre for community use, athlete training and events.\n\nThe temporary seating at the BMX cycling track at the Olympic Park will be removed and the track itself will be reconfigured to make it suitable for riders of all ages and abilities.\n\nHadleigh Farm in Essex, the mountain biking venue, will adapt the mountain bike course for use by the public.\n\nThe Lee Valley White Water Centre (see feature) remains open to the public and elite athletes during redevelopment. It will host the 2015 Canoe Slalom World Championships.\n\nKate Bagger", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/wk-olympics06070_3_2608965a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/wk-olympics06070_1_2608960a.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/canoe_2608955b.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/canoe_2608955a.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/canoe_2608955a.jpg", "date": "11/07/2013"}, "rank_5": {"title": "London's Olympic legacy: the flame starts a chain reaction", "text": "Last week I opened this series with a visit to the Lee Valley White Water Centre, and while it\u2019s good to have seen young people enjoying sport at a legacy venue close to the Games in London, I wondered what effect the Olympics had had far from the capital, and what kind of legacy had been left for those who had encountered the Games only on television.\n\nThe dismal figures for adult participation in sport in this country since 2012, released by Sport England, do not suggest a \u201chalo effect\u201d rippling out to enthuse all areas and all generations.\n\nBut in the North, cycling, one of the sports which, according to the figures, has seen a steep decline since the Olympics, is generating unprecedented interest among young people. The region\u2019s representatives from British Cycling have suggested that they are barely keeping pace with the demand for introductions to the sport.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredible,\u201d said Dan Small, British Cycling development manager for the North East. \u201cAnd we know that the interest from young people is the same nationally \u2014 our under-18 membership is up 40 per cent since the Games.\u201d\n\nThe Robson family from Prudhoe in Northumberland are evidence of cycling\u2019s multi-generational appeal, and also suggests that the \u201cLondon effect\u201d had power even beyond our shores.\n\n\u201cWe were actually in France when the Games started,\u201d recalls Jason Robson, 42, a medical scientist. \u201cWe watched the opening ceremony on television there and it made us feel very patriotic.\u201d Back home Robson and his wife, Suzanne, 34, a nurse, and their sons Daniel, 10, Rhys, seven, and Spencer, three, took a special interest in the cycling events. Jason, a once-keen hobby rider, found his interest reawakened as his sons switched on to the sport for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe all got very involved in the Games,\u201d Jason says. \u201cWe were shouting for Lizzie Armitstead in the final sprint. Suzanne, Daniel and I had watched a documentary about Victoria Pendleton before the Olympics and we were really inspired by it. So we all were rooting for her to do well. That Olympic spirit, the dedication and determination really shone through and touched us. Daniel still says he wants to be a professional cyclist!\u201d\n\nThe boys\u2019 grandfather, Bob, and their grandmother, Chris, had cycled down to join the family party on the undulating mountain bike track at Whickham Thorns, just south of Newcastle. Nothing unusual about that, Jason said, as we all watched Daniel and Rhys bombing around the track. \u201cWe often ride together. We did 23 miles one day near York, and the grandparents came along that day too. Cycling gives us a good day out, and we\u2019ve enjoyed watching the boys in their cyclo-cross races over the winter too. Cycling keeps us all fit, active and outdoors. Suzanne and I both work in cardiothoracic medicine, so we realise first hand how important that is.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to square my experience in Newcastle, and everything that British Cycling have told me, with figures that suggest that 50,000 fewer people are cycling every week now than before the Olympics. All I can think is that older cyclists may have been forced by economic conditions to put their sport on hold \u2014 but all the evidence suggests that a new generation will soon be along to take their place.\n\nLEGACIES OF OTHER OLYMPIC GAMES\n\nBy Andrew Baker\n\nBarcelona 1992\n\nThe template for a transformative Games\n\nPlus Remodelled the city and its international image\n\nMinus Public debt of \u00a34 billion\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably no better place on Earth to look to for inspiration than Barcelona, where the 1992 Olympics transformed the city into the vibrant and successful place it is today\u201d.

Every day you saw it being visible in a way it\u2019s normally not.\u201d\n\nThe challenge, he said, would be finding volunteers the right positions to suit them.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/games-makers-usain_2334664b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/games-makers-usain_2334664k.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01768/Mason_60_1768768j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02328/jump_2328341g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/parade-fans_2334695g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/athletes-summary_2334882g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02359/wiggo-team_g_2359133g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02327/summary_2327839g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02334/games-makers-usain_2334664k.jpg", "date": "20/07/2013"}, "rank_22": {"title": "'Staggering\u2019 pay-off for the \u00a31m Olympic Games boss", "text": "Dennis Hone, the former chief executive of the Olympic Delivery Authority, received almost \u00a31 million last year in salary, bonuses, pension \u00adcontributions and severance pay, according to the organisation\u2019s annual report.\n\nOn the eve of the first anniversary of the London 2012 Games, it emerged that he and three other executives received pay-offs worth \u00a3638,000 between them.\n\nIn total, 144 officials who left the Olympic Delivery Authority over the past year were given \u00a32.8 million in compensation between them.\n\nThe executives received the pay-offs because they were put on permanent contracts, despite the fact that the authority is due to wind down after 2014.\n\nStephen Barclay, a Conservative member of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: \u201cI am deeply concerned to learn of these staggering pay-offs, which are clearly out of touch with the principle of the Olympics legacy and supporting grass-roots sport.\n\n\u201cIt is perverse. We knew when the Olympics were going to finish, and executives should not be allowed to profit like this.\u201d\n\nMr Hone was appointed as chief executive of the authority in February 2011, replacing Sir David Higgins, who joined Network Rail.\n\nMr Hone was paid \u00a3233,000 in salary, a bonus of \u00a3153,000 and received \u00a336,000 in pension contributions. He also spent two days a week as interim chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, the body overseeing the legacy of the Olympic Park. He was paid \u00a390,000 for this. The two jobs brought his total pay package last year to \u00a3512,000.\n\nIn addition, he was given an \u00a380,000 exit package, including a \u201cterminal bonus\u201d and redundancy pay. The authority also paid an extra \u00a3373,000 into his pension pot. This meant that in total, he was paid \u00a3965,000 last year.\n\nHe was entitled to the pay-off because Jeremy Hunt, the former culture secretary who is now Health Secretary, put him on a permanent contract when he appointed him.\n\nMr Hone has since been appointed as the full-time chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, where his basic pay is \u00a3195,000 a year.\n\nBoris Johnson, the Mayor of London, has praised him for his \u201cwealth of skills and experience\u201d.\n\nA spokesman for the authority said payments to Mr Hone were \u201clegal and contractual

savings of over \u00a31 billion.\n\n\u201cWe had to adopt a flexible approach to managing staff contracts to ensure that key people, especially directors, remained with the project throughout periods

\u201cpump-priming\u201d over sustained investment.\n\nIt was claimed that PE lessons were still not good enough in almost a third of primary schools, with some teachers given just one day\u2019s training to deliver the subject.\n\nThe cross-party group warned that too many schools had \u201cinadequate access\u201d to high-quality facilities such as swimming pools, preventing children meeting the national requirement to swim 25 metres by the age of 11.\n\nPolicies designed to get more children to take part in competitive sports such as football, rugby or netball \u2013 a centrepiece of Government PE reforms \u2013 can also \u201cdeter many young people from taking part in sport at all\u201d, the report said.\n\nA study last week found that the UK economy had seen a \u00a39.9bn boost in trade and investment from hosting the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nMinisters have repeatedly claimed that the Games would have a positive impact on school sport.\n\nBut research last year found that half of children failed to do at least two hours of PE each week and one-in-seven teenagers did not get any sport at all in the last year of school.\n\nIn today\u2019s report, MPs praised a number of Government reforms such as the pledge to train 120 new primary PE specialists but insisted it would have limited impact on England\u2019s 17,000 primary schools.\n\nIt was also pointed out that new \u201cprimary sport premium\u201d funding was only in place for two years, which was \u201cnot sufficient to allow a long-term provision to be built\u201d.\n\nIn a series of recommendations, the report suggested that the Government should effectively reintroduce a previous Labour target requiring all pupils to complete two hours of PE a week, which was axed by the Coalition. It was needed to make sure \u201ckey groups\u201d such as girls and obese children get enough access to exercise, MPs said.\n\nThe report also criticised the controversial decision to scrap the last Government\u2019s School Sports Partnership \u2013 a scheme linking pupils with local sports clubs and coaches \u2013 saying that it had a \u201cnegative impact\u201d on children\u2019s access to coaching.\n\nThe study suggested that a new cut-price version of the programme should be reintroduced.\n\nGraham Stuart, the committee\u2019s Conservative chairman, said the Olympics was a \u201cmagical time\u201d, but added: \u201cThe Government needs to act to ensure that the momentum is not lost amid short-term plans and funding. If school sport is to grow, it needs sustained funding and time to develop.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSuccessive governments have kicked school sport around as a political football, announcing short-term fixes without any sustained vision for the future. Occasional pump-priming is simply not good enough for something so important.\u201d\n\nStephen Twigg, the Shadow Education Secretary, said the Government had \u201cfailed to create a legacy for school sport\u201d.", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03075/rsz_fotolia_projec_3075216g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10192151/ https:/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03186/IAB_Student_Life_4_3186316a.gif", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/Wombat-1-e_3602888g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02762/primary_summary_2762979g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03068/Postgrad_piggy_ban_3068937g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/grandad_3602577g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02460/summaryImageAlev46_2460324g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03098/Richard-Harman_3098947g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03199/15174814041_17ed2f_3199087g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02079/bad-exams_2079369g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03000/Fotolia_Coding_Man_3000733g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03214/CF-140x87_3214162g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03549/scientist-in-lab_3549159g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02402/sportlesson_alamy_2402763b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02460/summaryImages460px_2460321g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01817/Graeme-Paton_60_1817929j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02402/sportlesson_alamy_2402763k.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02402/sportlesson_alamy_2402763k.jpg", "date": "22/07/2013"}, "rank_23": {"title": "Olympic legacy hampered by 'barmy' lack of national strategy, says former London 2012 deputy chairman", "text": "As the anniversary of the London Games approaches, Mills says the country has not done enough to work together to improve the provision of sport.\n\nHe admits he is \"frustrated\" at the lack of progress since London 2012 and says the government needs to take a lead on developing a national strategy.\n\n\"[Sports participation] is not growing as much as we want.

I\u2019m enjoying running and doing what I do, instead of thinking that I have to do something.\u201d\n\nNo longer burdened by the nation\u2019s expectations, he returns to Stratford determined to enjoy every moment of the raucous reception that awaits him from the capacity 60,000 crowd a year after he was roared to victory in the 5,000m to complete his historic double.\n\n\"It would be amazing if they made same noise. It will never be the same again, having the Olympics at that moment, but it will be great if it is close to that. They said the photo finish camera shook with the noise. That showed how loud it was in that race.\u201d\n\nFarah admits it will be emotional to be back in the Olympic Stadium, but above all it will be exciting. \u201cI\u2019ve been back there once since for a photo shoot and it was an empty stadium. You picture things, where you were at that that point and what happened. It will be quite emotional but at the same time it will be great to go back and win.\u201d\n\nWith Greg Rutherford nursing a hamstring injury and Jessica Ennis-Hill still not certain to compete this weekend because of a long-standing ankle problem, the organisers\u2019 best-laid plans to stage a Super Saturday reunion have been thwarted. Fortunately, though, Farah still has vivid recall of the greatest night in the history of British athletics.\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just buzzing. At the same time there was a lot of pressure, but having an Olympics on your doorsteps, coming into the stadium and having people shout your name, was just incredible. It was something I could never imagine.\n\n\u201cI knew Jess had done well and could see her going round and celebrating. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Greg was super-happy too.

At the European Championships in Russia, we won gold and silver in the men\u2019s, with the women reaching more finals than ever. The extra money has allowed us to better support the next generation and we had an outstanding European Youth Olympics.

When the sport avoided being dropped from the Olympic programme, it was more relief than joy. Our inclusion in the Olympic Games is everything.

Since London 2012, we\u2019ve had more than 21,000 new members at the RYA. But from this point on is the important time. We\u2019ve issued a call to arms for our clubs, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t expect the Olympics to have done the job for you\u2019.\u201d\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nSHOOTING\n\nOlympic medal count: 1 (1 gold)\n\nElite funding pre-2012: \u00a32,461,866\n\nElite funding post-2012: \u00a32,992,493\n\nAdult participation pre-2012: 118,000\n\nAdult participation post-2012: 128,300\n\nBritish Shooting chief executive Hamish McInnes: \u201cPeter Wilson\u2019s gold medal gave the sport a huge fillip and what we\u2019re trying to use is Pete\u2019s success and charisma as a springboard to get more people in finals in Rio. We\u2019ve done remarkably well in the shotgun events, with Pete winning a World Cup event along with 15-year-old Amber Hill in skeet.

We undertook a really in-depth review, brought in Michael Phelps\u2019s coach, and there was a lot of soul-searching. We\u2019ve got a new leadership team, we\u2019ve seen some very good swimming ahead of the World Championships and we\u2019ve got some great young stars.

You\u2019re almost in the Andy Murray trap, where there are some really good guys ahead of you.

But our funding increase has enabled us to bring more athletes onto our world-class programme, with our capacity almost doubling from 17 to 32. What we want to do is create more strength in depth, a bit like British Cycling.

Gone, too, are the less lamented giant McDonald\u2019s outlets and the bar selling warm champagne at \u00a330 a bottle. Everywhere are cranes and diggers and hillocks of ballast.\n\nStill there were sufficient landmarks to make the place recognisable: round the velodrome we went, past the media centre, before, after circling the Orbit tower, we ended up in the stadium. And it was at that point that I realised the utter futility of scepticism.\n\nThe stands were about half full of runners\u2019 friends and family, plus many of those who had already completed the route. A good 25,000 people were in there and looking up at them as they waved, clapped and shouted was an invigorating sight.\n\nBut it was the noise that really knocked me back. As we ran in, moments of commentary from last year\u2019s athletics programme boomed out of the public address system, playing on a loop, serving as a greeting for every runner.\n\nJust as I began to circuit the track, the closing moments of Mo Farah\u2019s 10,000-metre victory were replaying all around. I looked at my fellow entrants and realised that every single one of us was grinning.\n\nThe reaction was written there on every face: all of us were, just for a moment, recalling what had happened on Super Saturday and were imagining ourselves to be Mo. It put a spring in the weariest of steps; lifted by a communal surge of adrenalin, there was not a runner there who did not attempt to sprint for the line. Even those who were walking broke into a jog.\n\nIt was astonishing to observe. Like a sort of evangelical prayer meeting, suddenly everyone was infected by the spirit of the place. There was no one involved who would not have deposited in their memory banks the moment they crossed the line of the Olympic Stadium doing the Mobot (and yes, I did).\n\nIt was seeing this reaction that made me realise where the true legacy of the Olympics can be found. Until that point I was not entirely convinced the Games would have much relevant life beyond last summer\u2019s extravaganza. It seemed to me that what we had paid for was a fortnight-long carnival; fun for sure, but not something that was going to effect permanent change.\n\nI thought all Lord Coe\u2019s insistence of a lasting benefit was a smokescreen to justify the vast expenditure: he wanted us to believe there would be something more tangible from spending \u00a39 billion than a shiny new home for West Ham.\n\nBut watching the runners complete the course, telling each other as they lined up for their souvenir goody bag that it was the best thing they had done, it became obvious from where any wider effect of the Games will be derived. It is from the achievement of the British team. That is what drove those runners to arrive in east London at some absurdly early time on a Sunday morning.\n\nThat is what sold out this weekend\u2019s Anniversary Games within an hour of tickets being made available. The opportunity to run where they had run, or to sit in the stadium where they had delivered so much, is what proved inspirational.\n\nHad the same building staged victories solely by Jamaicans, Kenyans and Americans the response would not have been anything like as enthusiastic. It is not bricks and mortar that will haul people off their sofa to participate or watch. It is local success.\n\nThe stadium has particular meaning for us because of what Farah, Jessica Ennis, Greg Rutherford and David Weir did in it. Had we spent last summer simply observing the efforts of Usain Bolt, David Rudisha and Allyson Felix, this weekend\u2019s anniversary event would be half empty.\n\nYou might call it the Murray effect. Every year the All England Club hosts a beautifully staged tournament at Wimbledon. But it is only this year, when Andy Murray won there, that rackets have been dragged from cupboards in quite such profusion.\n\nThere is no way the number of small boys currently thrashing a ball around their local park court would have been out there if Novak Djokovic had won. For events and facilities \u2013 however splendid \u2013 to have any wider resonance they need a meaning, a meaning that comes from winning performance by those who grab the local imagination.\n\nIf on Sunday what I saw in action was the sum total of the Olympic legacy, it will still be a significant thing. What we runners were out there doing, in our limited, wheezing, flabby way, was attempting to emulate what we had seen. It is the memory that inspires. Fortunately for Lord Coe and his extravagant promises of how his Games would change our nation\u2019s emotional and physical landscape, those memories linger powerfully indeed.\n\nIan Botham has turned me off Sky\n\nWatching Sky\u2019s coverage of the Ashes (and I have done little else for the past fortnight) one important question needs to be answered. It is nothing to do with Australian batting failures or the deficiencies of the DRS system.\n\nIt is simply this: how come no one in the production office has told Ian Botham that repeated, stuck-record jokes about David Gower\u2019s butler are about as funny as reading your latest bank statement?\n\nNo expired nag has ever suffered such a thrashing as that administered by the knight of the realm on an observation that was at best passably amusing the first time it was uttered back in 1997.\n\nSo slack-jawed in astonishment have I become at its endless overuse, I have latterly deserted the excellent Michael Atherton and adopted a watching technique my father swore by 40 years ago. I have taken to turning down the television volume and tuning in to Test Match Special.\n\nThe schoolboy burblings of Henry Blofeld, the knowing chuckle of Vic Marks, the shrewd analysis of Jonathan Agnew are like aural balm after Botham and his butler. Indeed, so woefully unfunny is the Botham shtick it makes Phil Tufnell sound like Oscar Wilde. Which, we can all agree, is an unlikely achievement.", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript",

Cup.\n\nMr Johnson said he had instructed his City Hall demographics team to study the birth data after recalling last year telling Olympic medal winners that they had caused such joy in Britain that they had \u201cnot only inspired a generation, [but] probably helped to create one as well\u201d.\n\nHis comments came ahead of the one-year anniversary of the Games this weekend, which will be marked by a series of athletics events in the Olympic Stadium.\n\nUsain Bolt, the current 100 and 200 metres record-holder, has returned to London to take part in the competition and was on Thursday forced to distance himself from the latest doping scandal to engulf sprinting.\n\nBolt said that he is a \u201cclean\u201d athlete and that he had been doing \u201cphenomenal things\u201d since he was 15.\n\nSprinters including American Tyson Gay and Jamaican Asafa Powell, both finalists at London 2012, have recently tested positive for banned substances.\n\nMr Johnson claimed that his statisticians have estimated that the number of births in London in 2013 will be 137,900.\n\nThe Mayor said that there were approximately 135,000 births in 2012 and 134,000 the year before that.\n\n\u201cThat tells us that we\u2019ve got an Olympic baby boom legacy,\u201d he told BBC London radio.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now up to the biggest number since\u2026the year after the World

you\u2019ve not only inspired a generation, you probably helped to create one as well.\n\n\u201cAnd actually, when you look at the demographics of what\u2019s happening in the maternity wards of London it turns out to be broadly true.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson disclosed that a giant snow dome to rival the largest indoor ski resort in the world is to be built next to the Olympic Park.\n\nThe \u00a3200million ski centre will feature several runs of varying difficulty, snowboard ramps and an ice-skating rink.\n\nHugh Robertson, the Sports Minister, said that the full value of hosting the

charge of flags for the Olympic Stadium\u2019s medal ceremonies and was there for every day of the Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nThe only thing I knew about the flags was that, at the front of the teams in the athletes\u2019 parade, one person carried a flag. so I said to them: \u201cI think you\u2019ve got the wrong guy.\u201d Luckily for me they hadn\u2019t.\n\nWe went through a vast amount of training, about 15 days in total.\n\nWe were inundated with health-and-safety talks and the importance of political correctness. But there was nobody there who had ever had anything to do with flags at all.\n\nOur two rehearsals at the stadium were disastrous, really. The flagpoles didn\u2019t work and then there was an emergency re-order of flags because they didn\u2019t fit them.\n\nThere was also a major scare in the last few days when we nearly put the British flag up instead of the German flag.\n\nWe\u2019d gone through all the checks and, unfortunately, one of the checks had been done twice by the same guy, who made the same mistake both times, pulling out the GBR flag instead of the GER flag.\n\nThe flag store was a 15-minute walk from where the ceremonies took place so there was no choice but to delay the presentation.\n\nBut the most memorable moment was the tearful reaction we got when we broke all the rules by handing Mo Farah a Union flag on the last day of competition. He was overwhelmed.\n\nAfter the Games, I was asked to present a paper at a Flag Institute Conference on my experiences at London 2012.\n\nI wrote a report, which I kept as positive as I could \u2013 because it really was a great experience \u2013 but making it clear that a lot of things could have been done much better.\n\nI also wrote to the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee.

As the torrent came down, I was dashing from the Olympic Park to Stratford station when I passed a young man sitting atop a stepladder. He was a volunteer, one of the small army of purple-clad Games Makers on duty across London.\n\nAnd, despite the cascade falling on his head, he showed no inclination to desert his job of directing visitors to the transport links. Soaked to the bone he may have been, but, as I passed, he serenaded me in song through his megaphone. And the tune? He was reprising that great anthem of carefree optimism, he was singing Singin' in the Rain in the rain.\n\nIt was that moment, barely hours into the event, that first made me fully appreciate the Olympic effect. What this cavalcade of running, jumping and \u2013 in the case of many a British gold medallist \u2013 sitting was doing was this: it had given us Brits permission to be enthusiastic.\n\nEverywhere you went the mood was the same, an overwhelming can-do spirit prevailed. There was the volunteer at Custom House DLR station rapping out directions for hours \u2013 days \u2013 on end. There was the middle-aged Games Maker high-fiving everyone who passed her as she picked up litter in Hyde Park. There were thousands of wonderfully helpful people you encountered across our capital, their faces surely aching with all that grinning.\n\nFor once friendliness, civility and good cheer were the dominant moods as London embraced the world. Among the volunteers, among the supporters in the magnificent venues across the city, even on the sofas of the nation, suddenly our collective attitude had swung in an upwards trajectory. No longer were we a bunch whose glass is invariably half-empty. For a glorious few weeks our cup was not just half-full, it was overflowing with positivity.\n\nNot that many were predicting beforehand that this would be the case. In the weeks immediately before it all began, the vibrations on the radio, in the newspapers and on that 140-character shredder of reputation Twitter, insisted that we should prepare ourselves for national humiliation.\n\nThe way it was being told, everything that could go wrong with our hosting of the Games was certain to go wrong. We had outsourced the security operation to cack-handed, greedy incompetents, we had surrendered our civil liberties to the commercial interests of the sponsors, and allowed London\u2019s road network to be thrown into jeopardy in order to accommodate the Ruritanian requirements of officials. Travel agents reported a surge of late bookings as people sought to flee from the anticipated omnishambles.\n\nAs a strategy, however, the escape plan began to unravel from the first beat of the opening ceremony. The moment the lights came up on a stadium transformed into a bucolic paradise, complete with livestock, it became clear that those who had deserted our shores were in the wrong place. Ninety minutes of dazzling theatre, dance, film and music later, the telephone lines must have been thrumming with refuseniks trying to negotiate passage home.\n\nAn innovative, witty mash-up of our cultural history, the opening ceremony spun the head, brought a tear to the eye and made everyone lucky enough to witness it smile hard and long. Danny Boyle\u2019s brief had been to reintroduce Britain and its capital to the world. How successfully he achieved that, presenting his homeland as a modern, friendly and, above all, humorous place. It quickly became clear that London was now the centre of the known universe, the place on which the world's eyes were trained.\n\nThe ceremony was a reminder to the world \u2013 and perhaps, more to the point, to ourselves \u2013 that this country has long held within it a wellspring of joy. It was the most enticing welcome to these isles of wonder.\n\nFor the Mexican journalist sitting next to me in the stadium, the high point of that evening was the Queen\u2019s cameo in a James Bond pastiche. He could not believe it really was her, could not believe the Queen was hitching up her skirt to join in the party. And he was right to be astonished. At that moment, all suggestions of stiff formality were bundled out of the helicopter. What her appearance insisted was that the next fortnight, everyone was invited to participate in the fun; we really were all in it together.\n\nAnd improbable as it may have seemed, from that vertiginous high spot, things just got better. Snapshots of our glorious capital \u2013 of horses apparently leaping over Canary Wharf, of cyclists skirting a sun-dappled Buckingham Palace, of female athletes in micro bikinis playing volleyball on Horse Guards Parade \u2013 spun round the globe. How wonderful it all looked. The facilities were brilliant, the transport smooth, everything just worked.\n\nEven the assumption that corporate ticketing would preclude the ordinary citizen from observing the action at first hand proved unfounded. The opportunity to watch for free was everywhere seized. Tens of thousands filled Hyde Park to witness the Brownlee brothers dominate the triathlon. A million people lined the streets around Hampton Court to see Kilburn\u2019s King of Cool, Bradley Wiggins, win the time trial.\n\nThere is no doubt victories such as these by local competitors added to the overall sense of well-being. Not even in the wilder reaches of Lord Coe\u2019s imagination could such a happy confluence have been envisaged: jaw-dropping facilities, brilliant hosting, and world-beating achievement by the home team.\n\nAnd what was so inspiring about Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, Chris Hoy and the other British champions was that they delivered. There was no failure of nerve, no wilting under the weight of expectation, no hint of the traditional way of British sport of crumbling when faced with a crucial penalty in a shoot-out. For a fortnight, spot kicks were smashed unerringly into the top corner.\n\nThus it was that the Games became awash with an unstoppable benevolent momentum: everyone \u2013 administrators, spectators, volunteers and athletes alike \u2013 quickly recognised they were having the time of their lives. This was an intoxicating daily demonstration of our best side: civic-minded, helpful, properly patriotic, proud of our culture\u2019s sterling qualities. As Mayor Boris Johnson put it, this was \u201ca nation at ease with itself\u201d.\n\nA year on, looking back at that month-long festival of good cheer, however, we are obliged to wonder what the lasting effect of those beguiling few weeks might be. The talk now is of legacy. Messrs Coe and Johnson insist that the Olympic Park \u2013 currently being reconfigured for future public use \u2013 will continue to draw the curious in their thousands. But questions are rightly being asked about future funding: how active those inspired by what they saw can become if their local swimming pool is closing or their PE teacher is being laid off.\n\nTalk of participation targets and bricks and mortar, however, may be missing the fundamental point about what the Olympics gave us. Surely the most significant benefit of the Games is the alteration it brought in our wider sensibility. What the festivities proved to us is that we can do things not just well, but better than anyone else. We can take on the world at anything, from a firework display to a rugby Test match, from a transport network to a tennis grand slam, from the production of motor cars to the Tour de France \u2013 and win.\n\nWe have discovered, moreover, that the best way to enjoy something is to embrace the effort, to immerse ourselves, to volunteer.

A year on, we can rightly take a moment to celebrate our Olympians and Paralympians and all those, like the Games Makers, who made last summer so wonderful.\n\nWe know that it took time, hard work and dedication to pull it off. Queen Elizabeth Park wasn\u2019t built in a day \u2013 it took investment and focus from successive Governments over a decade in grassroots and elite sport to ensure our medal tally.\n\nA year on, the worry is that the Government has failed to keep the flame alive. While David Cameron promised that the Olympics would \u2018inspire a generation\u2019, the evidence on the ground is that the legacy is under threat.\n\nTake school sport. In 2010 Labour had a system in place for ensuring that school pupils got access to at least 2 hours of sport and physical exercise a week. Our \u2018School Sports Partnerships\u2019 allowed schools to work together to share equipment, teachers and playing fields.\n\nBut since David Cameron scrapped it, two thirds of school sport staff report that there has been a decrease in pupils doing sport.\n\nWhen Labour left office, there was a requirement that pupils had access to at least 2 hours of sport. Now teachers say fewer than half of their school children get this amount of PE \u2013 surely a basic minimum.\n\nIt is not for lack of enthusiasm. A majority of young people say they were inspired by the Olympics to do more sport and two in five feel they don\u2019t get enough sport at school.\n\nWe know how important regular sport is not just for staying healthy and finding the Olympic stars of the future, it improves academic results too.\n\nSadly, it\u2019s not just school sport that\u2019s being squeezed. The latest Active People survey found that the number of adults participating in sport once a week has fallen by 200,000.\n\nThat\u2019s why to mark the one year anniversary of the games, Labour is calling for a clear action plan to get the legacy back on track.\n\nThe minimum two hour target for PE in schools should be reinstated, which is supported by 97 per cent of school sport staff.\n\nWe want to ensure that all schools, including academies and free schools have a suitable amount of outdoor space for sport.\n\nWe would improve PE teaching too, ensuring that sports is a high priority in teacher training, and ensuring there is a PE subject coordinator in every primary school and a qualified PE teacher in every secondary school.\n\nIf David Cameron is serious about the legacy, he needs to take real action \u2013 unfortunately, the independent Education Select Committee warned last week that his approach to school sport is little more than a \u201cgimmick\u201d. Instead, we need a 10 year strategy for community and school sport.\n\nThis Government had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to inspire a generation after the success of London 2012. But the sad truth is they are squandering the Olympic legacy.\n\nStephen Twigg is Labour's shadow Education secretarty and Harriet Harman is Labour\u2019s Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03000/Fotolia_Coding_Man_3000733g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02631/Harriet-Harman-twi_2631225b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02282/vet_getty_2282871g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03075/rsz_fotolia_projec_3075216g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02297/eton_2297105g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02296/pendleton-seatedsm_2296627g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03199/15174814041_17ed2f_3199087g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02631/Harriet-Harman-twi_2631225k.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01673/consultant_1673824g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02243/Aviva_school_crick_2243063g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03214/CF-140x87_3214162g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/keep-the-flame-alive/10211921/ https:/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03186/IAB_Student_Life_4_3186316a.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03068/Postgrad_piggy_ban_3068937g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02631/Harriet-Harman-twi_2631225k.jpg", "date": "31/07/2013"}, "rank_116": {"title": "Academic paper says one-third of medals at last four Olympics were won by privately-educated athletes", "text": "The record at Sydney was 32.7 per cent, Athens 26.6 per cent, Beijing 37.7 per cent and London 37.5 per cent.

At assembly they don\u2019t hand out medals to those who have done well in maths, or raise a flag up the pole to celebrate an unblemished attendance record.\n\nThe spirit can instead be found in a somewhat unexpected place, embedded in a series of pots dotted around the playground. Made, decorated and planted with foliage by the pupils, these are pots waiting to be delivered to local old people.\n\nThey were put together by the children in their spare time, as part of a pilot project for Team London, the Mayor of London\u2019s junior volunteering programme that is being rolled out across the capital.\n\n\u201cThe idea came from the Mayor,\u201d says Veronica Wadley, the coordinator of Team London. \u201cHe wanted there to be a real Olympic legacy delivered in volunteering as well as in sporting participation. And the best way to do that is to introduce the idea of volunteering to the next generation of the capital\u2019s citizens.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that the vast army of upbeat Olympic Games Makers, wearing their purple tunics and broad smiles, not only gave the London Games a memorably warm, human dimension, they also altered the wider attitude to giving up your time and energy freely for the community.\n\nWhile it is moot whether the nation was motivated to get off the sofa and put on its running shoes by watching the brilliance of Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah in action, there is no question that the thousands of cheery Olympic and Paralympic volunteers inspired a big spike in coming forward.\n\nLast summer made it fashionable to be helpful, to do your bit for the community. At every major sporting and cultural event in the capital you now encounter volunteers guiding the way, providing information, picking up litter in the same way as their Olympic models.\n\nTo help coordinate that new, widespread enthusiasm, there is now a Team London website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d says Wadley. \u201cIf you want to plant a tree in Camden on Saturday, there is now a place you can go which can tell you how to go about it.\u201d\n\nThe Mayor, though, was keen that the spirit of the Games Maker passed down to the city\u2019s youngest citizens. The idea was that every school in the capital, junior and infant, secondary and primary, was to be involved.\n\nAfter securing funding of \u00a3555,000 to help deliver it, a pilot project was established in a dozen schools last year. One was St Saviour\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe thought the best way forward was for the pupils themselves to decide what they would do,\u201d says Flora Vidal, the senior teaching assistant who was put in charge of organising the school\u2019s approach. \u201cSo we got the school council \u2013 which consists of two children from each of the seven classes \u2013 to discuss what they would like to do.\u201d\n\nThe idea they came up with did not involve changing the school uniform to a purple tunic with red-fringed epaulettes. Rather it was green tinged.\n\nPots were made and planted around the playground. Then, after a couple of months of careful cultivation, they were taken on a surprise trip to a residential home close by.\n\nHere each of the elderly residents was presented with their own pot plant. There were a lot of smiles \u2013 and no few tears \u2013 when children, some as young as four, delivered their specially made gifts to the old people.\n\n\u201cIt was a lovely day,\u201d says Vidal. \u201cThere was a couple in there who happened to be celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary that day. They were so touched to get their two pot plants. They said they couldn\u2019t think of a nicer present.\u201d\n\nBut the really interesting thing about this small act of volunteering was what happened next.\n\n\u201cEverywhere around the school, people started volunteering,\u201d says Vidal. \u201cThey were sharpening pencils, helping with the lunch queue, picking up litter. Now they are busy getting stuff together for children in Syria. A huge parcel is being put together to send there for Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe reason, she is convinced, is that the plant pot idea was theirs in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt came from the school council,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it was not imposed on them by adults, the children really bought into what they were doing. They couldn\u2019t wait for lunchtime so they could get out there watering the plants, or decorating the pots. Children are naturally really helpful anyway, but what this did was make them more aware.\u201d\n\nAnd that awareness has spread well beyond decorating pots.\n\n\u201cFor the first time I can remember, children want to be on the school council. More than half the pupils now want to be on council. It\u2019s made them more confident about coming forward. It has made them more communally minded. They just want to do more. They want to join in, be involved. A couple of parents have said to me their children\u2019s confidence had really been boosted by being on the project.\u201d\n\nThe pupils at St Saviour\u2019s are not unusual. This is often the consequence of volunteering: as those behind institutions such as the Scouts, Guides and Cubs long ago recognised, it has a largely beneficial effect on those who volunteer.\n\n\u201cI think everyone saw through the Olympics that it\u2019s great fun, great social networking, getting together, making friends. Which are all wonderful things in themselves,\u201d says Wadley.\n\n\u201cBut if you integrate volunteering into children\u2019s lives there is something more. Self-esteem, confidence, communication, teamwork all improve. These are soft skills that ultimately lead to an improvement in educational results.\u201d\n\nWadley is convinced that it is this that will ensure every school, no matter how pressed it may be for time and resources, will engage enthusiastically with the idea of volunteering.\n\nAs Marc Kielburger, co-founder of Free the Children, the organisation tasked by Team London to deliver the Mayor\u2019s project across all of the capital\u2019s schools, puts it: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen first-hand that involving students in their communities creates an atmosphere of caring and compassion, and over the years we\u2019ve seen the confidence and social conscience of hundreds of thousands of young people involved in our programmes grow and flourish.\u201d\n\nFree the Children will use young coordinators to encourage the pupils to come up with their own initiatives. No one will be told what to do by Team London. And this is the key. Not only does volunteering make the streets cleaner, the mood lighter and the smiles broader, properly directed it has a practical consequence on those who do it.\n\n\u201cStatistics show the value of volunteering,\u201d says Wadley. \u201cResearch by Reed employment showed that 73 per cent of employers would employ someone with volunteering experience over someone without. What makes you stand out when you go for a university place or a job? It\u2019s not just good GCSEs or A-levels. It\u2019s those soft skills. Put volunteering in your life and it will help you.\u201d\n\nHead to volunteerteam.london.gov.uk to find out how you can get involved.", "images":

and a failure to boost the number of children playing sport, peers warned today.\n\nA wave of public goodwill generated by the London Games has been replaced with political bickering, confusion over timeframes and a lack of clear leadership, it was claimed.\n\nIn a highly-critical report, a cross-party group insisted that many of the promises made after last summer\u2019s event had already been broken, with particular concerns raised over a failure to agree about future use of the \u00a3429 million Olympic stadium.\n\nLengthy legal rows over the stadium between West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur and Leyton Orient football clubs have been a \"disappointing distraction\", the committee said.\n\nPeers also insisted that there had been \u201clittle evidence\u201d of a general post-Games increase in sporting participation, particularly among children.\n\nThe Lords Olympic and Paralympic Legacy Committee called for \u201curgent action\u201d to be taken amid fears a golden opportunity to transform Britain\u2019s sporting habits will be wasted.\n\nPeers said the Government should create a new ministerial post with specific responsibility for the Olympic legacy to coordinate the UK response to the Games, which cost almost \u00a39 billion to stage.\n\nThey also recommended a greater drive on school sport, including additional training for primary teachers to deliver PE amid fears that too many young children are not getting a proper introduction to the subject.\n\nThe conclusions follow the publication of a survey by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in the summer that found a decline in the number of children involved in sport across all age groups over the past year.\n\nLord Harris of Haringey, the Labour peer and committee chairman, said it was clear that the \"Games were an outstanding success, both for the country and for British sporting achievement\".\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been done without incredible cooperation between the numerous organisations involved, the Government and the host borough councils,\" he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, since the Games, the same political impetus and agreed deadlines no longer exist and many aspects of legacy are in danger of faltering, whilst some have fallen by the wayside.\n\n\u201cThere is confusion on the timeframes and targets involved in delivery and a lack of clear ownership of legacy as a whole.\u201d\n\nLord Harris said that the Olympics had promised to \u201cinspire a generation\u201d, but insisted there was \u201clittle evidence that a general post-Games step change in participation across the UK has materialised\u201d.\n\n\"We are calling on the Department for Education and Ofsted to give greater emphasis to PE in schools and to ensure that teachers have the training and skills necessary to carry this through, particularly at primary level,\" he said.\n\n\"At a time when the UK faces an obesity epidemic, encouraging more physically active lives is of critical importance, and school is where lifelong habits will be set.\"\n\nIn further conclusions, the report questioned the Government\u2019s policy of weighting sports funding towards those with the best chance of securing medals, saying the approach \u201cfails to help emerging sports, some of which, such as handball and volleyball, generated real enthusiasm at London 2012\u201d\n\nIt called on the Department for Transport to take \u201cproper ownership\u201d of securing international train services at Stratford station next to the Olympic Park to \u201cgenerate a return on the substantial investment made in the station\u201d.\n\nThe report also said the Government and tourism groups should \u201cwork to ensure that the longer-term economic benefits of the Games are felt outside southern England, where legacy benefits are currently less obvious\u201d.\n\nA Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"The Government remains committed to building on the legacy created from hosting the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to benefit the entire country for generations to come.\n\n\"Our legacy has been hailed by the International Olympic Committee as a 'blueprint' for future Games and over the next 10 years we aim to use the inspiration of 2012 to deliver lasting change in sport, communities, the economy, east London and awareness and perceptions around disability.\"", "images":

"Internationally acclaimed rapper, Tinchy Stryder, has launched the East Village \u2018Artists in Residence\u2019 programme which will celebrate the homes and cultural legacy at the former Athletes\u2019 Village, now London\u2019s newest neighbourhood in E20.\n\nTinchy Stryder has revealed a new track developed with sixth-form performing arts students from the new education campus, Chobham Academy, in East Village. The new school anthem was unveiled last week by a live performance from students with Tinchy Stryder in East Village.\n\nFollowing a visit to East Village earlier this year, which helped Tinchy draw inspiration from the people and surroundings in the new neighbourhood, he surprised the Chobham Academy students by hosting a masterclass to develop new ideas and hone their natural talent. A follow-up visit gave the students the chance to present back to Tinchy before they combined their talents to finish the anthem.\n\nTinchy Stryder, said: \u201cI\u2019m passionate about passing on my musical knowledge to young people and I was proud to be East Village\u2019s first Artist in Residence. Having grown up in Bow, and having been previously asked to develop the Olympic Torch Relay song, it\u2019s an honour to give back a lasting cultural legacy to the area that I grew up in.\u201d\n\nWhat is the East Village Artists in Residence programme?\n\nThe East Village Artist in Residence programme is an important part of the cultural legacy and artists come in to help that grow. I was honoured to be asked to be the first Artist in Residence and also that the anthem created with students at Chobham Academy will speak directly to the kids and be a true legacy.\n\nWhy did you want to get involved with the project?\n\nI\u2019m from Bow, East London, just around the corner from everything going on at the Olympics last year, and helped out with the torch relay song. With the Olympic legacy, if I can be an influence by getting involved in any way then that\u2019s dope.\n\nHow do you think the project will affect the community?\n\nI think it is very positive because it brings more opportunities. It would be nice for the people who have been living here for a while to benefit from the developments and improvements, I know this will happen but I know it will take time.\n\nWhat\u2019s it been like seeing the incredible transformation in the area?\n\nI could never imagine or picture anything like the developments going on today. It feels like a whole different place. It shows how we have progressed, when a lot of stuff you could only imagine a few years ago, comes true. It feels really good.\n\nWhat is it you love about the area and what makes it so unique?\n\nFor me personally it\u2019s the friends and family I have here but when I was younger I guess watching TV, like Eastenders. It feels good now that east London feels like somewhere where people can meet and there\u2019s different places where people can socialise. East London is good; it\u2019s where it\u2019s at. There is something very special about the place.\n\nYou have worked with kids a lot \u2013 what is it you enjoy about the work?\n\nI really enjoy working with younger people, I feel like sometimes when I was younger I didn\u2019t have the opportunity to meet, or speak or get advice from people who you respect or look up to for what they do. I feel like I can say \u201cI\u2019m from where you\u2019re from\u201d and I can show them that it can be done. I like the connection and the bonding, it\u2019s natural, like that feeling in the air, it can\u2019t be replaced.\n\nIf you could give yourself a piece of advice as a kid looking back, what would you say?\n\nI focused on too many different things growing up, I would say to focus on one thing that you love, go with your heart and stick to it. Without the heart there is no you.\n\ngood to put energy together. I think it's really important; it is only going to help them grow.\n\nWhat do you think about Chobham Academy, now you\u2019ve seen it yourself?\n\nI was thinking, why didn\u2019t I have schools like this when I was younger? Everything is high tech and I like it. There's a good vibe, a good energy, especially with the kids and the young ones I was working with today, writing music and lyrics with. It's good energy.\n\nThey all seem really focused and there wasn\u2019t anyone who was just there for the sake of it. They\u2019ve got plans and they\u2019ve got aims and ambitions and hopefully everyone will fulfil that.\n\nTell us about the song you are writing with the kids from Chobham\n\nI wanted to see what the school means to them. They told me what different colours mean to them, about healthy competition and working together. They gave me ideas about the melody and rhyming patterns. So I gave them a few ideas and will be back to see how they get on.\n\nHow important is it for kids to get involved in the arts?\n\nI think it is really important for students to get involved with the world of arts. I believe everyone is artistic in one way or another. If you are in the right surroundings where there are loads of people as creative as you are, or maybe even more, it is\n\nYou wrote the official Olympic Torch Song and performed at the Games; what was that like? How did you get involved?\n\nI did the Olympic torch song with Dionne Bromfield. It was an amazing feeling, as I could never picture myself performing at the Olympics, so it was a very proud moment for me.\n\nLearn more eastvillagelondon.com\n\nAngelica Malin can be found blogging and tweeting @jellymalin", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03075/rsz_fotolia_projec_3075216g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03127/bristol_alamy_3127925g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02631/stirling_alamy_2631969g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/Wombat-1-e_3602888g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03002/alevels1_3002526g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03068/Postgrad_piggy_ban_3068937g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/grandad_3602577g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02677/Angelica_Malin_2677914j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03199/15174814041_17ed2f_3199087g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03404/BSMS_1a_3404428g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02311/level-lads-leaping_2311659g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03000/Fotolia_Coding_Man_3000733g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02799/gcse_2799725g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02766/Tnchy-east-village_2766659b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02500/coventry1_2500804g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03214/CF-140x87_3214162g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02962/christchurchUSE_2962925g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03549/scientist-in-lab_3549159g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02649/GCSE_2649740g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/secondaryeducation/10519906/ https:/secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03186/IAB_Student_Life_4_3186316a.gif", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02340/a-level-exams-pers_2340411g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02681/schools-directory-_2681851g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02766/Tnchy-east-village_2766659a.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02766/Tnchy-east-village_2766659a.jpg", "date": "16/12/2013"}, "rank_119": {"title": "Leyton Orient could share Olympic Stadium with West Ham as Barry Hearn is cleared to strike rental deal", "text": "West Ham United may yet be forced to share the Olympic Stadium with Leyton Orient after Barry Hearn was given permission to use the venue by legacy chiefs.\n\nThe London Legacy Development Corporation confirmed on Wednesday night that it had no objection to Orient chairman Hearn negotiating a rental agreement with whichever firm ends up operating the London 2012 centrepiece, something that could lead to the club playing all of their home games there.\n\nThe revelation followed a meeting between the London Legacy Development Corporation and Hearn, set up in the wake of the House of Lords report last month into the Olympic legacy, which recommended that Orient be allowed \u201coccasional use\u201d of the stadium.\n\nThe LLDC reiterated that there was no prospect of West Ham\u2019s sole anchor tenancy being challenged but told Hearn that there was nothing to stop him striking a deal for Orient to play at the venue when it is not being used by their local rivals.\n\nThe right to manage the stadium during those periods will be put out to tender next year, with Live Nation and AEG likely to be among the \u00adbidders. The winner will be charged by the LLDC with eking the maximum possible revenue out of the arena during a contract expected to span between 10 and 20 years.\n\nThey will not be able to offer Orient a long-term lease such as the 99-year agreement enjoyed by West Ham but look poised to have the power to grant permission for them to play an entire season at the venue, perhaps several.\n\nConfirming the outcome of the meeting last week, Hearn said: \u201cWest Ham won\u2019t want to hear this but the news that came down is they have no problem with me renting the Olympic Stadium and playing my fixtures there. It\u2019s only a question of what rental I agree with the new operators. That\u2019s a major breakthrough for me.\u201d\n\nHearn claimed that the prospect of Orient using the stadium every other weekend would be attractive to whoever manages it because it would provide the kind of regular guaranteed income a music concert or other one-off event could not.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the new stadium operator will agree with that assessment. \u201cThey\u2019ll realise that there is nothing else to go in there during the football season,\u201d Hearn said.\n\nHearn, who has lost every legal challenge to the LLDC\u2019s refusal to sanction a permanent groundshare, had offered previously to pay \u00a3500,000 a year rent, double were Orient promoted from League One.\n\nRevealing that he would ask the new operator to name its price, he said: \u201cIf they ask me for \u00a31 million per game, I\u2019m not going to move in.\n\n\u201cBut, when push comes to shove, to recoup fixed costs \u2013 even partial fixed costs \u2013 it is better than having an empty stadium as far as the taxpayer in \u00adconcerned. If they quote me something ridiculous, I will hang them out to dry, in terms of, \u2018This is a community club and you\u2019re trying to take liberties\u2019.\u201d\n\nHearn\u2019s previous plan was to sell Orient\u2019s present home at Brisbane Road if they moved into the Olympic Stadium but he admitted that would now depend on what length of deal was on the table.\n\nAn LLDC spokesman said: \u201cWe will be appointing an organisation next autumn to manage, maintain and operate the stadium and programme activities and events.\n\n\u201cOnce they are appointed, Leyton Orient are free, as are anyone, to approach the operator to discuss using the stadium.

Taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be paying for Premiership football clubs.\u201d\n\nThe 55-year-old claimed that the conversion costs would come at the expense of other London Legacy Development Corporation projects at Stratford\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe \u00a3154 million has to come from an already stretched LLDC budget and the knock-on effect is that the rest of the transformation of the park \u2013 the really important stuff such as housing \u2013 will suffer as a result.\u201d\n\nThe Olympic Stadium conversion will include retaining London 2012\u2019s athletics track, which will be covered by expensive retractable seating when West Ham play there.\n\nBoff said: \u201cOnly by ditching the requirement for the athletics track are we likely to see more bids from the private sector for a proper football stadium rather than the hybrid fudge we currently have.\u201d\n\nWelcoming Monday\u2019s news, Dennis Hone, LLDC chief executive, said: \u201cThis is another milestone in the development of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. We go into 2014 on track to deliver a world-class venue that, when it fully opens in 2016, can be used year round to host a whole range of sporting, cultural and community events.\n\n\u201cThe stadium will be a truly remarkable legacy here in east London.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02817/oliver-brown_2817670j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02782/Olympics_2782803k.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01377/West-Ham-United-Fo_1377214h.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03202/Ibraauditions_3202090g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02782/Olympics_2782803b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/91952193_LONDON_EN_3589285g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03473/sam-wallace_3473003j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03127/charlie_eccleshare_3127601j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03584/lpool1_3584875g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03193/Youngsters_3193023g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Jason_Burt_2417299j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03587/arsenal1_3587463g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03076/zola-top100_3076216g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03431/harry-redknapp_3431318j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03102/Managers_3102424g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03189/chris-bascombe_3189184j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03618/younge_3618639g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03152/facup1_3152834g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/blood_3589220g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Telegraph_football_3588075g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/DERBIES_3589123g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Cheltenham_300x50_3588742a.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03254/overrated2_3254402g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03187/topp-100-50_3187081g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03523/PLAYING-MANAGERS_3523946g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03218/hardmensplit_3218019g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03220/team_3220787g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03479/zlatan-ibrahimovic_3479216g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03254/undercompo1_3254514g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02782/Olympics_2782803k.jpg", "date": "06/01/2014"}, "rank_83": {"title": "Historic pre-election cross-party manifesto being drawn up by MPs amid fears over Olympic legacy", "text": "The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Sport, chaired by former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe, plans to devise a 10-year strategy for sport which it wants every major political party to include in their own election manifestos next year.\n\nA cross-party consensus over sport is thought to be unprecedented, with such formal pre-election agreements on other areas of policy tending to be reserved for wartime or other national emergencies.\n\nBut those who champion sport inside Westminster have grown increasingly concerned about the extent to which it has fallen down the list of Government priorities since the Olympics and Paralympics and believe the country risks heading for an irreversible decline in physical activity.\n\nThe infighting within the Conservative Party over cuts in school sport funding highlighted how damaging a lack of joined-up thinking could be, while the Prime Minister's last cabinet reshuffle \u2013 in which the highly-rated Hugh Robertson was moved to the Foreign Office \u2013 sent a message that sport would face even more of a fight for attention in future.\n\nSport England's most recent Active People Survey, meanwhile, showed participation in sport in England fell by more than 50,000 between December 2012 and December 2013.\n\nSutcliffe told the Telegraph Sport: \"I don't want to see what's happened in other nations post-Olympics and Paralympics, where the bubble has burst and participation rates drop.\n\n\"We know that elite athletes are funded to 2016 and that the 'whole sport plans' are there until 2017 but we've got to look beyond that. We've got to have a 10-year plan in my view.\"\n\nSutcliffe was confident any cross-party manifesto, which he plans to present to each party at the end of the year, could survive the brutal partisanship of a General Election campaign \u2013 even one as close as 2015's is predicted to be.\n\nHe said: \"There are always competing interests in terms of manifestos. But our aim is to give sufficient time for people to endorse that manifesto.\n\n\"We will have to battle but if we don't have anything ready or don't have a view then it will get lost as different priorities compete for Government support.\"\n\nThe manifesto could include a budget and is likely to highlight how investment in sport can ultimately result in huge savings in other Government departments.\n\nSutcliffe, the Labour MP for Bradford South who was sports minister between 2007-10, added: \"Sport can influence policy areas in other departments, whether that's Health \u2013 in terms of well-being \u2013 Education \u2013 in terms of developing individuals \u2013 and even the Home Office. After all, the busiest place in a prison is the gym.\"\n\nThe all-party group plans to consult as widely as possible for manifesto ideas, including speaking to sports groups within parliament and sports bodies themselves.\n\nBut Sutcliffe said it would also welcome ideas from members of the public, including from readers of the The Telegraph.\n\n\"It's important to develop a scale of interest in this, not only from sports bodies.\n\n\"I think individuals have got a lot to contribute here and so it'd be great to hear what people think are the priorities and where they think the investment should be.\"", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02811/olympicspa_2811288b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03189/ben-rumsby_3189185j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02811/olympicspa_2811288k.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02811/olympicspa_2811288k.jpg", "date": "04/02/2014"}, "rank_126": {"title": "Wapping's hockey revolution bears fruits as London club goes business savvy", "text": "When Stuart Burnside, a Yorkshireman who played hockey for his local factory side, arrived in London a decade ago to work for a top law firm, he was handed a dilemma over where to live.\n\nHe decided on the shortest commute and settled on Wapping, close to his work in Canary Wharf. It then conspired that a work colleague played hockey for Wapping, a club founded in 1988 as part of the Olympic legacy project following Britain men\u2019s glittering gold in Seoul.\n\nTen years later and Burnside is now Wapping Hockey Club\u2019s chairman and admits, when the question is put to him, that there is \u201csomething of a revolution\u201d occurring at the club.\n\nIt\u2019s nothing to do with the club not having a home identity, that their facility is council-owned, or that they use a local bar as their club house. Far from it, the club has just been savvy in garnering commercial and sponsorship deals at every corner and they are reaping the rewards.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Wapping has had limited access to local facilities and they have been pretty dilapidated,\u201d admits Burnside. \u201cAs a result, we had been reticent about taking on new members.\u201d\n\nSo when Burnside came in as chairman earlier this year, he ripped up the previous template. \u201cMy view is that if you have growing participation then you get support in terms of getting facilities. But that\u2019s not to say there are still challenges remaining.\u201d\n\nNumerous talks were held with Tower Hamlets council, with Wapping offering to invest alongside them to improve the facilities, in return for more access.\n\nThis has resulted in the club securing over \u00a3300,000 of investment to designate a local sports centre, the John Orwell, into a hockey priority facility a stone's throw from London Bridge.\n\n\u201cIt means we can put a first-class turf in our home ground,\u201d Burnside says. \u201cCoupled with hopefully getting access to the Olympic legacy facility at Lee Valley, it means we can attract the calibre of players to progress.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Wapping had 196 members. Now they are currently sitting pretty with over 300 signed up and 20 teams. Training nights have also doubled to four per week. \u201cIt is a combination of opening the doors and the Olympic effect which has given us a bump in numbers,\u201d Burnside adds.\n\nBurnside\u2019s business nous has helped in acquiring extra funds. \u201cThe core of any subs is match fees, but Wapping have looked at benefits for extra revenue. There are discounts with local restaurants and online commission fee arrangements.\u201d\n\nWapping have also teamed up with Drambuie, the liquer company, and the deal will help Wapping finance their stadium redevelopment \u2013 with extra floodlights, a modern terrace for spectators - and youth programme.\n\nMoreover, the club have also moved to a local bar, Bar Cape in St Katherine Dock, while a funding injection of \u00a36,000 from its owners allowed them to purchase their own club shirts. Sticks and shirts will adorn the bar walls down the line to give it a club feel.\n\n\u201cWe have an offering which works for both ends of the spectrum in the council,\" Burnside explains. \"We have pricing which is accessible for everyone. On the back of that, the higher earners are now putting money into the scheme as everyone believes in the structure.\n\n\u201cThere are a range of people that we have who are interacting and who are friends as a result of playing sport together. There is no other reason why they would interact, other than sitting on the same tube and not particularly liking each other\u2019s presence. That\u2019s the power of sport, it unifies in a team structure.\u201d\n\nBurnside believes that Wapping can attract players over from more popular sports too. The most recent goalkeeper to join the club has come across from football, though this may have been down to the club deciding to waive subs as they were struggling to attract stoppers.\n\nBurnside now wants to work with 200 local children. His vision is to put satellite clubs and coaches into local schools to nurture the next generation of hockey players in the borough.\n\nCome the 2018 World Cup at Lee Valley, Burnside says, the club's talent will start to be recognised, while he wants his hockey athletes to be part of those England squads in four years' time. It\u2019s a \u201cbig plan\u201d but one Burnside could well pull off.\n\nGo to Wapping Hockey Club for more information on how to join.\n\nFollow The Telegraph's dedicated hockey coverage", "images": ["https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02840/Wapping_Hockey_Lad_2840484a.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02238/CULLENAFP_2238737g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03161/aus_3161318e.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02840/Wapping_Hockey_Lad_2840484b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02840/M1_2840487a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02923/aymar_2923042g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03149/140605-ENG-MAS-16_3149093g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01816/Rod_Gilmour_60_1816161j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03131/aym1_3131285g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02923/charlesworth_2923038e.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03164/summ_3164419g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02923/aymar_2923042e.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02840/The-Cape-new-home-_2840485a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03149/140713--ENG-RSA-W3_3149088g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03128/tom_3128474g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02840/Mens-1s_2840486a.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03227/summ_3227636e.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02840/Wapping_Hockey_Lad_2840484a.jpg", "date": "03/03/2014"}, "rank_49": {"title": "London 2012: More than ever before, we need to get our children active", "text": "It seems barely conceivable that it\u2019s nearly a decade since our bid to bring the Olympic Games to the UK. In the formal presentation, I said that London\u2019s vision is to reach young people all around the world, to connect them with the inspirational power of the Games so that they are inspired to choose sport. I say \u201cis\u201d and not \u201cwas\u201d because this vision is as alive today as it was nine years ago.\n\nWhen we handed the Olympic and Paralympic flames on to the Winter Games in Sochi, I only ever saw it as the first half of Britain\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic journey. Just as it took 10 years to win, plan and deliver our Games, so the next 10 years had to be about capturing everything witnessed in that extraordinary summer of 2012 and converting it into lasting change.\n\nWe\u2019ve made a good start \u2013 but it\u2019s only a start. For example, all eight permanent venues at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park have a secure future and 1.5 million more people are playing sport once a week now than in 2005, including 350,000 more people with a disability or impairment.\n\nBut there remains much to do to deliver the lasting legacy we all want to see. Today\u2019s children are the least active generation in history. They also might be the first generation to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. Clearly that\u2019s not progress \u2013 and physical inactivity may be a bigger culprit than we think. By the age of 15, European children are half as active as they were aged nine. As a nation, we are currently a fifth less active than we were in 1961, and if things don\u2019t change rapidly, we\u2019re on course to be 35 per cent less active by 2030.\n\nThe price we pay is high. Inactive children don\u2019t perform as well in school and are less likely to go to university. As they reach their adult years, they won\u2019t be as happy, healthy or productive as they would be if they had played during childhood. Yes, simply played. All this is why I recently helped launch \u201cMoving more, Living more\u201d \u2013 the Government and Mayor of London\u2019s initiative to promote physical activity.\n\nWorldwide, inactivity is closely linked to more than nine million premature deaths. According to the NHS, inactivity costs Britain nearly \u00a310 billion every year for just five conditions (post-menopausal breast cancer, lower gastrointestinal cancer, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes).\n\nWhat, you may ask, does \u201cmoving\u201d do? Well, Cycling England estimates that a 20 per cent increase in bike riding would save \u00a3246 million in terms of premature deaths, NHS costs, and absenteeism by 2015. These numbers make one thing clear. Our Olympic and Paralympic legacy is about so much more than medals or races won. It is about ensuring those moments, and what we do next, inspire people to participate in sports as a daily priority.\n\nChildren have a right to the benefits that participation in sports and physical activity provide. To unlock this potential it is essential that their first experiences of physical activity \u2013 particularly sporting \u2013 are positive ones. If they are, then there is a better chance that it will become habit-forming. It is crucial that the Government has committed \u00a3150 million a year for three years, ring-fenced, for primary school sport and PE. This has sent a clear message to head teachers that developing high quality PE and sport should be a top priority.\n\nBut this is not just, nor should it be, a government crusade. Influential actors from across all sectors have recognised the importance of this. Last October, the Lawn Tennis Association, British Heart Foundation, Nike, Premier League, Sustrans, and the Young Foundation joined in support of the All-Party Commission on Physical Activity, a group chaired by MPs from across the political spectrum. The commission\u2019s work seeks to provide key recommendations to get children and young people moving more throughout everyday life.\n\nToday, the commission will launch a report of its recommendations based on input from experts and leaders in a wide range of sectors, alongside charities and key governmental bodies. I gave evidence to the commission and welcome its report, which I am sure will merit serious consideration.\n\nNow it is a matter of mobilising everyone to move more themselves to help our children and young people to be active; to ensure our cities and workplaces encourage activity; and for positive experiences of physical activities to be a national priority. If we do this \u2013 move our nation \u2013 we will thrive as a population, as an economy, as healthy neighbourhoods. We should be pushing and challenging young people.\n\nIf we look at global events like the Olympic and Paralympic Games and the Fifa World Cup, it is clear that a select few countries are shaping the world\u2019s perception of sport and physical activity. We are one of them. We have the chance to ensure that the perception is one that inspires the next generation to move. Their future, our future, depends on it.\n\nLord Coe was the chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games", "images":

launch an attack on the Olympic legacy this week, warning that a \u201cdisproportionately high number\u201d of medallists were educated in private schools.\n\nSir Michael Wilshaw will use a major speech to criticise poor standards of PE and claim that millions of state-educated pupils are being failed by the lack of competitive sport.\n\nProper competition remains optional in the vast majority of state schools and only one-in-five pupils regularly play football, rugby, cricket or hockey outside the school day, it is claimed.\n\nSir Michael will call on the Government to do more to enable competitive sport to thrive in the state sector, allowing schools to close the gap between the state and private sectors.\n\nIn a speech, he will say that the best schools use competition to build self-esteem, confidence, a strong ethos and academic excellence, but too many schools allow pupils to opt out.\n\nThe comments come despite a pledge by David Cameron two years ago to put sport at the centre of the school timetable in the wake of the London Olympics.\n\nAccording to figures, well over a third of British medal winners in the 2012 games were from private schools, even though they educate just seven per cent of the population.\n\nThe dominance of private schools was particularly evident in sports such as rowing where more than half of gold medallists were independently-educated.\n\nLord Moynihan, the former chairman of the British Olympic Association, has branded the dominance of private school pupils in sport \u201cwholly unacceptable\u201d.\n\nOfsted has also criticised standards, warning last year that a third of state primaries were failing to provide good PE lessons, with no warm-up sessions, little strenuous exercise and able athletes ignored.\n\nEarlier this month, it emerged that PE lessons would be dramatically toughened up amid fears hundreds of thousands of pupils can barely run, jump, throw or catch.\n\nFor the first time, a generation of specialist PE teachers will be employed directly by state primaries in England to give pupils advanced exercise sessions, healthy living advice and more competitive sport.\n\nBut Ofsted claims that it fails to go far enough and wants a greater emphasis on elite sport.\n\nThis week, Sir Michael will release a major report \u2013 and make a speech \u2013 on the issue.\n\nIt will find that a minority of state schools match the sporting success of the best private institutions, saying that competition creates \u201cculture and identity\u201d and helps pupils \u201cachieve well academically\u201d.\n\nBut the report says many schools provide \u201cfew opportunities to excel in competitive sport because it was not seen as a priority by school leaders, who did not invest in it\u201d.\n\nAccording to Ofsted, schools that shun sport do less well, on average, in terms of overall inspection judgments than those where competition \u201cflourished\u201d.\n\nSir Michael will cite the high number of Team GB medallists at the London Olympics \u2013 42 per cent \u2013 who were educated privately.\n\nSpeaking at a conference at fee-paying Wellington College in Berkshire, he will say that sport \u201cis seen as essential to building self-esteem, confidence, school ethos and academic excellence\u201d in many schools.\n\nHe wants schools \u201cto do more to enable competitive sport to thrive in the state sector so students can reap the wider benefits this brings and increase the proportion of state-educated athletes competing at the elite level at future

I never thought I would come away with two gold medals.\n\n\"To be able to do that in your home ground and have all that support was just fantastic.\n\n\u201cLife has been manic since. It is so nice that I\u2019ve inspired so many people to take up the sport.\n\n\"I still have loads of mail from fans and the profile of our sport has risen so much since the Olympics.\u201d\n\nThe sight of horses strutting their stuff to disco music in Greenwich was, beyond question, one of the unexpected highlights of the Games and it seemed to strike a perfect chord with the British sense of eccentricity and love of animals.\n\n\u201cBefore the Olympics people had no idea what the sport was and now they go \u2018oh yeah, the dancing horses\u2019.\n\n\"The Olympics made a massive difference,\u201d said Dujardin, who was awarded an OBE in the 2013 New Year Honours list.\n\n\u201cThere were people that had no idea, and then they watched it in the pub and they started following it.\u201d\n\nAnyone with a passing interest in the prancing equines would know that Dujardin and four-footed partner Valegro stand on the verge of a historic grand slam.\n\nIf she can add gold in Normandy to her Olympic 2012 win, European 2013 title and her April 2014 World Cup triumph, she will be the reigning champion in all four of the sport\u2019s major events.\n\n\u201cIndividually, a medal here would be fantastic,\u201d she said, perhaps unnecessarily modestly given that she and Valegro will surely be the pair to beat.\n\nThey are not resting on their laurels, winning the World Cup Final in Lyon with a new freestyle routine, set to music from the film How To Train Your Dragon.\n\nSchooling a dressage horse might be slightly less daunting than training a giant fire-breathing lizard, but until that day arrives, Dujardin pointed out: \u201cIt is a huge challenge to be able to get such a big animal to do what we do with it.\n\n\"I remember some people after the Olympics that had no idea about horses would ask: \u2018Do you do that with the horse or does the horse do it by itself?\u2019\n\n\"I think the fact that you can make it look like you are doing nothing is a real talent. And it is such a massive reward at the end of it.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, one note of caution to sound in this tale of British Olympic legacy: a familiar foe lies in wait.\n\n\u201cI would love to win the team event in Normandy but the Germans have got a very strong outfit and I don\u2019t think we can beat them,\u201d she said.\n\nDujardin, with eyes on yet another gold, and Valegro, who has had the carrot of a carrot dangled in front of him, might yet upset the Germans.\n\nAnd what better Olympic legacy could there be than that?", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03010/dujardin_3010191b.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03227/alan-tyers_3227928j.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03010/dujardin_3010191k.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03010/dujardin_3010191k.jpg", "date": "22/08/2014"}, "rank_114": {"title": "Schools must try harder to find Olympic stars of the future \u2013 Ofsted", "text": "Almost three quarters of primary schools are not doing enough to develop Britain\u2019s sports stars of the future despite receiving in injection of extra cash as part of the London 2012 Olympics legacy, Ofsted has warned.\n\nOnly a small minority are also using the \u00a3150 million-a-year fund, intended to bring back the spirit of competition into school sports in England, to help get obese children taking part in physical activity, it found.\n\nOfsted visited a sample of 22 schools already recognised for their sporting initiatives to see how the money from the fund, known as the PE and sport premium for primary schools, was being spent.\n\nWhile all had devoted the extra cash to improving PE, including hiring special coaches and training existing staff in new sports, inspectors found that planning for the money would be used by \u201cgenerally poor\u201d.\n\nThe fund was set up last year with the joint aims of \u201cre-energising\u201d school sport, particularly reviving a focus on competition, and promoting a \u201csporting habit for life\u201d in young people.\n\nOne school visited had recently recruited 60 children and their parents to take part in a local cross-country race, another had more than doubled the number of children participating in outside competitions. Several had paid for specialists to run after-hours boxing, taekwondo, karate and badminton sessions as well as more unlikely ventures such as cheerleading and street dance.\n\nAnd many had identified

guidance on how the new funding should be spent when it was first allocated.\n\n\u201cThis meant that they did not initially feel confident or well prepared to use it effectively.\u201d\n\nThe report adds: \u201cAlthough most of the schools visited were using the premium in effective ways, some common weaknesses were noted.\n\n\u201cStrategic planning was generally poor, monitoring and evaluation of the impact of actions to improve the provision of PE and sports were not rigorous enough.\n\n\u201cA few of the schools had used a small part of the funding to promote pupils\u2019 health and

the amount of PE in schools since coming to power, according to new figures which cast serious doubt on its commitment to an Olympic legacy and to tackling Britain\u2019s obesity crisis.\n\nThe biggest survey of its kind during the Coalition\u2019s 4\u00bd years in office found that the average number of minutes of PE offered to children in England had dropped well below two hours per week, in defiance of promises made to use London 2012 to \u2018Inspire a Generation\u2019 of \u00adyoungsters to become more active.\n\nSeen by Telegraph Sport ahead of its official publication on Wednesday morning, the Youth Sport Trust\u2019s National PE, School Sport and Physical Activity Survey Report also suggested that there had been a major slump in the number of links between schools and community sports clubs since 2010.\n\nBaroness Campbell, chairman of the charity formed in 1995 to support children\u2019s development through sport, described current physical inactivity levels among the young as \u201ca bleak and worrying picture\u201d.\n\nThe YST survey helped to inform its own manifesto for PE and school sport, which is also being launched on Wednesday in an effort to convince whoever wins the General Election in May to develop a joined-up, cross-departmental approach to physical activity.\n\nCampbell also chaired UK Sport for almost a decade, during which the elite funding body bankrolled Britain\u2019s 65 Olympic and 120 Paralympic medals at London 2012.\n\nShe said: \u201cReversing the growing levels of physical inactivity amongst young people is a seismic challenge. With one in three children leaving primary school obese or overweight, and less than one in five meeting the minimum recommended guidelines for physical activity, it is a bleak and worrying picture.\u201d\n\nAccording to the YST survey, which yielded responses from seven per cent of England\u2019s primary schools (1,392) and 12 per cent of secondary schools (554), in the last school year five-to-seven-year-olds spent an average of only 102 minutes per week taking part in PE. That compared to 126 minutes in 2009-10, the final year of the Government\u2019s annual PE and School Sport Survey, which was controversially scrapped when the Coalition took office.\n\nFor children aged seven to 11, the 2009-10 and 2013-14 figures were 127 minutes and 114 minutes, respectively, with a similar drop recorded among those aged 11 to 14. The YST research also found that the average number of links between schools and community sports clubs had almost halved from more than nine to five.\n\nThe charity admitted that it was difficult to compare the 2009-10 and 2013-14 surveys on a like-for-like basis as the Government\u2019s had boasted a 99.8 per cent response rate, participation in it having been mandatory. However, it insisted that its own data was \u201cstatistically reliable\u201d.\n\nIts findings also supported other more limited research conducted since London 2012, during which it emerged that the Department for Education had scrapped a target for state schools to provide two hours a week of PE.\n\nThat was after it also abolished \u00a3162 million of ring-fenced funding for national School Sport Partnerships, the outcry over which prompted a partial about-turn in 2013 and a commitment by the Prime Minister last year to extend a \u00a3150 million-per-year primary school pot until 2020 should the Conservatives remain in office.\n\nHowever, the YST believes more needs to be done to tackle obesity and will launch its manifesto, Unlocking Potential: A Manifesto for PE and School Sport, at the House of Lords this afternoon.\n\nThat manifesto cites figures from recent research which found only 21 per cent of boys and 16 per cent of girls met recommended guidelines for one hour\u2019s moderate exercise per day and that British children born today were on course to be 35 per cent less active by 2035.\n\nThe document calls for every child to receive at least two hours of \u201chigh-quality\u201d PE per week and an additional three of other physical activity.\n\nCampbell said: \u201cOur manifesto demonstrates how PE, school sport and physical activity: improves physical health; boosts mental health and builds resilience; creates active habits for life and boosts academic achievement. We have set out where we believe any future Government should focus its efforts if we are to stand any real chance of reversing the worrying trends that are leading to increasing sedentary lifestyles amongst young people.\u201d\n\nThe YST manifesto is being published in the week the grassroots funding body Sport England launched its \u201cThis Girl Can\u201d campaign to address the disparity in physical activity between the genders.\n\nThe DfE last year commissioned its own survey of 586 primary schools which showed their pupils spent an average of 122 minutes each week doing PE, up 13 minutes on 2013. A DfE spokesman said last night: \u201cAs part of our plan for education, we want children to get into the habit of playing and enjoying sport \u2013 both in lessons and after school. That\u2019s why we are giving primary school headteachers over \u00a3450 million of funding to spend on improving PE \u2013 and our own research shows they are using it to deliver more and better sport.\n\n\u201cOur findings show that primary schools are delivering more than two hours of PE each week, and it has increased by an average of 13 minutes in the last year; 83 per cent of schools also reported an increase in participation in after-hours sports since the introduction of the funding.

According to British Cycling, the gold-medal performances of Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott helped encourage 250,000 more women to start regularly cycling since the 2012 Games. But anyone reading the headlines this week might understandably refuse to join them.\n\nHowever, the tragedy of Ying Tao\u2019s death, and all the other women on London\u2019s roads, do not fit the long-term picture.\n\nOn Thursday, the Department for Transport published its annual road safety statistics. They showed that last year, 113 cyclists died in Britain. This was a touch above the year before, when 109 were killed, but considerably lower than the 134 a decade ago \u2013 and just a fraction of the 1,536 killed in 1934.\n\nThe long-term trend is that cycling deaths are falling.\n\nSo far in 2015, according to the Beyond the Kerb blog which unofficially monitors casualties, there have been 53 fatalities \u2013 which would suggest that, if anything, we may see fewer deaths than usual this year.\n\nThere is, undoubtedly, a specific problem with women cyclists and heavy lorries in London. Most experts suggest that women are more likely to be cautious at junctions and, as a result, be left in a lorry\u2019s blind spot as the vehicle turns left. And London\u2019s construction boom has seen more tipper trucks on the roads, many with poor safety features.\n\nBig, articulated trucks pose a danger to cyclists (Photo: Alamy)\n\n\u2022 Should we ban HGVs from our rush-hour roads?\n\n\u2022 Four outlandish ideas to fix London's cycling problem\n\nBut, overall, women, are less likely to be killed than men. The DfT says that women make up 21 per cent of all the distance travelled in the UK on bicycles, but only 18 per cent of the deaths.\n\nIndeed, as a cyclist \u2013 male or female \u2013 you are less likely to die than at any time since the motorcar was first seen on Britain\u2019s roads.\n\nBut it would be wrong to be complacent, because buried within the official statistics were two very worrying phenomena, which get talked about less frequently.\n\nNamely, that far more deaths occur on rural roads than on urban ones \u2013 despite the London headlines. Secondly, though deaths are falling, serious injuries are increasing \u2013 and increasing at an alarming rate.\n\nIndeed, 3,401 cyclists were seriously injured last year on Britain\u2019s roads, a jump of 8.2 per cent on the year before. This was not a blip. They have increased in nine out of the last 10 years, and are up significantly from 2,174 serious injuries in 2004.\n\nDr Rachel Aldred, senior transport lecturer at the University of Westminster, says: \u201cYes, deaths often rightly hit the headlines. But serious injuries can involve lives being cut short and serious disabilities.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning. Safety in numbers is not naturally following on.\u201d\n\nEd Morrow, at Brake, the road safety charity, says: \u201cThere are more incidents happening where people\u2019s lives are being put at risk. This isn\u2019t just a statistical blip. This is a serious a long-term trend.\u201d\n\nThere was a hope that the sheer weight of cyclists on the roads would force both drivers and local authorities to create a safer environment. But this has not happened.\n\nOne who knows to his cost is John Whiteley, 71, who has been cycling seriously for 55 years \u2013 much of it in the dramatic hills surrounding his Halifax home.\n\nJohn Whiteley, 71, near his Halifax home (Photo: Paul Macnamara/Guzelian)\n\nOn January 2 this year, a clear day, he was out with a friend for a pleasure ride on the B6118, a country road that runs around Huddersfield up to the Emley Moor television aerial. As usual, he was wearing his fluorescent orange vest.\n\n\u201cIt was about midday. And this Volvo estate came up from behind and the corner of his car hit me.\u201d The impact broke his leg, and he went flying into the grass verge, spraining his ankle into the bargain.\n\nWhat did he think? \u201cBloody hell, what a terrible way to start the year.\u201d He has yet to fully recover his mobility, and still feels \u201crusty\u201d.\n\nJohn Whiteley wearing his orange jersey that he was wearing the day he was hit\n\nThere are no conclusive answers why fatalities are falling as a long term trend, and serious injuries are increasing. The obvious answer is that there are more cyclists on the road \u2013 but accidents are increasing at a faster rate than the number of two-wheels. Morrow says: \u201cThe fact it\u2019s going up faster than cycle traffic means we can\u2019t just blame more cyclists on the road. It\u2019s a very complex issue, but there are various factors.\n\n\u201cOur urban road environment is still designed with the car as king. There is money starting to go into cycle infrastructure, but it has been so piecemeal so far.\u201d\n\nOther cyclists suggest that the cuts to road policing mean poor and drunk drivers are not being deterred.\n\n\u2022 Why motorists should thank cyclists for the car\n\n\u2022 Cycle safety: why Chris Boardman is wrong about high-vis jackets\n\nWhiteley himself has his own theory. \u201cHospitals are far better now,\u201d he says. Ten years ago, he was involved in another cycling accident, far more serious than the one that broke his leg. \u201cI was in a really bad way, and if it had happened 15 years before that, I\u2019m not sure I would have survived. But the doctors are so good now.\u201d\n\nOne thing that medicine cannot do, however, is help the disproportionate number of cyclists dying on rural roads. Country roads only account for 32 per cent of cycle traffic, but 58 per cent of all the cycling deaths.\n\nThe main reason is obvious: speed. David Murray, at CTC, the cycling advice group, says: \u201cIf you get hit on a rural road, you are more likely to be hit at speed, and you are more likely to be killed.\u201d\n\nAs rural drivers are less accustomed to sharing the road with cyclists, they can be taken by surprise. \u201cIn London, Bristol and Newcastle, you do expect to see lots of cycling traffic in small confined spaces as part of the traffic mix. As a motorist, you are likely to be aware of cycling and hopefully less likely to cause an incident and accident. In a rural space, motorists are often caught unawares.\n\n\u201cAnd those rural roads are just not good enough. There are very few cycle lanes.\u201d Netherlands is invariably held up as the shining example: high-quality cycling infrastructure can be found both in cities and in the countryside, where separate cycle lanes are common. There, 37 per cent of short journeys (of less than two miles or so) are taken on a bike. In Britain, it is about 3 per cent.\n\nAmsterdam was not always the ideal cycling city\n\nIt is easy to dismiss the Netherlands \u2013 with its endless flat countryside and culture of two wheels, as something we can not replicate. But as Melissa Henry, director at Sustrans, the charity that promotes safer, healthier travelling, says: \u201cIn the Netherlands and other European nations renowned for their bike use, they were pretty much following the same path as us up until the mid-1970s.\u201d Bike use was falling at the same rate as Britain, and car use was increasing. \u201cBut they made a conscious decision to invest more in infrastructure.\u201d\n\nHenry adds that better, and separated, cycle lanes \u2013 both in cities and the countryside \u2013 are crucial to increasing the take-up as well as the safety of cycling in Britain. \u201cThe reason why so many women, children and old people, don\u2019t get on their bikes is that they just don\u2019t feel safe. The perception is the reality. And to change the perception, we have to change the physical environment.\u201d\n\nSegregated cycling lanes in central London. Rarely seen in rural areas\n\nWhiteley\u2019s accident is only one of many that will happen on country roads this year. As he says: \u201cRural roads are many, many times worse than when I started cycling.\u201d\n\nNot only are they busier with cars, they are increasingly full of lorries avoiding congested A-roads: \u201cMotorists used to be so much more considerate. They\u2019d all mostly been cyclists, too. Families used to cycle together back then. They understood what it meant to be a cyclist. People drive faster now, and there\u2019s been a general downturn in manners. People don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, millions more needs to be spent on infrastructure to improve cycle safety \u2013 be it the increase in serious injuries or the deaths on rural roads, or under the wheels of an HGV in a city. But an increase in old-fashioned courtesy might start to make a difference, too.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao1_3355946b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao1_3355946k.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02742/lorry-bike-lane_2742654b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01770/Wallop_60_1770648j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/Cycling_Ying_Tao_3355975b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02532/experts_2532963b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/Cycling_John_White_3355868b.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/Cycling_Whiteley2_3355988b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao2_3355960b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03346/lee-unnamed1_3346168g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02990/female_cyclists_B3_2990652b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02752/cyclist_2752724b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao1_3355946k.jpg", "date": "28/06/2015"}, "rank_170": {"title": "The truth about cycling safety", "text": "Last week, Ying Tao, a 26-year-old Cambridge graduate, recently married and with a great job in the City, was crushed to death under the wheels of a tipper truck.\n\nShe became the eighth cyclist to die on London\u2019s roads since the start of this year.

The DfT says that women make up 21 per cent of all the distance travelled in the UK on bicycles, but only 18 per cent of the deaths.\n\nIndeed, as a cyclist \u2013 male or female \u2013 you are less likely to die than at any time since the motorcar was first seen on Britain\u2019s roads.\n\nBut it would be wrong to be complacent, because buried within the official statistics were two very worrying phenomena, which get talked about less frequently.\n\nNamely, that far more deaths occur on rural roads than on urban ones \u2013 despite the London headlines. Secondly, though deaths are falling, serious injuries are increasing \u2013 and increasing at an alarming rate.\n\nIndeed, 3,401 cyclists were seriously injured last year on Britain\u2019s roads, a jump of 8.2 per cent on the year before. This was not a blip. They have increased in nine out of the last 10 years, and are up significantly from 2,174 serious injuries in 2004.\n\nDr Rachel Aldred, senior transport lecturer at the University of Westminster, says: \u201cYes, deaths often rightly hit the headlines. But serious injuries can involve lives being cut short and serious disabilities.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning. Safety in numbers is not naturally following on.\u201d\n\nEd Morrow, at Brake, the road safety charity, says: \u201cThere are more incidents happening where people\u2019s lives are being put at risk. This isn\u2019t just a statistical blip. This is a serious a long-term trend.\u201d\n\nThere was a hope that the sheer weight of cyclists on the roads would force both drivers and local authorities to create a safer environment. But this has not happened.\n\nOne who knows to his cost is John Whiteley, 71, who has been cycling seriously for 55 years \u2013 much of it in the dramatic hills surrounding his Halifax home.\n\nJohn Whiteley, 71, near his Halifax home (Photo: Paul Macnamara/Guzelian)\n\nOn January 2 this year, a clear day, he was out with a friend for a pleasure ride on the B6118, a country road that runs around Huddersfield up to the Emley Moor television aerial. As usual, he was wearing his fluorescent orange vest.\n\n\u201cIt was about midday. And this Volvo estate came up from behind and the corner of his car hit me.\u201d The impact broke his leg, and he went flying into the grass verge, spraining his ankle into the bargain.\n\nWhat did he think? \u201cBloody hell, what a terrible way to start the year.\u201d He has yet to fully recover his mobility, and still feels \u201crusty\u201d.\n\nJohn Whiteley wearing his orange jersey that he was wearing the day he was hit\n\nThere are no conclusive answers why fatalities are falling as a long term trend, and serious injuries are increasing. The obvious answer is that there are more cyclists on the road \u2013 but accidents are increasing at a faster rate than the number of two-wheels. Morrow says: \u201cThe fact it\u2019s going up faster than cycle traffic means we can\u2019t just blame more cyclists on the road. It\u2019s a very complex issue, but there are various factors.\n\n\u201cOur urban road environment is still designed with the car as king. There is money starting to go into cycle infrastructure, but it has been so piecemeal so far.\u201d\n\nOther cyclists suggest that the cuts to road policing mean poor and drunk drivers are not being deterred.\n\n\u2022 Why motorists should thank cyclists for the car\n\n\u2022 Cycle safety: why Chris Boardman is wrong about high-vis jackets\n\nWhiteley himself has his own theory. \u201cHospitals are far better now,\u201d he says. Ten years ago, he was involved in another cycling accident, far more serious than the one that broke his leg. \u201cI was in a really bad way, and if it had happened 15 years before that, I\u2019m not sure I would have survived. But the doctors are so good now.\u201d\n\nOne thing that medicine cannot do, however, is help the disproportionate number of cyclists dying on rural roads. Country roads only account for 32 per cent of cycle traffic, but 58 per cent of all the cycling deaths.\n\nThe main reason is obvious: speed. David Murray, at CTC, the cycling advice group, says: \u201cIf you get hit on a rural road, you are more likely to be hit at speed, and you are more likely to be killed.\u201d\n\nAs rural drivers are less accustomed to sharing the road with cyclists, they can be taken by surprise. \u201cIn London, Bristol and Newcastle, you do expect to see lots of cycling traffic in small confined spaces as part of the traffic mix. As a motorist, you are likely to be aware of cycling and hopefully less likely to cause an incident and accident. In a rural space, motorists are often caught unawares.\n\n\u201cAnd those rural roads are just not good enough. There are very few cycle lanes.\u201d Netherlands is invariably held up as the shining example: high-quality cycling infrastructure can be found both in cities and in the countryside, where separate cycle lanes are common. There, 37 per cent of short journeys (of less than two miles or so) are taken on a bike. In Britain, it is about 3 per cent.\n\nAmsterdam was not always the ideal cycling city\n\nIt is easy to dismiss the Netherlands \u2013 with its endless flat countryside and culture of two wheels, as something we can not replicate. But as Melissa Henry, director at Sustrans, the charity that promotes safer, healthier travelling, says: \u201cIn the Netherlands and other European nations renowned for their bike use, they were pretty much following the same path as us up until the mid-1970s.\u201d Bike use was falling at the same rate as Britain, and car use was increasing. \u201cBut they made a conscious decision to invest more in infrastructure.\u201d\n\nHenry adds that better, and separated, cycle lanes \u2013 both in cities and the countryside \u2013 are crucial to increasing the take-up as well as the safety of cycling in Britain. \u201cThe reason why so many women, children and old people, don\u2019t get on their bikes is that they just don\u2019t feel safe. The perception is the reality. And to change the perception, we have to change the physical environment.\u201d\n\nSegregated cycling lanes in central London. Rarely seen in rural areas\n\nWhiteley\u2019s accident is only one of many that will happen on country roads this year. As he says: \u201cRural roads are many, many times worse than when I started cycling.\u201d\n\nNot only are they busier with cars, they are increasingly full of lorries avoiding congested A-roads: \u201cMotorists used to be so much more considerate. They\u2019d all mostly been cyclists, too. Families used to cycle together back then. They understood what it meant to be a cyclist. People drive faster now, and there\u2019s been a general downturn in manners. People don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, millions more needs to be spent on infrastructure to improve cycle safety \u2013 be it the increase in serious injuries or the deaths on rural roads, or under the wheels of an HGV in a city. But an increase in old-fashioned courtesy might start to make a difference, too.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao1_3355946b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao1_3355946k.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02742/lorry-bike-lane_2742654b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01770/Wallop_60_1770648j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/Cycling_Ying_Tao_3355975b.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02532/experts_2532963b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/Cycling_John_White_3355868b.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/Cycling_Whiteley2_3355988b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao2_3355960b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03346/lee-unnamed1_3346168g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02990/female_cyclists_B3_2990652b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02752/cyclist_2752724b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03355/CyclingTao1_3355946k.jpg", "date": "28/06/2015"}, "rank_164": {"title": "Letters: There simply isn\u2019t room in west London for Heathrow expansion", "text": "SIR \u2013 While it might be desirable from a commercial point of view to expand Heathrow, from a social perspective it will be a disaster.\n\nThe proponents claim it will create 70,000 new jobs, but where are the employees going to live? Houses in west London and the outer suburbs already cost upwards of \u00a3200,000 and prices are rising. There is very little building land available in these places, without encroaching on the green belt, and immigration has led to a growing number of \u201cbeds in sheds\u201d in areas such as Southall and Slough.\n\nProbably every school within 20 miles of Heathrow is full, with no room for expansion.\n\nTraffic congestion will also increase with concomitant air pollution \u2013 which, in a lot of the London area, already exceeds EU recommended limits.\n\nWith a little foresight, Greenham Common airbase, which was suitable for large jet aircraft, could easily have been connected to the main rail line from London to the West and to the M4. There are other military airfields along this route which should also have been considered as possible sites for a new major civil airport.\n\nAs Britain does not just consist of London, \u201cBoris Island\u201d is too far east to be of any value to the Midlands, the North or the West.\n\nEnid Hope\n\nSlough, Berkshire\n\nSIR \u2013 My company employs about 140 people at offices in Newcastle, Glasgow, London and Hong Kong.

We urge the Government to embrace the findings of the Davies commission and start the project at Heathrow.\n\nMark Thompson\n\nNewcastle upon Tyne\n\nSIR \u2013 As Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, points out, Britain needs a long-term, sensible solution for a competitive airport hub. Neither Heathrow nor Gatwick meets this key objective.\n\nThe Government must set the commission\u2019s report aside and not allow lobbyists to hijack the agenda.\n\nAs Mr Johnson says, the \u201ctruly long- term solution\u201d is a four-runway hub in the Thames Estuary.\n\nJoe Seet\n\nLondon EC1\n\nSIR \u2013 Boris Island is the obvious solution for an international airport for the 21st century.\n\nGet on with it, sell Heathrow for housing and relieve the demand for building land elsewhere.\n\nR G Hopgood\n\nKirby-le-Soken, Essex\n\nPrice of atomic war\n\nPhoto: EPA\n\nSIR \u2013 As a Londoner who survived the Blitz, as well as the V1 and V2 rocket attacks, I well remember the joy with which we greeted the news that Japan had finally surrendered.\n\nAt the age of 11, I gave no thought to the cost: the thousands of innocent Japanese lives sacrificed.\n\nMany times since becoming a father and then a grandfather I have wondered if it was necessary. Why could the Allies not have shown the Japanese the power of these weapons by inviting them to a demonstration \u2013 the obliteration of some small atoll in the Pacific Ocean, for instance?\n\nI\u2019ve always wondered if another approach might not have achieved a more honourable victory.\n\nS T Hedges\n\nCheveley, Cambridgeshire\n\nSIR \u2013 I will never forget the silence between adults the day it was announced that the atomic bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima.\n\nTim Kinross\n\nSelsey, West Sussex\n\nCold callers\n\nSIR \u2013 My landline number is registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), but I receive an average of 35 nuisance calls per month to my mobile phone, not to mention at least three text messages a day.\n\nEach time I block a number, the same message comes from another number.

Where did the gulls in other seaside towns learn their aggressive behaviour?\n\nLorimer Burn\n\nGuildford, Surrey\n\nSunday trading laws\n\nSIR \u2013 It is extremely disappointing that the Government is seeking to make changes to Sunday trading laws, particularly after promising before the election it had no plans to relax them.\n\nDevolving powers to vary opening times to local authorities and elected mayors amounts to deregulation by the back door. It is a recipe for chaos in the retail sector, with each area of the country having different regulatory regimes. That is hardly \u201ccutting red tape\u201d \u2013 a stated aim of this Government.\n\nThe Sunday Trading Act is a valued British compromise that has worked well for more than 20 years. Retailers can trade, customers can shop and staff can work, while Sunday remains a day of communal rest. This allows shop workers to spend time with their families and it respects the views of those who want to keep Sunday special for religious reasons.\n\nRelaxing Sunday trading laws will simply spread the same customer expenditure over a longer period. The trial of abolishing Sunday trading hours during the London Olympics proved to be a flop: small shops lost trade, sales declined overall and staff came under pressure to work longer.\n\nKeeping Sunday special is essential to the fabric of our society. Longer Sunday opening will have a dramatic effect on family life for no economic gain. We urge the public to participate in the Government\u2019s consultation.\n\nJohn Hannett\n\nGeneral Secretary, Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers\n\nRev Dr Malcolm Brown\n\nDirector of Mission and Public Affairs, Church of England\n\nJames Lowman\n\nChief Executive, Association of Convenience Stores\n\nMichael Trend\n\nSpokesman, Keep Sunday Special\n\nImpressive results belie grammar school failings\n\nSIR \u2013 Richard Tuck is wrong to justify the re-introduction of grammar schools by comparing their examination results with those of comprehensives. Grammar schools select on ability and usually enrol the top 35 per cent of the ability range. Comprehensives take the full spectrum of ability.\n\nThe only realistic and fair comparison is between the results of the top 35 per cent of comprehensive students and the performance of all pupils from selective schools. In many areas, this simple comparison destroys the myth of comprehensive school failure and the academic superiority of grammar schools.\n\nI was the headmaster of a comprehensive school where the top third invariably achieved a 100 per cent pass rate, the majority with As or A*s. I find it scandalous that, with such an overwhelming advantage due to the ability of their intake, a majority of selective schools regularly fail to ensure that all of their pupils achieve at least five GCSEs at A*-C.\n\nPaul Strong\n\nClaxby, Lincolnshire\n\nSIR \u2013 I agree with Mr Tuck that, with some exceptions, comprehensive schools have failed. However, I do not agree that grammar schools should be brought back, as this would mean the return of the Eleven Plus and of secondary modern schools \u2013 which were themselves failures, because their pupils were, in effect, rejects.\n\nWe need of a new kind of selective education, without examinations. Why not have a system where every primary school nominates at least 30 per cent of its pupils to proceed to an academic type of school, with the remainder going on to a well resourced technical school, with links to industry?\n\nIvor Arnold\n\nBarry, Glamorgan\n\nThe Olympic legacy should be sports for all\n\nPhoto: Paul Doyle / Alamy\n\nSIR \u2013 Tracey Crouch, the minister for sport, makes some excellent points (\u201cDon\u2019t lose the impetus of London 2012\u201d).\n\nHowever, her nine-week public consultation must start with scrutiny of schools in the state sector and a resolution to offer all young children the opportunity to become more athletic, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe basics of learning to run and hand-eye coordination, coupled with an understanding of how good it feels to be fit and active, are vital if we want children to choose to take part in sport. Otherwise, declining numbers of those engaged in sport will see us become a spectator-based sporting nation rather than a participating one.\n\nThe legacy of the London Olympics should also have seen the minister for sport elevated to an independent Cabinet post rather than sitting within a shared department.\n\nJamie Salmon\n\nCrowthorne, Berkshire\n\nDriverless night trains\n\nSIR \u2013 London\u2019s Underground drivers went on strike last week because they were unhappy with the pay and conditions being offered to extend the service overnight.\n\nWould this not be a good opportunity to extend the use of automatic driverless train technology on the Underground?\n\nLate-night workers and revellers would benefit from a 24-hour service, and the train drivers need not disturb their beauty sleep.\n\nBrendan Barker\n\nManchester\n\nCooperative banking\n\nSIR \u2013 With the wholesale closure of many bank branches in towns all over the country, is it beyond the wit of directors to join forces and run several banks from the same premises?

The park officially reopened in April 2014 after work was done to remove the temporary facilities and change others for public use, and since then has welcomed 11 million visitors. Since the end of the sporting events, the focus has turned to providing jobs and housing, and there are currently two enormous office blocks being built as part of a new district called The International Quarter, which will eventually be home to 4m sq ft of commercial property space.\n\nIt is Kevin Chapman\u2019s job to make sure the new office buildings don\u2019t stand empty. He is the head of offices at Australian development company Lend Lease, which is behind the International Quarter, and says Lend Lease is already in discussions with occupiers about future office space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really good, particularly in the last six months, to see the park coming to life,\u201d he says.\n\nBut critics have suggested that the area was on the up anyway as London expanded outside of its traditional core. Chapman says that it is likely that Stratford would have eventually been regenerated, but that the Olympics \u201cmeant it happened more quickly\u201d.\n\n\u201cUltimately I think it would have

the cheers of 80,000 spectators ringing in her ears, the Somalian 400 metres runner Zamzam Farah was living on the streets of London. Unable to return to her home country because of threats to her life, barely able to speak the language, hungry, cold and terrified, at just 21 years old she was adrift in the capital. This was not the Olympic legacy we had imagined.\n\n\u201cI was so scared,\u201d she says, the tears falling as she remembers the gathering panic of being alone and lost in a foreign city. \u201cSo, so scared.\u201d\n\nFour years on and things are looking altogether brighter. Thanks to the intervention of a small, fleet-footed organisation called the Running Charity, she is now a legal resident in Britain, has a job and a roof over her head. And on Sunday she is joining 36,000 others on the start line of the London Marathon.\n\n\u201cI feel so happy to run again,\u201d she says. \u201cWhatever sport I\u2019m doing I feel happy. If I get a chance to do sport 24/7 I would. It was hard, so hard. But not now, now that I have support from people who are really nice.\u201d\n\nFarah\u2019s extraordinary story began in Mogadishu. Growing up in the war-scarred city, gunfire an ever-present soundtrack, she found comfort and release in sport. She was very good at it, too, joining in neighbourhood games of football. But as she grew into a teenager, she found herself the centre of a local storm. This is a country where growing Islamic fundamentalism insists on restrictive rules for women, which she was challenging every time she kicked a ball.", "images":

It was, Harry said, the most appropriate place he could be. Because it was on that occasion, watching the end of London 2012, that he and his brother had come up with an idea that they felt would provide a tangible, lasting Olympic legacy.\n\n\u201cWe believe our graduates are the future of coaching,\u201d he said in a speech delivered from a podium which had been built roughly where Usain Bolt crossed the line to win the 100 metres in 2012. \u201cWe believe they are not just great coaches, but great mentors and great leaders of their community.\u201d\n\nWatching him speak were some of the 250 young people who have gone through the intensive, year-long apprenticeship programme. People like 18-year-old Alisha Wilson, now working as a full-time swimming coach in Glasgow after graduating in June. Or 19-year-old Muhammed Mumin, who spent a year on Coach Core before heading off to college to study business.

infected.\n\nOwner Lorayne Ahmet said Bimbo had contracted laminitis, a disease similar to thrombosis in humans which can lead to animals being put down.\n\nMs Ahmet said she believed the attack on Bimbo may have been perpetrated as part of a \"gang initiation\".\n\n\"There have been a few stabbings in Eltham of late and I have seen youths messing around with the donkeys,\" she said.\n\n\"I think one of them could have stabbed Bimbo as a gang initiation task.\n\n\"I'd like to get my hands on them, put them in a field and let the general public do what they want with them.\"\n\nThe donkey is one of several owned by Ms Ahmet, whose father Len Thorne ran donkey rides in Blackheath, near Greenwich Park, London, for more than 60 years before he died in 2012.\n\nThe herd had lived for nearly 30 years in a field surrounded by six foot fences.\n\nBut in 2012 they were moved on after then Mayor of London Boris Johnson decided to build the Greenwich Equestrian Centre on the spot as an Olympic legacy.", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/19/TELEMMGLPICT000228117660-small_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg",

chancellor - but may now be remembered as the second to never deliver a Budget. The former Home Secretary was in the Treasury for barely more than six months, the shortest-serving Chancellor since Iain Macleod, who died shortly after taking office in 1970. Mr Javid, who last year ran for the Tory leadership to succeed Theresa May, had his time in Number 11 coloured by tensions with Downing Street, namely Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings. One MP told The Telegraph on Thursday: \u201cA lot of this goes back to Vote Leave. Sajid is seen as one who betrayed him. He was seen as quite Eurosceptic, then came out for Remain.\u201d One an outspoken Eurosceptic, Mr Javid embraced Remain under Mrs May, arguing about the effects of Brexit on business. When he took over as Chancellor on July 24, he focused his energy on stepping up no deal planning and was keen to change the Treasury image away from Philip Hammond\u2019s \u201cBeating heart of Remain\u201d department. However the source said this did not convince the Vote Leave crowd which populated Number 10. \u201cThey still see him as a traitor,\u201d the MP said. \u201cSome of this is payback.\u201d\n\nMr Javid was born in Rochdale. His father, Abdul Ghani-Javid, arrived in the UK in 1961 from Pakistan with a \u00a31 note in his pocket and worked as a bus driver and cotton-mill worker before opening a shop selling clothes made by Javid\u2019s grandmother. Mr Javid was one of five brothers growing up packed into a two-bed flat in Bristol, living above the family shop, which, he has said, became the target of racist attacks. He was the first in his family to go to university, studying economics and politics at Exeter. From there he pursued a career in finance, first at Chase Manhattan Bank, then Deutsche Bank, where he ran credit trading in Asia \u2013 a job that required regular flights to and from Singapore. In 2010, he was elected as an MP, reportedly giving up a rumoured \u00a33 million salary for just under \u00a366,000 a year. His first ministerial job, as Economic Secretary to the Treasury, came in 2012, and his second, as the Treasury\u2019s Financial Secretary, in 2013. Mr Javid\u2019s first Cabinet job was as Culture Secretary in 2014, moving to Business a year later, Housing in 2016 and then Home Secretary in 2018. One Tory MP said Mr Javid \u201crepresents graft, hard work. We need these kind of people inside the party.\u201d From day one as Chancellor, Mr Javid was keen to dispel rumours of rifts with Number 10. He told allies he did not want there to be a \u201ccigarette paper\u201d of distance between him and the Prime Minister. He had known Mr Johnson since the Prime Minister\u2019s days as Mayor of London, working with him on the Olympic legacy while serving as Culture Secretary. The former Chancellor is also close to Mr Johnson\u2019s girlfriend, Carrie Symonds.\n\nMr Javid\u2019s media advisor Sonia Khan was sacked by Dominic Cummings Credit : PA", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/02/13/TELEMMGLPICT000207903604_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3pOXBeCBGRdrcDXdaF1Gb4aAh7PRoGZzwjr__3Pn35w.jpegimwidth=480", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/11/TELEMMGLPICT000226084282_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqTh3H5BemKyhXFKdcxJGxV1FTNNabxLt8zdWE99ykJoY.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/generic/Matt-cartoon-255x206px-small.png", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/03/19/TELEMMGLPICT000228058897_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyY7Bk8zCk9SVRV40gj0ZEvu4kB5J2KWMZtjzikf6IjQ.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Author%20photos/Tom__Harris.png?impolicy=byline-author", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Author%20photos/Tom_Harwood.png?impolicy=byline-author", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/03/19/TELEMMGLPICT000228128593_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/03/19/TELEMMGLPICT000228128551_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LVIJFQ3bxXo/mqdefault_live.jpg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2018/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000134049635_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=160", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/02/13/TELEMMGLPICT000214434113-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/02/13/TELEMMGLPICT000214434113_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpegimwidth=480"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/02/13/TELEMMGLPICT000214434113-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "date": "13/02/2020"}, "rank_125": {"title": "Youth Sport Trust: we must not fail in our London 2012 Olympics legacy", "text": "The Olympic and Paralympic Games are a once in a lifetime event that will get young people excited about sport.\n\nMr Steele said it is vital that schools are able to maintain this momentum and help young people develop sport and exercise as a habit that will keep them healthy and fit for the rest of their lives.\n\nAmid continuing debate over the Olympic legacy, it was revealed that the Department for Education is no longer forcing state schools to provide 120 minutes of PE and sport.

The results showed an especially marked increase in enthusiasm since London hosted the Olympics over the summer.\n\nCycling has enjoyed the biggest benefit. Compared to last year, 200,000 more people in England are cycling at least once a week, bringing the number of regular cyclists in the country to just under two million.\n\nOther Olympic sports have also benefited from London 2012, with a substantial rise in the numbers of people running, swimming and sailing at least once a week.\n\nJennie Price, the chief executive of Sport England, said: \u201cDuring the spring and early summer before the Games started, when there was a lot of pretty disgusting weather, some of the pitch sports and other sports had a lot of things cancelled.\n\n\u201cThis included cycling, whose figures went down, but they got a real boost in the three months around the Games. We\u2019re also seeing some specific Olympic sports that have done really well this time. Sports like swimming, for example, that have struggled in the past have started to increase their numbers.\u201d\n\nThe figures appeared to reverse the trend of recent years in which participation levels have either flatlined or shown only minor increases. Last year, the Government was forced to abandon the previous Labour government\u2019s Olympic legacy target of an extra one million people playing sport three times a week, though the latest figures suggest that retreat might have been overstated.\n\nAccording to Price, the number of people playing sport three times a week is now 7.4 million, compared to 6.1 million when London won the Olympic bid in 2005.\n\nThe one blot on the sporting landscape is the failure to achieve a substantial increase in sports participation among 16 to 25 year-olds, with only a 0.1 per cent rise over the past year.\n\nThe news is better for female sport, with the survey revealing that 500,000 more women are now taking part in sport or visiting the gym compared to last year.\n\nPrice said that, while there was no doubt that London 2012 had created a grassroots \u201cbounce\u201d, Sport England had been working closely with the governing bodies since 2009 to increase participation levels, with funding levels being set accordingly.\n\nLast year, tennis and cricket had their funding cut after failing to meet their participation targets. Tennis has had an increase in numbers this year, though cricket participation has continued to fall.\n\nPrice said: \u201cCricket suffered from the weather. An awful lot of fixtures were cancelled and some teams had to abandon their seasons because their pitches were in such a state after all the rain. The underlying picture for cricket is actually quite strong.\u201d\n\nSport England is due to announce its funding levels for the next four-year cycle this month. Price admitted the challenge would be to translate this year\u2019s increase in participation into long-term growth. \u201cWhen it comes to judging the Olympic legacy, we need to take a long-term view, but this does show that we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02420/farah_2420047b.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02420/farah_2420047k.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02099/Simon-Hart_3_60_2099286j.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02420/farah_2420047k.jpg", "date": "06/12/2012"}, "rank_39": {"title": "Fans recapture the magic of London 2012 Olympics at Anniversary Games", "text": "It all came packaged with the fantastically unappetising title of the Sainsbury\u2019s Anniversary Games 2013 and, instead of athletes hanging desperately on the five rings at the absolute limits of their ambition and performing as if their very lives depended on it, we had a bunch simply enjoying a decent pay day en route to far more significant dates at the World Championships in Moscow next month.\n\nSo what?

For instance, the BBC today produced the results of a survey, suggesting two-thirds of the UK public felt the cost of the Games was worth the money.\n\nWhat? As if they needed a survey to determine that. This night might have saved them the bother of all those polls. Of course, the Olympics were monstrously expensive and the legacy benefits highly debatable but what has never been in dispute is that they provided a taste of incredible theatre that proved wholly addictive.\n\nWhat else could explain the extraordinary scenes here at the Olympic Stadium tonight? People forming vast queues for tickets even though both days and all 130,000 tickets had been sold out for this Diamond League fare in 75 minutes in the spring.\n\nIt was not the athletics factor at play, here; it was the Olympic factor, it was pure nostalgia.\n\nSo it was that they came on this lovely night in their thousands to rekindle the magic. Even the stewards were trying to recapture a touch of the old \u2018Games makers\u2019 bonhomie, letting kids use the megaphones to belt out directions to the punters.\n\nThus, there were the daft souls in their Mo Farah masks, or their Boadicea dresses, waving their \u201cGo GB!\u201d placards and posing, Usain Bolt-lightning style, over panoramas of bulldozers and ugly building sites. It was all slightly surreal, this attempt to recapture the spirit of 2012 amid the wasteland of 2013, but nobody seemed to mind one hoot.\n\nThe organisers did their best to recall the fun of 2012 but their choice of the woeful Colin Murray as an early master of ceremonies did not help. Did we really hear him try to get laughs by saying the identikit athlete would have \u201cthe stamina of Mo, the speed of Bolt and the bottom of Jess Ennis?\u201d\n\nGood grief. Truly pathetic.\n\nOnce inside the stadium, how the athletes must have savoured the night, though. The mind flashed back to that first Friday of the Olympic track programme when 80,000 were all neatly in place, ready to raise the roof for Ennis at 9am, a morning when every journeyman had his day and was cheered to the echo.\n\nYou felt for Sally Peake, a Welsh pole vaulter of no great pedigree who must suddenly have felt like Yelena Isinbayeva for a night.\n\nWhen she cleared four metres, the sort of occurrence which might have engendered a brief round of applause and a bark from one man and his dog at a league meet for Birchfield Harriers, it was greeted with a roar which must have made her feel she had just struck Olympic gold.\n\nInternational athletics bosses were sitting here, doubtless purring. Look at the sort of crowds the best athletes in the world attract at their other Diamond League meets. Not bad but no way could they sustain two days of extraordinary interest like this.\n\nHow the International Association of Athletics Federations must rub its hands in absolute glee at the prospect of being able to thin out the programme over two days yet still have 80,000 sell-outs.\n\nAthletics comes over as a sport on the ropes, struggling desperately in the face of major doping scandals which just gnaw away relentlessly at its credibility.\n\nYet here was a night to forget all that and just savour the sight of the man who has sailed through all the controversy and keeps declaring to everyone: \u201cI was made to inspire people and made to run. I was given a gift and that\u2019s what I do. I am clean.\u201d\n\nYes, another night to remember just what Usain Bolt means to athletics.\n\nThey wheeled him out on a motorised spaceship before the action got under way just for the crowd to be able to pay homage. For years, old rocket man has been doing this, carrying the sport on his back like Atlas, not just athletics\u2019 main draw but its main hope.\n\nNow, as he acknowledged his disciples while making his lap of honour, you could not help wondering if he is the sport\u2019s last hope too.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/blood_3589220g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03589/91952193_LONDON_EN_3589285g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/Steve_James_2417426j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01803/IanChadband_60_1803689j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03587/arsenal1_3587463g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03218/hardmensplit_3218019g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02417/James_Corrigan_2417395j.PNG", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03220/team_3220787g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03082/jonny-liew60_3082382j.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03189/chris-bascombe_3189184j.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02628/stadium1_2628721k.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03588/Telegraph_football_3588075g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03584/lpool1_3584875g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03187/topp-100-50_3187081g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03202/Ibraauditions_3202090g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02628/stadium1_2628721b.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02628/stadium1_2628721k.jpg", "date": "26/07/2013"}, "rank_89": {"title": "Sebastian Coe\u2019s going for gold again \u2013 \u00a32 million to be precise", "text": "Sebastian Coe wears his hard hat at a jaunty angle. He seems relaxed, as befits the man who masterminded the London Olympic Games . Compared with years of tours with builders he undertook as the 560-acre Olympic Park took shape, a look around a rather more modest project, covering only three-and-a-half acres, can hardly be taxing.\n\nYet he takes charge within minutes of arriving at the building on Euston Road, just along from the British Library in north London. When it is finished in 2015, it will house the Francis Crick Institute, Europe\u2019s largest centre for biomedical research, where scientists will tackle Britain\u2019s four biggest killers: cancer, neuro-degenerative illnesses, cardiovascular conditions and infectious diseases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to criticise your ducting,\u201d he joshes with the construction manager, as we don high-vis jackets before going inside. \u201cI had my own boots and a hard hat with my name on at the Olympic Park, so I know exactly what to do.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later, he interrupts as the manager is talking us through a scale model of the building. \u201cOn time and on budget!\u201d he chants, drumming his knuckles on the glass cabinet around the model.\n\nLord Coe has already had three careers. First, he was a champion Olympic double gold medallist, then a politician and, latterly, he worked 19-hour days chairing the London Organising Committee for the Olympics, wresting the 2012 Games from Paris\u2019s grasp and then staging them to worldwide acclaim. In his time off, he is father to four children, three of whom are teenagers. The latest addition to the family, a lurcher called George, is 11 weeks old.\n\nSince the Olympic closing ceremony, he has taken on even more roles, chairing the British Olympic Association, advising the Prime Minister on the legacy of the Olympics, and serving as a trustee for half a dozen charities.\n\nNow he is ready for yet another challenge, running the Sebastian Coe Charitable Foundation, which launches officially today. The fund aims to raise \u00a32 million for the Crick building, among other projects, and I am joining him for his first tour.\n\nWasn\u2019t he tempted to put his feet up instead? \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever do that,\u201d he bridles, as we descend to one of the Crick\u2019s four basement levels in a rudimentary metal lift. \u201cWhy would I want to? As long as I find the world an interesting place I\u2019ll wake up and do things I like doing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all talked about the Olympic legacy. So what\u2019s my personal commitment? I thought this was somewhere I could actually make a difference.\u201d\n\nNamed after Sir Francis Crick, the physicist who co-discovered the structure of DNA with the biologist James Watson, the institute is being built on the site of a former goods yard for St Pancras Station, which was heavily bombed in the Second World War and finally demolished in the Sixties.\n\nThe \u00a3650 million project is a partnership between Cancer Research UK, the Wellcome Trust, the Medical Research Council, University College London, King\u2019s College and Imperial College. Around 1,500 scientists will be based in a \u201ccentre of excellence\u201d, with computer scientists, mathematicians and engineers working alongside biologists, chemists and physicists.\n\nIt will replace separate laboratories researching the biggest killers, with the best scientific minds working alongside each other instead. By pooling their talents, the researchers hope to discover treatments and cures faster.\n\nThe building\u2019s outer shell has taken shape rapidly and some of its terracotta stonework is now visible, blending in with the red brick fa\u00e7ade of St Pancras. Inside, however, it is empty, aside from a few boilers. In fact, Cancer Research UK must still raise millions of pounds to build the laboratories.\n\nLord Coe has a personal motive for helping with fundraising. His mother, Angela, died from the degenerative brain disease known as progressive supranuclear palsy, or PSP, in 2005 (the disease that killed Dudley Moore). Only 10,000 people in Britain are thought to suffer from the disease, which slowly destroys nerve endings in the brain. Sufferers produce a surfeit of tau, a brain protein, which becomes tangled and damages nerve cells.\n\nLittle is known about what causes the disease. It is rarely passed down in families, but sufferers are thought to have a genetic disposition that makes them more susceptible. Other researchers have suggested it could be caused by environmental factors, including an unidentified poison that affects brain and nerve cells.\n\nLord Coe first noticed something was wrong in 1996, when his mother, a Rada\u2011trained actress, seemed less energetic than usual on a visit to Cornwall. But she was not diagnosed with PSP for another five years.\n\n\u201cAt first you think, 'Is this just the ageing process?\u2019 We all slow down at different rates. Then we thought she\u2019d had a minor stroke. She started to lose her balance and then her eyesight started to fade, so we went to ophthalmologists and optometrists.\u201d It was not until 2001, after a string of neurological tests, that doctors connected the different symptoms and diagnosed her.\n\n\u201cThis is the most frustrating thing for PSP sufferers,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to get somebody who says, 'I\u2019m seeing the big picture here: your eyesight is failing, and you\u2019re having problems with your balance and swallowing because of the onset of this disease.\u2019 \u201d\n\nPSP, which generally begins to affect people at 62, is incurable, and there was little doctors could do to prevent Angela\u2019s condition from worsening. \u201cIt is an unspeakably horrible disease,\u201d says Lord Coe. \u201cShe was very active in her early seventies and would regularly beat her grandchildren at football in the garden. Suddenly, she started to slow down. My mother read voraciously and would have five books on the go at any one time, but she was trapped in a body that just did not do anything.\n\n\u201cShe was mentally all there, but by the end she couldn\u2019t read, couldn\u2019t speak and could barely swallow her food. My dad [Peter, Coe\u2019s former running coach] described it as watching somebody die millimetre by millimetre.\u201d\n\nAngela bravely allowed the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London to study her degeneration. \u201cShe knew that it was not going to come to her rescue, but she often went in there for two or three days, to allow them to understand a little bit more about it,\u201d says Lord Coe.\n\nHis mother died at the age of 75, just a few weeks before Britain was awarded the 2012 Games. Her drive to find out more about the disease inspires his support of the Crick. \u201cShe would have been fascinated by this place. I\u2019m naturally cautious about talking about cures. But if we could get to the point where it was manageable, I would love that.\u201d\n\nHe becomes even more enthused as we walk around the cavernous fourth floor of the building, where the laboratories will be located. \u201cAs a sprinter, all my training was interdisciplinary. I had physiologists, anatomists and nutritionists who were all working to get me to run quicker. So I\u2019ve always felt that big breakthroughs come about when people talk to others about their own areas of interest.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got people understanding, for example, the nature of hepatitis as an illness, they can help with cancer because it is one of the leading reasons for liver cancer. These people will nominally be focusing on different pathologies, but all working together.\u201d\n\nWe climb the fire escape stairs back to ground level and I leave Coe talking to the builders as they clock off for the day. \u201cWhen it opens, they will get the biggest buzz,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI have only been here for an hour but I get the same excitement I got talking to the builders on the Olympic Park. They are not just creating a building. This place can make history.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the Sebastian Coe Charitable Foundation, visit sebcoe.co.uk/foundation", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02700/sebastian-coe_2700989b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/grandad_3602577g.jpg", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02700/sebastian-coe_2700989a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03071/Ebola__Texas_healt_3071015g.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03349/spoon-x-ray-2_potd_3349715g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03549/scientist-in-lab_3549159g.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03163/happiness-elderly-_3163688g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03091/Caerphilly_health__3091084g.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03602/Wombat-1-e_3602888g.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02547/PD57246758_jm_trai_2547683a.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01412/Rapeseed_1412998g.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02700/sebastian-coe_2700989a.jpg", "date": "13/10/2013"}, "rank_7": {"title": "Olympic Park legacy starting to fulfil its huge expectations", "text": "It may be three years since the Thomas Heatherwick-designed cauldron was lit by seven young athletes in front of 80,000 dignitaries and spectators and thousands more athletes to mark the start of 17 amazing days of sporting achievement, but the Olympic legacy lives on in east London.\n\nAside from this weekend\u2019s Anniversary Games \u2013 timed to coincide with tomorrow\u2019s anniversary of the London 2012 opening ceremony \u2013 memories of the Games continue.\n\nAs well as delivering a celebration of sport, a key pledge of those who brought the Olympics to London was that they would be a catalyst for regeneration in the Stratford area and beyond.\n\nThree years on, is it too soon to judge whether the social and financial legacy of the London 2012 Olympics will be a lasting one? Or have the seeds of revival been sown? And how has the capital fared compared to other former hosts?\n\nLegacy is often judged on the reuse of the landmark stadia \u2013 the most fundamentally unsustainable asset within the whole of an Olympic Park \u2013 according to Nigel Hugill, the executive chairman of developer Urban & Civic.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the proposition that the least regenerative asset in an Olympic Park is the stadium,\u201d he says.\n\nNot so in London. Premier League football club West Ham is moving in \u2013 albeit with dedicated funds from Government and a significant capital investment from the club itself, which will also pay an annual usage fee for the duration of its lease. The club\u2019s commercial activities will be run from there and players will train on the pitch as well as play all home games from the start of the 2016-17 season.\n\n\n\nWhat West Ham's new stadium will look like\n\nThe redesigned venue will also host music concerts and house small businesses, as well as some Rugby World Cup matches this autumn.\n\nSome of the other, small arena assets are also being reused. The Copper Box Arena which hosted handball, parts of the modern pentathlon and goalball in 2012 has attracted more than 60,000 visitors since it reopened in July 2013 as home to the London Lions basketball team and others. The London Aquatics Centre has received more than 1m visitors since it opened in April 2014 with more than 2,000 local schoolchildren accessing it through school swimming sessions every week.\n\nHugill says one of the reasons the assets are still under considerable use is because the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) played to a social need.\n\nIn the lengthy build-up to the Games the promise of reasonably priced homes for Londoners was a key part of the delivery strategy.\n\nAs the price of the average London home passes the \u00a3500,000 mark, according to recent figures from Nationwide, the former Athletes\u2019 Village and now a sprawling housing scheme, is filling up.\n\nThe whole site \u2013 accounting for nearly 3,000 homes \u2013 was bought by Qatari Diar, the oil-rich state\u2019s investment arm, and UK property developer Delancey Estates for \u00a3557m.\n\nNow known as East Village, the development site contains a mix of social accommodation, \u201caffordable\u201d housing where residents are paying around 80pc to 90pc of the market rate to live there, and normally priced homes.\n\nFor Neil Young, the chief executive of Get Living London, it was important to get the balance right between using the Olympic brand and putting some distance between it and everyday life.\n\n\u201cWhen we first marketed the village we wanted to create a new place and new community without always looking to the past \u2013 although we are very proud of the Olympics and buyers are still genuinely excited by it.\u201d\n\nPlaques are going up across the site to show where athletes such as Usain Bolt or Jessica Ennis-Hill stayed.\n\n\u201cBut more importantly we can see that the village is serving its local population,\u201d Young says. \u201cHalf of our residents lived within a London postcode and within that number, half were from east London.\u201d East Village along with all the other, smaller schemes, spread across the Olympic Park should bring 11,000 homes to London.\n\nThe Olympic legacy is not simply judged on sporting culture and housing need alone, however. Office and commercial space is the third piece of the jigsaw to create a vibrant Stratford.\n\n\n\nAerial view of the Olympic site in East London\n\n\u201cWe are now bringing an office workforce to Stratford which it has not had so far,\u201d said Kevin Chapman, head of commercial property at Lendlease.\n\nThe developer has planning consent for 4m sq ft of commercial buildings, of which 25pc is already pre-let to the Financial Conduct Authority and Transport for London. But a school of thought exists that suggests that the Olympic legacy will only be deemed a success because of the regeneration of Stratford that predated it.\n\n\u201cThere is a myth that the Olympics in itself is extremely regenerative of an area \u2013 a myth that is picked up by those people who want to see the Games hosted in a certain area,\u201d says Hugill.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s compare the relatives. Montreal has only just paid off its debts. Athens was palpably not regenerative and the Sydney Games was held in an out of town suburb and had little impact.\u201d\n\nThe two examples that are held up as legacy successes are London and Barcelona, he adds, but in both instances regeneration around the site was already well under way.\n\n\u201cThe notion that the Westfield shopping centre, already planned before London was awarded the Olympics, would not have been built otherwise is clearly ridiculous,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nWestfield shopping centre, Stratford\n\nBut it seems that what the Olympics does do, on occasion, and in the right place, is reinforce the regenerative process if it is already in full swing.\n\n\u201cIn London it accelerated private initiatives and turned them into political imperatives,\u201d says Hugill. \u201cI tried to persuade [the energy company] EDF and the National Grid to bury pylons in Lower Lea Marshes in order to clear the Westfield Stratford site for building. I had little success until after the Olympics was won and the contract was awarded to bury the pylons.\u201d\n\nIn his view the long-term impact of the Olympics is not as strong as it is from a project such as Crossrail, which will fundamentally change more people\u2019s lives on a daily basis \u2013 but there are softer effects. \u201cWhat is the price you are prepared to pay to make the country feel good about itself?\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the 2012 legacy success is the money committed by the Government, private businesses such as West Ham, developers and overseas investors. In fact, London is not the beneficiary of the regenerative powers of the Olympics \u2013 the Olympic legacy will be seen as a success because the Games were held in London.", "images": ["https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02061/east-london-4_2061212b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01956/athletes_1956772b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02234/olympic-park-aeria_2234091b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02119/strat2_2119559b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03048/West-Ham-stand-at-_3048283b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02290/Flame_2290177b.jpg", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02234/olympic-park-aeria_2234091k.jpg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif", "https://secure-uk.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=uk-101665h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03171/Section_ad_11470_-_3171000e.jpg", "http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imp.gif?client=ca-telegraph_uk_420x200&event=noscript", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035736&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02057/Anna-White_60_2057102j.jpg"], "top_image": "https://secure.i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02234/olympic-park-aeria_2234091k.jpg", "date": "25/07/2015"}}
