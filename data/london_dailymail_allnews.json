It is the perfect antidote to the couch potato culture.\n\n\n\n'The pools are there, now we need to make sure they are world-class facilities and that people use them.'\n\n\n\nInitially, it is hoped that local authorities will use a \u00a3130million fund to provide free sessions to all those aged under 16 or over 60.\n\n\n\nThe hope is that all age groups will eventually benefit, but the final decision will rest with councils.\n\n\n\n'My ambition is that by 2012 as many areas as possible open their public pools for free,' said Mr Burnham.\n\n\n\n'This is the first step on that journey. What a fantastic Olympic legacy that would leave.'\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister called for a 'revolution in our sporting culture' to promote the 'engagement of the whole country in sport'.\n\n\n\nBut Don Foster, the Liberal Democrats' culture, media and sport spokesman, predicted that the Government would fail to meet its target for getting two million more adults into sport by 2012.\n\n\n\n'We've lost an incredible amount of time waiting for these plans,' he said.\n\n\n\nThe IOC yesterday approved the relocation of the fencing, handball, basketball and cycling events.\n\n\n\nThe changes are intended to avoid creating expensive 'white elephants' which are left padlocked and decaying after 2012.\n\n\n\nThere is increasing concern over the cost of the Olympics, which has surged from \u00a33.4billion to \u00a39.3billion, amid fears that a \u00a32.7billion emergency fund is being rapidly eaten into.\n\n\n\nBut organisers denied that the changes to venues were made on cost grounds.\n\n\n\n'We only want to build what can be used to maximum effect after the Games,' said Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 organising committee.\n\n\n\nThe legacy action plan will also see a shake-up of the way funding is distributed to sports in Britain.\n\n\n\nCuts to red tape will save \u00a320million over the next three years which will be diverted to tackling the post-16 drop-off in participation as youngsters leave school.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

'glory'", "text": "Abandoned, derelict, covered in graffiti and rubbish: What is left of Athens' \u00a39billion Olympic 'glory'\n\n\n\nThe security guards were furious.\n\n\n\nRushing out from under the shade of an olive tree - one of the few natural things remaining in an urban wasteland surrounded by steel fences topped with razor wire - the two uniformed guards made it clear that attempts to glimpse Helliniko, one of Greece's Olympic 'glories', were strictly forbidden.\n\n'You are not allowed here!' one guard barked, as a car crammed with more security men, summoned by radio, screeched to a halt in front of me.\n\n'These Olympics are closed. For ever!\n\n'Olympic glories': Gipsies now live in a tent in front of the beach volley venue at the Faliron complex in Athens\n\n\n\n'You must not stay here. Go! Now! It's illegal! 'Everything here is illegal!'\n\n'Criminal' might be a better word.\n\n\n\nForlorn: This once proud pool is now dry\n\n\n\nFour years after an outpouring of national delight, when the Olympic Games returned to their spiritual home in the shadow of the Acropolis, the security men were trying to hide evidence of the most scandalous abuse of public money in Olympic history.\n\n\n\nAfter the guards had gone, I ducked through a gap in the venue's fence.\n\nThe reason for their agitation became painfully clear.\n\nIf waste was an Olympic sport, Greece should be world champions.\n\nInside, beneath rusting floodlights, lay devastation - formerly glorious Olympic stadiums were now derelict, covered in graffiti.\n\nThis is where more than \u00a39 billion was spent to bring the 2004 Games 'home'.\n\n\n\nI picked my way through the detritus - empty beer cans, food wrappers and other rubbish.\n\nIn 2004, the sound of thousands of cheering fans from around the world filled the huge space.\n\nNow there's an eerie silence, broken only by the sound of tattered EU flags flapping in the wind.\n\nIt was not supposed to be like this. The benefits of the Athens Olympics were meant to last for generations.\n\nThe Olympic 'legacy' - the favourite buzzword of London's Olympic planners - was meant to be visible to all, transforming the chaotic Greek capital as if Apollo, the god of harmony and civilisation, had smiled on it.\n\nThat has not happened.\n\nDerelict: Graffiti covers a stadium at the Faliron site\n\n\n\nA staggering 21 out of 22 venues lie abandoned since an event lasting just three weeks was held, and the magnificent stadiums are now over-run with rubbish and weeds.\n\nBut the most striking 'legacy' has been the huge sums spent - and wasted - on venues to hold sports with little following in Greece.\n\nAnd yet the madness does not end there: annual 'maintenance' of the empty sites has cost almost \u00a3500million since the event.\n\nFour years on, the Greek authorities unconvincingly insist they are still involved in 'active negotiations' to find buyers.\n\nFor planners of the London 2012 Olympics, it is a cautionary tale. The fear is that London may repeat the mistakes of Athens.\n\nWhen the British capital was awarded the Games in 2005, we were promised they would regenerate the East End, one of the country's most economically-deprived areas.\n\nBut as the projected cost of the London Olympics spirals out of control, these vows are looking decidedly hollow.\n\nMany experts now claim the only beneficiary of 2012 will be big business.\n\nMeanwhile, they argue, the area's poorer communities, whose opinions have largely been ignored, will be trampled upon and left with little more than deserted, rubbish-strewn stadiums.\n\nUnless urgent action is taken to return the focus to the people the Games are supposed to help long-term, London could be faced with its own Greek tragedy.\n\nAbandoned: The walkway to the main Heliniko Olympic complex is choked with rubbish four years after it hosted the games\n\n\n\nBack in Athens, the scene at Helliniko, on the outskirts, is all that remains of a clumsy desire to spur interest in obscure sports such as kayaking, handball and baseball among football-mad Greeks.\n\nNone took off - even when officials tried to generate interest by using the baseball stadium for football.\n\nThey soon discovered the triangular pitches of the American sport were not suited to a game played on rectangular grass fields.\n\nAfter trying to encourage locals to use the facilities, the Athens authorities appear to have given up.\n\nA once stunning bridge across the motorway to take thousands from the yachting complex to the baseball stadium, has been closed, the stairs piled high with waste concrete from nearby building sites.\n\nSpiralling walkways, constructed to allow wheelchair users to travel between venues, are barricaded, their lights smashed.\n\nInside, plastic bags and bottles move through empty boulevards.\n\nIn parks designed to allow families to play, benches have been toppled and the paths are barred by guards.\n\nThree miles north, in the Faliron complex - for the tae kwon do competitions (it's a martial art, in case you were wondering) and beach volleyball - gipsy squatter camps have sprung up.\n\nTents have been erected on grounds that, before the Olympics, were playing fields for children.\n\n\n\nAnd rubbish is everywhere. Fountains are broken and rusting. Pools of water form from broken drains.\n\nAt the Olympic Village, six miles from the city centre - where 72,000 invited dignitaries, including Tony and Cherie Blair and former U.S. President George Bush Snr and his wife Barbara, watched the spectacular opening ceremony - the scale of the extravagance is also a sight to behold.\n\nWhile concerts and football matches have been held here since 2004, the magnificent new stadium is in a sorry state.\n\nApart from a group of security guards, just a few athletes were training inside the pool.\n\nNothing else moved, except rubbish in the wind.\n\nA 20,000-seat tennis stadium lies empty. So does the cycling stadium. And the Olympic diving area. And the hockey facilities. The list goes on.\n\nThese empty stadiums represent a nation so caught up in the desire to prove it was 'modern' that the true cost of such Olympian vanity was overlooked.\n\nIndeed, many of these now decrepit facilities were completed just days before the opening ceremony.\n\nIt seems the thirst of Greek politicians for glory by association - backed by billions of pounds in European funding (your money and mine) - over-rode antiquated notions, such as whether this was value for money and how it would improve the lives of Greeks in the future.\n\nCash was spent with abandon, and the price is still being paid.\n\nWhile the country's budget has plunged into the red by more than six per cent - some say the borrowing costs of the event have reached \u00a335 billion - the Olympic legacy dominates political life in Athens.\n\n'We didn't find a plan for the post-Olympics development of the venues,' says Fani Palli-Petralia, a New Democracy politician.\n\n'When a city gets the Games, it should make a business plan for big changes and then decide what the country needs for the day after the Olympics. This did not happen.'\n\nWhen Britain's 2012 bid was chosen - with London's bid beating Paris - commentators and politicians rightly applauded the fact that Britain would stage these ancient Games for the third time in the country's history.\n\nIt was a chance to show Britain at its best, building what politicians pledged would be a legacy lasting many years after the final race.\n\nAmid predictions that London would be transformed, Tony Blair hailed the victory as a 'momentous' day for the capital.\n\nLike Athens, London has been dogged by traffic gridlock for years.\n\nThere were claims the International Olympic Committee would demand improvements to the capital's public transport system, ending misery for millions, and encouraging tourists.\n\nYet, four years before the first starting pistol has been fired for London 2012, there are echoes of Athens.\n\nWhile Athenians complain they were shunted from their homes to make way for Olympic developments in deprived areas - with soaring property prices and rising rents forcing others out after the events - similar complaints emanate throughout East London.\n\nIndeed, experts predict London 2012 is doomed to fail.\n\n'The Games have been presented by the Government and the Olympic delivery bodies as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help regenerate one of the UK's most economically disadvantaged areas,' says the New Economics Foundation.\n\nBut, the think-tank adds, it seems that big business will be the main beneficiaries, with little money trickling down to poor communities.\n\nLondon 2012 may be going in the same direction as previous Games in its failure to live up to regeneration promises.\n\nWhile much of the funding for the Athens Games came from Brussels, the London Olympics will be funded primarily by the British taxpayer, with a smaller proportion from private business.\n\nIndeed, fears have recently been voiced that the \u00a39.3billion budget has already spiralled to four times the original estimate.\n\nEarlier this month, aware of the perils underscored by the Athens scandal - not to mention the Millennium Dome fiasco and the year-long delays in building a new Wembley football stadium - the organisers of the London Olympics changed the venue for some sporting events.\n\n'Minority interest' sports such as fencing, table tennis and wheelchair basketball will now be played at the existing ExCel centre in London's Docklands, while sports such as handball will share space at the planned 12,000-seat basketball stadium.\n\nIn addition, an 80,000-seat stadium for the Olympics will be dismantled and reduced to a capacity of 25,000.\n\nLord Coe, the former Olympic athlete and chairman of London 2012, explained: 'We have always said that our intention was to build truly sustainable venues which will provide a strong elite and community legacy for sport for generations to come, long after the final race has been run in 2012.\n\n'These small changes to our temporary venue locations. . . are designed to maximise the sporting legacy we leave behind, as well as to optimise the experience for athletes and spectators.\n\n'We want to build only what can be used to maximum effect after the Games.'\n\nBack in Athens not all has been lost.\n\nAs a sweetener for joining the EU, more than \u00a320billion was pumped into creating the city's metro system.\n\nAir conditioned and gloriously efficient, gridlock and pollution have been cut.\n\nIn London, by contrast, ' enhancements' to Tube lines - many given the green light, including the East London line extension - is all that is planned to coincide with the 2012 Games.\n\nWhile there are also much-lauded ideas to introduce high-speed Olympic 'Javelin' trains, making journeys from St Pancras to East London in just six minutes, these will operate only for the three weeks of the Olympics, before chaos reigns again on the roads.\n\nOnly time will tell whether our own planners can avoid the lessons of Athens' Greek tragedy of empty stadiums we are all still paying for.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

countdown to London 2012 begins as thousands celebrate handover of Olympic flag to Britain", "text": "The countdown to London 2012 begins as thousands celebrate handover of Olympic flag to Britain\n\nBritain's final medal tally: Gold, 19; Silver, 13; Bronze, 15\n\nOlympic flag is handed over to London Mayor Boris Johnson\n\n\n\nThousands of Britons celebrated today as London officially took the reins of the Olympics from Beijing.\n\nAs the 2008 Games finished in a spectacular display of fireworks, music, colour and technology, Team GB basked in the glory of its most successful Olympics for 100 years.\n\nAfter winning 19 gold medals, 13 silver and 15 bronze medals, British athletes joined in the closing ceremony, in which Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Olympic flag from his Beijing counterpart.\n\nAfter the national anthem sung by the National Youth Theatre, and the official handover, London's chance to impress the world began.\n\nBillions of people around the world watched the capital's special eight-minute segment which offered a preview of what sports fans can expect in 2012, while across the UK flags were raised and celebrations were held to honour the occasion.\n\nHandover moment: X-Factor singer Leona Lewis performs in front of a 90,000-strong crowd\n\nWorld Icon: David Beckham, Britain's most famous world celebrity, celebrates the handover at the Bird's Nest statium\n\nA London bus with 2012 written on the front toured the Bird's Nest stadium - symbolising the fact that the Olympics are coming to the capital.\n\nA ten-year-old girl then got off the bus and accepted a football as a gift. In a ceremony to symbolise London culture, she walked over a fake zebra-crossing and back onto the bus which opened up.\n\nThe 90,000-strong crowd gasped as the bus converted into the London skyline and X-Factor Leona Lewis emerged singing. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page also started playing in the background.\n\nThen the moment the Chinese and many watchers across the world had been waiting for came - David Beckham appeared on the bus waving and smiling.\n\nThe world-famous icon, roared on by the Beijing crowd, lifted a football above his head and kicked it into the crowd.\n\nThe Mayor of London promised to fly the Olympic flag outside City Hall when he brings it home from China.\n\nSymbolic: A London bus tours the Bird's Nest stadium\n\nAll change: London mayor Boris Johnson waves the flag as Britain becomes the official hosts for the Games\n\nIOC President, Jacques Rogge, presented the flag to Mr Johnson in front of a capacity crowd of 91,000 people at the national stadium in Beijing and an estimated television audience of more than a billion viewers.\n\nBoris Johnson received the flag - but not without living up to his 'bumbling' reputation.\n\nMr Johnson spent what seemed like an eternity trying to unwrap the wield flag from the pole.\n\n\n\nMuch to the relief of Olympic organisers, the blonde Tory politician finally shook the flag free and then waved with a somewhat sheepish smile on his face.\n\nThe Mayor waved the flag four times, as directed, before handing it to an usher.\n\nHe will bring the flag back to London on Tuesday and fly it outside City Hall alongside the Paralympic flag when those Games have concluded in September.\n\nMr Johnson will also display the flag at a major celebration in Beijing tonight for athletes, organisers, senior politicians including Prime Minister Gordon Brown, spectators and the media.\n\nHe said: 'I'm profoundly humbled by the immense privilege I've been given today.\n\nLondon celebrations: Around 40,000 people gathered for the handover celebration concert at The Mall\n\n'I'm also intensely proud. Proud of the athletes who pulled in the best medal tally for decades. Proud of the people behind them who've delivered this stunning success. And proud beyond all that London is now in charge of the Olympic legacy.\n\n'The next Summer Games return to a country which I frequently boast has either invented or codified just about every major world sport.\n\n'We will draw on that heritage and we will draw on our wit, flair, imagination and ingenuity to build on what we've all witnessed in Beijing and deliver a fantabulous Olympics in what I consider to be not only my home, but the home of sport. Sport is coming home. See you in London!'\n\nFlag bearer: Cyclist and triple gold medal winner Chris Hoy flies the Union Flag\n\nSerious: Prime Minister Gordon Brown looks serious as his wife Sarah makes a point\n\nChris Hoy, the Great Britain flag bearer for the closing ceremony, who won three gold medals.\n\nThe 32-year-old from Edinburgh said: 'It is a huge honour to be carrying the flag at the closing ceremony.\n\n\"When you consider the standard of the team it is a very special honour for me.'\n\nBack in London, 40,000 fans gathered for a concert at the The Mall in London to celebrate Britain becoming the new hosts.\n\nKelly Adcock, from Essex, said: 'It was absolutely fantastic - very good. I'm really excited about the Olympics coming to London. I can't wait.'\n\nFriend Sharon Moore said: 'They're a bit cheeky having all those umbrellas - it doesn't rain all the time!'\n\n'It must have been an honour for Leona Lewis to do that. A few years ago she was an X Factor winner, and now she's singing for the Olympics.'\n\nJulie Rawson, also from Essex, said: \"It was really amazing. I feel quite privileged to be here. It's quite exciting.\"\n\nThere was some disappointment as hundreds of people were shut out of the event despite having tickets.\n\nMari Hamilton, from Aylesbury, said: 'They said there were too many people in there. We were supposed to be part of the party.\n\n'There's people being excluded from a party for 40,000 people.\n\n'If they can't fit 40,000 people in why did they issue that many tickets?'\n\nThis afternoon the focus switched to London as a huge party was held in The Mall, where thousands of revellers gathered outside Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe flag-waving crowds enjoyed performances by acts including McFly, Will Young, Katherine Jenkins and the cast of Queen musical We Will Rock You.\n\n\n\nTeen star: British diver Tom Daley, 14, looks relaxed during the closing ceremony\n\nSpectacular: The impressive human display gets underway\n\nGiant screens were set up around the country \u2013 including one in Trafalgar Square, where thousands are expected to join in the celebrations.\n\n\n\nOn the sporting side, Britain's best Olympics for a century ended with Team GB taking home an impressive collection of medals.\n\nWhen the sporting battles finished at Beijing, the final standings placed Team GB in fourth position behind China, USA and Russia.\n\nBritons won 19 gold medals, 13 silver and 15 bronze to make an overall total of 47.\n\nThe last British competitor in the Games was runner Dan Robinson, who came 24th in the marathon in a time of two hours 16 minutes 14 seconds.\n\nRobinson, 33, of Nailsworth, Gloucestershire, said: 'I'm a little disappointed not to make the top 20, but you can only do what you can.'\n\nWheel of joy: A performer wheels around the ceremony to leave the crowd delighted\n\nFireworks: The sky is lit up for the closing ceremony\n\nHowever, the spectacular games have ended on a sour note for many thousands of fans who expected to gather at Heathrow's Terminal 5 to greet the athletes off a British Airways flight from Beijing tomorrow afternoon.\n\nBA and the British Airports Authority, which operates Heathrow, said there would be no public reception because a large crowd could threaten health and safety in the terminal building. BAA.\n\nInstead, Team GB will pose for photographers on leaving the plane before being taken to the airport's VIP suite and the medals winners will attend a press conference.\n\n\n\n", "images":

"text": "Boris Johnson promises 'tens of millions' to realise 2012 vision of a British Olympic legacy in 2012\n\n\n\nMayor pledges to spend millions on true sporting legacy\n\nMoney for coaches and mentors in bid to inspire children\n\nBoris Johnson today promised 'tens of millions of pounds' will be spent on coaching young people to create a true Olympic legacy.\n\n\n\nSpeaking before he flew home from Beijing after Britain\u2019s most successful Games, the Mayor outlined his vision to help the stars of the future.\n\n\n\nHe said London 2012 would see even more Team GB success if young Londoners were inspired to take up a sport and dedicate themselves to it.\n\n\n\nDedication: Boris Johnson. The London mayor said he wanted the 2012 Games to inspire a new generation of Londoners\n\nMr Johnson added: 'We are totally dedicated to it. I want to ring-fence London Development Agency money for sport and that means not just investing in facilities but also investing in the mentoring and the tuition that are so important for long-term success.\n\n\n\n'You can have the facilities but if you don\u2019t invest in the people to train and give people encouragement, it\u2019s not going to work. Sporting opportunity can be part of an early intervention strategy that tackles child poverty and under-achievement.\n\n'I hope a new generation of London children will be enthused, inspired and get involved in sport in a way that they\u2019re not now. I want there to be a massive sporting legacy.'\n\n\n\nThe money will be spent on providing coaching, mentoring and training facilities for grassroots sports organisations. It will primarily be focused on smallscale projects which are already operating successfully and could be expanded across the capital.\n\n\n\nLondon mayor Boris Johnson waves the Olympic flag at the handover ceremony in Beijing\n\nMr Johnson will work in partnership with councils to pay for projects as diverse as resurfacing tennis courts, transporting children to their nearest swimming pool, expanding martial arts clubs in community centres and building new sporting facilities.\n\n\n\nAsked whether the LDA investment for sport would be worth tens of millions of pounds, the Mayor replied: 'Of course'.\n\n\n\nThe overall budget for the LDA - the organisation which aims to boost business and jobs in the city - for the coming year is \u00a3528 million.\n\n\n\nThe LDA has already started getting more young people into sport with its Summer of Sports programme which offers more than 600 free events across the capital with training provided by the official sporting bodies. Investment in facilities is also under way. The Government has pledged \u00a3520 million, \u00a3300 million from the lottery and \u00a3220 million from the taxpayer, for sport for 2012 - twice the amount invested in the run-up to the Beijing Games.\n\n\n\nThe Mayor was flying home today with the Olympic flag and members of Team GB, including gold medallist Christine Ohuruogu who said: 'I'm looking forward to going home and to my own bed, I'm absolutely knackered.'\n\n\n\nMr Johnson admitted feeling excited, saying: 'Do you think I should kiss the ground? It's going to be great and I'm totally amazed how I ended up in this role but it makes me feel incredibly proud.'\n\n\n\nMr Johnson said the success of Beijing had a 'big role' in persuading critics of the Olympics at home that they would be a good thing for the capital. However, he accepted there would be 'ups and downs' in the run-up to 2012 as the Games became the hot political issue.\n\n\n\n'Over the next four years you're going to see a roller-coaster. The Beijing Games has educated and generated huge enthusiasm in Britain but it has also partially educated lots of people about lots of the issues so there's going to be lots more political awareness of disputes,' he warned.\n\n\n\n'Olympic subjects are going to be moving up the political agenda and there will be an awful lot of sound and fury about this or that over the next four years.'\n\n\n\nThe Mayor insisted the Tories would be '100 per cent behind' the Olympics should they win the next general election.\n\n\n\nTeam GB: British Olympic gold medal winners Rebbeca Adlington, Ben Ainslie and Chris Hoy arrive home from Beijing\n\nHe denied there could be problems if Tory leader David Cameron tried to 'muscle in' on the preparations and take personal control. 'I think we'll be fine. On the muscling in front, let's cross that bridge when we come to it. If you look at the way it's already working on the Olympic Board, it's pretty good, there's a very large measure of co-operation.'\n\n\n\nMr Johnson said he would like to keep Olympics minister Tessa Jowell involved if she lost her job at the next election.\n\n\n\n'I certainly think it would be a shame to lose her commitment and her expertise entirely but we'd have to think of some solution there,' he said.\n\n\n\nThe Mayor, who has claimed he would not be 'intimidated' by the scale and expense of the Beijing Games, said he was 'absolutely determined' to keep within budget. However, he accepted that London did not have the spending power of the Chinese capital.\n\n'There was a wonderful moment in the middle of the closing ceremony when Seb Coe turned to me after about five fireworks had gone off and said that's half our budget gone,' he said.\n\n\n\nAlthough Beijing has been praised for its spectacular venues and impressive logistics, Mr Johnson singled out the spectator experience for criticism. Visitors have also commented on the lack of carnival spirit - something which London is expected to excel at.\n\n\n\nLondon 2012: The Red Arrows fly past the Olympic handover celebrations in London\n\n'It's been eye-opening. I'm convinced from this that we can do a Games that is just as good, in our own way, if not better,' he said. 'I don't think you need to go above \u00a39.3 billion to produce a fantastic, memorable and spectacular Games.' Mr Johnson said his trip to China had persuaded him that 2012 would have to be an Olympics for the whole country - not just the capital.\n\n\n\n'One thing we are going to be working hard to do over the next few years is to get across the message that this isn't just London's Games, these are Britain's Games, and I feel that very strongly,' he said.\n\n\n\n'Team GB comes from all over the place and they've done the most amazing job in Beijing. This is about everybody in the country. I want the Games to be a moment where the nation comes together.' However, while the benefits to China of hosting the Games have been obvious - it has been described as the most successful PR operation in the country's history - Mr Johnson struggled to define how the UK as a whole would benefit from London 2012.\n\n\n\nThe benefits to the capital were more obvious - a 'fantastic' celebration of sport, the accompanying sporting legacy and the regeneration of the East End.\n\n\n\nThe Mayor has previously criticised Olympics chiefs for failing to come up with a legacy master plan for the site while business groups have been concerned at the lack of leadership of the project. In response, he announced that a legacy advisory board, comprised of experts, the boroughs and local people, would be set up next month to help drive the regeneration plans forward.\n\nThe handover from Beijing to London as host city was celebrated by thousands who gathered in The Mall for a concert featuring medal winners including American Michael Phelps and Londoner Bradley Wiggins.\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson speaking at London House in Beijing\n\nTHE MAYOR ON...\n\nOLYMPIC CAR LANES 'There is an issue with Olympic lanes [for athletes and dignitaries] and Transport for London have been here in Beijing looking at what they've done. Our job is to put on a fantastic Games and to get people from A to B without delay.\n\nDon't forget that I'm standing for re-election, or might be standing for re-election, in the run-up to the Olympic Games. You can't paralyse the streets of London and we're not going to.'\n\nSPECTATORS 'Although it's been a fantastic Games, it's been quite difficult to work out what's going on where. I think we can do better. There's an awful lot we can do with hand-held devices. You can actually go into the London Games in 2012 and have stuff telling you what's going on where.'\n\nREGENERATION 'I've no doubt that one of the reasons the [International Olympic Committee] gave us the Games was because they saw that at the East End of this fantastic city there was a crying need for investment and a site that has been neglected for decades will be transformed. It will benefit a large part of east London and will help to reorientate the city.'\n\nBEIJING HIGHLIGHTS 'You've got to say, an Olympics where someone breaks the record for the 100 metres, the 200 metres and the relay - that's an extraordinary Games. But the thing I saw that made me want to weep most - the lump in the throat stuff - was [gold medal winner] Christine Ohuruogu because this is a girl from London who is running 400 metres faster than anybody else. And it's open to any place on earth to provide facilities to run 400 metres and yet we did it in London. I thought that was unbelievable.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

and West Ham bid for new homes as 2012 venues up for grabs", "text": "Spurs and West Ham bid for new homes as 2012 venues up for grabs\n\n\n\nLondon 2012 chiefs were plunged into a battle over the legacy of the two key Olympic venues.\n\n\n\nThey are facing a crisis after it emerged that the \u00a3525million Olympic stadium may be demolished to build a new venue for a Premier League football club - with Tottenham widely-touted as an interested party.\n\n\n\nThe end of the Lane? Spurs could move into a new purpose-built stadium after London 2012\n\nMeanwhile, the future of the \u00a31billion athletes' village was put into further doubt by the resignation of two key figures from its developer Lend Lease.\n\n\n\nEmergency plans for a purpose-built football stadium in the Olympic Park are being drawn up amid concerns that the venue will otherwise become a white elephant.\n\n\n\nThe London Development Agency may ditch the original plan to convert the 80,000-capacity stadium to an athletics venue holding 25,000 people.\n\n\n\nPlanners for Mayor Boris Johnson believe it could be cheaper in the long run to build a new stadium in partnership with a football club rather than subsidise its use as a predominantly athletics venue.\n\n\n\nThat could pave the way for West Ham who are sceptical about moving to a former Parcelforce depot site suggested by the LDA.\n\nOr could the Hammers walk away from Upton Park?\n\nWest Ham's initial talks with 2012 chiefs about a move to the Olympic stadium broke down two years ago over disagreement about the cost of converting the venue after the Games.\n\n\n\nTottenham Hotspur currently plan to redevelop their own White Hart Lane stadium to boost capacity but sources say they would not rule out a move to Stratford if the price was right.\n\n\n\nMr Johnson is become increasingly concerned that no 'anchor tenant' has come forward to occupy the venue.\n\n\n\nResponsibility for making it pay its way has been given to Tom Russell, the LDA director of Olympic legacy, and the man who was a key figure in the building of Manchester City's Eastlands stadium when he was at Manchester City Council.\n\n\n\nThe issue will be the first major matter dealt with by Johnson's legacy advisory board which is to be launched later this month.\n\n\n\nProgress on the \u00a31billion athletes' village was plunged into further doubt this week when Nigel Hugill announced he was resigning as chairman of Lend Lease.\n\n\n\nDevelopment director Robin Butler is also going. The troubled Australian firm has struggled to raise its \u00a3450 million stake in the project with a deal not expected until later this year.\n\n\n\nHowever, the planners are not looking to change the existing design for the 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium, and have also been told that whatever is there afterwards must have the capability to stage major athletics events.\n\n\n\nAn LDA spokesperson said: 'The LDA has left no stone unturned in examining all legacy options for the Olympic venues and is still looking at a range of potential sporting uses including athletics, football and rugby for the Olympic stadium.'\n\nMr Johnson's Olympics watchdog David Ross has warned that the 2012 stadium's cost now is \u00a3525million and there would have to be significant private investment into building a completely new stadium after the Games.\n\n\n\nLondon 2012 chiefs have also insisted that having an athletics facility after the Games is non-negotiable because that was one of the promises made to the IOC in the bid.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

"Ministers vow to raise the bar so schoolchildren do five hours of sport a week before 2012 Olympics", "text": "Ministers vow to raise the bar so schoolchildren do five hours of sport a week before 2012 Olympics\n\n\n\nAnnual figures show 90 per cent now do at least two hours a week - an increase of four million since 2002\n\nBut Ministers vow to raise the bar so children perform five hours of sport a week - two hours at school and three hours outside lessons\n\n\n\n375,000 more pupils playing competitive sport against other schools than last year - and 500,000 more playing school house and league matches\n\n\n\nThe Government has vowed to ensure every school pupil takes part in five hours of sport a week before the 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe aim is to increase the current quota of two hours a week to five by 2011, with at least two hours being performed in school and three hours outside lessons.\n\n\n\nNews of the ambitious target comes following today's announcement that four million more schoolchildren are taking part in at least two hours of sport a week compared to six years ago.\n\nGovernment figures show that 90 per cent of schoolchildren now do at least two hours of hight quality sport a week\n\n\n\n'Massive progress': Children's Secretary Ed Balls\n\n\n\nThe 25 per cent jump since 2002 means 90 per cent of children are now performing two hours of high quality sport a week.\n\nAnd since last year alone 250,000 extra young people are meeting the current quota - thanks to the huge improvements to school sport and record \u00a32.4billion investment up to 2011.\n\nThe statistics, published today in the 2007/08 School Sports Survey, also confirms that the Government has smashed its 85 per cent two-hour target for this year.\n\nThe survey reveals a massive jump in competitive sport participation - with 375,000 more pupils playing inter-school fixtures and half a million more playing competitive games within their own schools, like house and league matches.\n\n\n\nIt also finds that schools offer a wider range of sports than ever before, from football and dance to martial arts and golf.\n\n\n\nBut ministers stressed schools and sports clubs now had to raise their game to reach the new aim for every pupil to have the chance to do five hours PE and sport a week.\n\n\n\nAnd they said that all parents, teachers and community sports clubs needed to pull in the same direction to persuade more children to carry on exercising and doing sport outside school.\n\nSpeaking after the annual School Sport Partnerships Conference in Telford today, Culture Secretary Andy Burnham reinforced the Government's commitment to the five hour target.\n\n\"The next big challenge is to go further and make our two-hour target a five-hour ambition for all young people,\" he said as he made his way to today's Olympic and Paralympic victory parade in London.\n\n\n\n\"Giving coaching, competition, quality opportunities, in and out of the school day to children and giving them at least five hours of sport.\n\n\n\n\"We will build on these foundations but it is an exciting year really for school sport as we approach 2012.\"\n\nDuring the conference Mr Burnham had praised the 2.5 million young people who are now representing their schools in competitive fixtures.\n\nHe said: \"Our Olympic and Paralympic heroes in Beijing were an inspiration to millions of young people and we now have the structure in place so that those that want to get into competitive sport can.\n\n\"As we look to London 2012 we want to get even more children playing sport and uncover more talent who can become our Olympians and Paralympians of tomorrow.\"\n\nChildren's Secretary Ed Balls told the conference that Labour had improved sport in school.\n\nHe said: \"We have made massive progress in the last few years and laid a firm foundation for a permanent 2012 Olympic legacy.\n\n\n\n\"It's a testament to the fantastic, hard work of the Youth Sport Trust, schools and sports clubs.\n\n\n\n\"Ignore the half-pint full critics who carp nothing has changed. School sport was a national embarrassment a decade ago. Sport had all but withered and died in many schools; thousands of playing fields had been sold off; there was negligible investment; and an ingrained anti-competitive culture.\n\n\n\n\"School and youth sport has now never been as well funded; there is a permanent infrastructure and support in place; and more children doing PE and sport than ever before. Children don't want to be wrapped in cotton wool - they want to compete at their own level, in the sports they want.\n\n\n\n\"We now need to raise our game to persuade more children to make the right choices and exercise outside school - children exercising more sport in the holidays and after school so all children can do at least five hours a week.\n\n\n\n\"Medallist after medallist at the Beijing Olympics paid tribute to their families' dedication in helping them achieve their dreams.\n\n\n\n\"The bottom line is that encouraging and supporting their children to exercise should be part and parcel of day to day life for families, whatever their talent - from simply making sure they've got the right PE kit and giving permission for off-school sport activities to training to actively volunteering to help run sports clubs.\n\n\n\n\"We need to engage parents who don't encourage their kids to do exercise because they do not know what is on offer in schools or who were turned off sport by poor facilities and teaching when they were growing up. We need to break the cycle - if today's children don't play sport, then the odds are their own children won't.\n\n\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of parents already play a massive role in helping their children exercise. We need schools and clubs to all to work engage more local parents - and every parent to take responsibility for their children doing exercise and sport outside schools, not just teachers.\"\n\n'Olympic inspiration': Culture Secretary Andy Burnham\n\n\n\nRebecca Adlington, Double Olympic Gold Medallist has welcomed the news.\n\nShe said: \"I would like to congratulate all those responsible for getting even more young people participating in school sport.\n\n\n\n\"We all know just how important sport is for the development of young people, not just in terms of creating our future Olympians and Paralympians but for its ability to raise their confidence, self-esteem and improve the future health of the nation.\n\n\n\n\"I'm aware of how the provision of sport in school has increased in recent years, with better opportunities to participate, compete, lead or volunteer.\n\n\n\n\"The excitement of London 2012 gives everyone even more reason to build on the successes achieved so far and we must keep going.\"\n\n\n\nYouth Sport Trust chief executive Steve Grainger said he was delighted with the progress.\n\nHe said: \"The innovative approaches to PE and school sport, which are being highlighted at the School and Sport Partnerships' Conference in Telford this week, show just how much great progress is being made and we are delighted to see this recognised in the results of the 2007/08 School Sport Survey.\n\n\n\n\"The Youth Sport Trust is privileged to work with a fantastic network of teachers, coaches and managers who are working tirelessly to transform PE and sport at local level and we would like to thank them for their continued dedication and hard work.\n\n\n\n\"Whilst much is being achieved there is still lots to do and all eyes are now firmly on 2012 as the nation prepares to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games and we seek to use this unique opportunity to build a world leading PE and school Sport system that offers all young people access to five hours of sport a week.\"\n\n\n\nMike Diaper, Sport England Executive Director for Children and Young People, highlighted that youngsters have a wealth of opportunities to take part in sport.\n\n\n\n\"There are now more sporting opportunities than ever for children and young people.\n\n\n\n\"On average schools now have formal links to almost eight different sports clubs - a 50 per cent increase over four years.\n\n\n\n\"Getting young people into community sports clubs is the best way to keep them involved in sport once they leave school.\"", "images":

"text": "20,000 migrant workers register for London Olympics jobs - despite pledge to provide work for local people\n\nPromises of a 'skills legacy' from the London Olympics were in doubt today as it emerged that 20,000 migrant workers had registered for jobs in the main 2012 borough in the past year.\n\n\n\nThe surge in new National Insurance numbers in Newham has prompted concerns over pledges to provide thousands of skilled construction jobs to the local community.\n\n\n\nAbout 2,700 workers are on the Olympics site, rising to 9,000 by 2010. Estimates of the number of migrant workers there - mostly from Poland and Baltic states within the European Union - range from 10 to 70 per cent.\n\n\n\nUp to 2,700 workers are currently at the Olympic site in London, with the number expected to rise by 2010\n\nAccording to the Olympic Delivery Authority's last month employment figures for the Olympic Park, 58 per cent of the 2,700 workforce were resident in London and 24 per cent from the East End. However, the figures do not indicate the worker's nationality - or how long they have lived in Britain.\n\n\n\nLabour MP Frank Field, who published the National Insurance figures, said: 'It is totally lawful but British taxpayers and lottery players are paying for jobs for foreign workers and it is not what we signed up for.\"'\n\nThe ODA has promised a skills legacy for east London and is in the forefront of the Government's agenda under which Gordon Brown promised 'British jobs for British workers'.\n\n\n\nThe ODA has a plant training school at the Olympic Park and says one in 10 of its workforce was previously unemployed. But the ODA is also under pressure to balance its books after losing \u00a3500million in private sector investment in a year with the credit crunch and, according to unions, has targeted savings on labour costs.\n\n\n\nConstruction workers' union Ucatt is increasing pressure on the ODA to continue to honour agreed minimum site rates. It is thought that migrant workers hired through agencies are typically paid up to \u00a32 less per hour than their British counterparts.\n\n\n\nOlympic logo\n\nA spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that more local people are not trained on the site in traditional construction apprenticeships to create a real skills legacy.'\n\nHackney MP Diane Abbott told a Commons debate on the Olympic legacy: 'One way in which the big contractors are getting round and massaging the figures for local labour is by bringing labourers from all over Europe into the Olympic boroughs and putting them in hostels.\n\n\n\n'Those labourers are then counted as local people but in fact they have been shipped in from all parts of Europe.'\n\nHowever the ODA said its site enrolment form distinguishes between permanent addresses and temporary ones.\n\n\n\nA spokesman said: 'We are trying to ensure that where possible the Olympic Park workforce reflects the diversity of the local area and offers opportunities to help unemployed people back into work.\n\n\n\n'We take care with the figures that we publish and ask every worker on the site for both their current address and their permanent UK address and we only report our figures based on the permanent address.'\n\nThe big rise in NI numbers issued in Newham has also been driven by the East London line project and the Stratford City retail complex, bringing the total number of construction workers in Stratford to more than 5,000.\n\n\n\nWork was starting today to pull down the first of 52 pylons at the Olympic Park. Two tunnels will carry power lines underground for the Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

Ministers 'knew 2012 Olympics will bring little benefit to Britain'", "text": "Another \u00a39.3bn down the drain? Ministers 'knew 2012 Olympics will bring little benefit to Britain'\n\nMinisters were warned by their own experts that the Olympics in 2012 will be little more than a national party, with scant economic or long-term sporting returns.\n\nA 250-page official document warned when the London bid succeeded that the main motivation for the 16-day event should be 'national celebration' because the 'economic rationale is weak'.\n\nIn the three years since, the budget for the Games has risen to \u00a39.35billion - nearly four times the initial \u00a32.4billion.\n\nThe cost to the taxpayer of the 2012 Games has more than tripled to \u00a39.3 billion. Above is an artist's impression of the Olympic Stadium\n\nThe report came to light at the same time as the Government announced this week that it would plough another \u00a329million into the Games to reduce the funding black hole.\n\n\n\nTen experts spent a year researching the 'Game Plan' report, signed off by former Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2002.\n\nThe document concluded: 'The quantifiable evidence to support each of the perceived benefits of mega-events is weak . . . they appear to be more about celebration than economic return.'\n\nBut just months later, Mr Blair insisted that although taxpayers would be forced to foot much of the bill for the Games, it would 'pay dividends for all of us'.\n\nLondon 2012 chairman Lord Coe\n\nMPs have already called for an 'Austerity Games' similar to when London last staged the event in 1948 - with no new stadiums, no athletes' village and barely enough food for competitors.\n\nLast week, the 2012 organising chairman Lord Coe insisted the Games would have an 'extraordinary economic impact' on the UK.\n\nJohn Clark, the report's chief author, said: 'We concluded that countries should host the Olympics only for reasons of national celebration because the economic rationale is weak.'\n\nDespite this, the government's publicity machine went into overdrive to sell London as the 2012 venue, bringing in top Olympians such as Lord Coe to head up the bid.\n\n\n\nCrucially, ministers claimed it would regenerate East London and increase participation in sport.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime 'Game Plan' was dismissed and buried as an 'inconvenient truth', said Stefan Szymanski, a professor at Cass Business School and one of the authors.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'Almost the moment the ink was dry, there was a volte-face.'\n\n\n\nAlex Story, a former Olympic rower who monitors 2012 for the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'On both the cost and the benefits to youngsters, ministers oversold the Games. It was a false prospectus; they knew it was unrealistic.'\n\nNews of the report emerged as Games bosses meet to decide how to cut funding for Olympic sports including hockey and basketball. UK Sport, responsible for nurturing sport in Britain, is facing a \u00a379 million black hole in its \u00a3300 million budget.\n\n\n\nOlympics Minister Tessa Jowell has already admitted the bid would not have gone ahead if the government knew about the recession.\n\n\n\nSome \u00a3550 million of lottery funds have been channelled into the Olympics and away from grassroots sports. Arts have lost around \u00a3300 million through diversion of funds.\n\n\n\nHugh Robertson, the Shadow Sports Minister, said: 'By ruthlessly suppressing the report without addressing its conclusions, the Government has knowingly wasted huge amounts of public money that could have been used to improve sport in this country.'\n\nLast night a DCMS spokesman said the 'Game Plan' report stated that there would be no additional benefits only if Britain merely staged the Olympics.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'What we are doing is putting in place a number of additional measures to allow us to get these benefits.'\n\n\n\nLord Coe's final summary to the International Olympic Committee read: 'Your decision today is critical. It is a decision about which bid offers the vision and sporting legacy to best promote the Olympic cause. It is a decision about which city will help us show a new generation why sport matters; in a world of many distractions, why Olympic sport matters.'\n\nTony Blair also highlighted the importance of legacy as London made its bid.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'I think hosting the Games would be a tremendous thing for the country and a tremendous thing obviously for Britain and British sport.\n\n\n\n'I think what we have now got to do is go out and show to people that the country as a whole is absolutely behind it, and that what we will achieve by having the Olympics in London is not just a good Olympics for three weeks, but a lasting sporting legacy for the country.'\n\n\n\nThe government's Olympic 'Legacy Action Plan', which was used to help win the bid, included in its targets: 'To transform the heart of East London.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

is the Olympic legacy?' Zara Phillips slams decision to build temporary equestrian event centre in Greenwich", "text": "'Where is the Olympic legacy?' Zara Phillips slams decision to build temporary equestrian event centre in Greenwich\n\n\n\nZara Phillips, pictured at the Hambleden Horse Trials in Henley-on-Thames last year, has waded into the Olympic row\n\nBuilding the Olympic equestrian centre in London's Greenwich Park will fail to leave a legacy for the sport, Zara Phillips said today.\n\nWading into the controversy over where the centre should be built, the Queen's grandaughter said it was pointless building a temporary venue that would be taken down again.\n\nIn an interview with The Times, Ms Phillips -an eventing world champion and a likely contender for the British team in 2012 - said Windsor would be better suited for a permanent arena that could be used in the future.\n\nIn November the London Olympic Organising Committee confirmed Greenwich Park as the location for a temporary 23,000-seat arena and four-mile cross-country course - a decision backed by the British Equestrian Foundation.\n\n\n\nMs Phillips told The Times: 'What is annoying is that they put something there and then take it all down afterwards.\n\n'What's the point of that?\n\n\n\n'Why don't you do it to a space that can used with a legacy, not Greenwich Park where people walk their dogs?\n\n'I thought that was the whole point of bidding for the Games?'\n\nHer comments come a week after campaign group No to Greenwich Equestrian Events sent an open letter requesting the support of Ms Phillips' mother, the Princess Royal - also an accomplished horsewoman who rode for Great Britain in the 1976 Olympics.\n\nGreenwich Park, above, will be closed for one year to house the sporting venue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

60s and under 16s to swim for free at council pools in new Olympic drive", "text": "Over 60s and under 16s to swim for free at council pools in new Olympic drive\n\n\n\nTop swimmers joined politicians today for the launch of a new scheme to offer free swimming to 20 million people in England.\n\nThe \u00a3140 million scheme will offer free swimming to over-60s and under-16s across the country from tomorrow.\n\nIt was launched today at the Eltham Centre in Greenwich, south east London.\n\nMaking a splash: The scheme, which launches tomorrow, will see under 16s and over 60s enjoy free access to council-run pools\n\n\n\nThe event was attended by Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Andy Burnham, Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell, 400m freestyle world record holder Joanne Jackson, Paralympic gold medallist Heather Frederiksen, and Olympic swimmer and Strictly Come Dancing star Mark Foster.\n\n\n\nThe scheme will see more than 1,000 pools run by almost 300 local councils offer free swimming from tomorrow for people aged 60 and over or 16 and under.\n\nThe \u00a3140 million Government cash injection, announced last June, is part of a promise to help get 2 million people more active by the time London hosts the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.\n\nFour out of every five councils in England have signed up to provide free swimming for over-60s, with more than 200 offering it to young people.\n\n\n\nIt will see 20 million people able to swim free, using pools in other areas if their own council is not participating.\n\nThe scheme, which will see 20million people enjoy free access to pools, was launched by swimmer Mark Foster and Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell\n\n\n\nMr Burnham said: 'This is a landmark moment in our bid to build a healthier and more active nation.\n\n'It is real evidence of our ambition to use the Olympic and Paralympic Games to lift sport in this country.\n\n'It is also the day when London 2012 made a real difference on the ground, and to people up and down the country.\n\n\n\n'We have worked with local councils of all political persuasions to seize the opportunity - and many of them have joined us in making a significant financial contribution to ensure its success.\n\n'This scheme has caught the mood of the times. It will help young and old keep active and save cash.\n\n'It is our hope that this is just the beginning and that in time free swimming becomes the norm across the country.'\n\nComedian and keen swimmer David Walliams is also backing the scheme\n\n\n\nThe scheme is also being backed by actor and comedian David Walliams, who swam the English Channel for Sport Relief in 2006.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'Swimming has been a real passion of mine since I took it up as a small child.\n\n'But I was really jumping in the deep end when I swam the English Channel for Sport Relief, fitting training in between performances on the road of Little Britain Live.\n\n\n\n'I hope that by making swimming free for so many in this country we will encourage people to find the time to swim.\n\n\n\n'Just a few lengths is a really great way of getting active and staying healthy. I am right behind this initiative and I hope that millions of people will grab the opportunity and take the plunge.'\n\nIn total 288 councils across England will offer free swimming for the over-60s and 207 local authorities will also provide it for children and young people aged 16 and under.\n\nUntil now only around 10 have offered any year-round free access.\n\n\n\nThe scheme, which is guaranteed to run for at least two years, will see more than \u00a331 million go to local councils in the first year to help meet the cost of providing free access to pools during standard swimming sessions.\n\n\n\nCouncils providing free swimming for both age groups have already been allocated \u00a310 million to improve their local facilities.\n\n\n\nA \u00a350 million capital fund is being made available to councils to modernise existing facilities or help build new ones over the next two years.\n\nThe first grants of \u00a319.2 million are announced today for 54 projects - with the biggest awards of more than \u00a31 million going to improved or new facilities in the London boroughs of Southwark and Harrow, Leicestershire, Calderdale, Nottingham and Waveney.\n\nThe drive will also bring a national network of swimming experts recruited to work with participating councils and 100,000 non-swimmers will also be offered free lessons.\n\n'Landmark moment': Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Andy Burnham\n\nExtra funding within the overall package is being promised to participating councils, including a reward to those with the best record in developing the scheme and making an impact in their communities.\n\n\n\nCouncils will also be eligible to seek London 2012's 'Inspire' mark, as recognition of the impact of their schemes.\n\nHealth Secretary Alan Johnson said today: 'Swimming is fun and it is very good for you - it is one of the best exercises for the whole body.\n\n'I urge new swimmers and those who have not swum for a while to head down to their local pool and swim for free.\n\n\n\n'Whether you are 16 or 60, if you eat well and move more, you can live longer, healthier and happier lives.'\n\nHis comments were echoed by Children, Schools and Families Secretary Ed Balls, Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell and Communities and Local Government Secretary Hazel Blears.\n\nMs Jowell said: 'From tomorrow, around 20 million people will be able to take a dip without dipping into their pocket.\n\n\n\n'That's a real Olympic legacy that will play a big part in persuading two million more people to get active by 2012.\n\n\n\n'With stars like Rebecca Adlington and Joanne Jackson making real waves in international competition and the Olympics around the corner, this is the perfect time to start opening up the country's pools for free.'\n\nDavid Sparkes, chief executive of the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA), added:\n\n\n\n'The investment of \u00a3140 million in free swimming affords us with a massive opportunity and one the ASA is determined to capitalise on.\n\n\n\n'This will be the first time that there has been a national structure to share best practice on how to deliver swimming and it will provide exciting opportunities to those councils that have opted in.'\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

some Olympic projects being delayed or shelved.\n\n\n\nThe investigation team is focusing on the Olympic Legacy Directorate, which is responsible for compensating businesses forced out of the Olympic site in Stratford, East London.\n\n\n\nGareth Blacker, who headed the department, and another senior colleague have been suspended, although there is no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nMr Blacker's department had agreed a price of \u00a31million an acre to compensate each business occupying land needed for development.\n\n\n\nBut four years after the contract was signed, it has yet to pay 72 businesses out of more than 3,000 companies and individuals involved. The money owed is thought to be between \u00a360million and \u00a3100million and the 'hole' relates to the department's failure to put the cash aside.\n\n\n\nThe accountants will now decide whether this was a genuine oversight by Mr Blacker's department.\n\n\n\nConcerns were first raised in March after London Mayor Boris Johnson ordered a financial audit of the London Development Agency, of which the Legacy Directorate is a part.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the agency admitted that the audit had revealed some 'additional spending commitments' but said no money was missing and the shortfall could be made up by savings elsewhere.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'We have identified ways of absorbing this without affecting core programmes.'\n\nCost alert: The Olympic Stadium taking shape\n\nThe spokesman added: 'Since the new mayor has come in we have been reviewing governance and procedures across the agency.\n\n\n\n'As the last part of that review, and in preparation for the transition to the new Olympic Legacy Company, we have identified additional spendingcommitments within the Olympic Legacy Directorate that have exceeded our estimated figures.\n\n\n\n'Because of the work we have already done to achieve greater value for money, we have been able to adjust our budgets and accommodate these commitments with minimal impact on our plans for London.'\n\n\n\nIt is not the first time the LDA, which is overseen by Mr Johnson, has been accused over the use of taxpayers' money.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year it emerged that it spent \u00a31.85million rehousing travellers, whose camp was needed for a handball arena, to a gated development in Clapton, East London.\n\n\n\nThe move outraged local people, some of whom live in cramped accommodation overlooking the travellers' new three-bedroom bungalows.\n\n\n\nIt has also emerged that a Government report has raised the threat level of an overspend on the Olympics from 'amber' to 'amber-red' as a result of the recession.\n\n\n\nProblems include the cost of venues soaring by almost \u00a3100million over the past year.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

race\n\n\n\nThis weekend, weather permitting, you may feel like getting out for a bit.\n\nPrune the roses, maybe mow the lawn. Perhaps you will go for a mooch along the High Street, or take the dog for a walk in the park.\n\nIf you do, you probably will not be aware that you are participating in Britain's great Olympic leap forward.\n\nGardening games: If you mow your lawn this weekend, you could be part of the two million people ministers hope will be be more active as part of the Olympics\n\nAs you get to work with the secateurs, the seeders and spreaders, and, that most important garden tool of all, the Visa card, little will you realise that you are one of two million the Government intends to make physically active as part of the 'legacy' of the 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nYou may disagree.\n\nYou may feel that your move towards a healthier, fitter existence is simply due to some nasty-looking couch grass that has started to appear near the hydrangeas, not to mention that ivy which was meant to give the front the appearance of a country cottage but has brought down half the guttering and may be home to a nest of, well, God knows what, but they scuttle.\n\nBut, no. For it is the Government's intention to include novice weekend gardeners, walkers and, get this, DIY enthusiasts among the two million Britons it claims will have taken up sport or physical exercise by 2012.\n\nLord Sebastian Coe kept that one a bit quiet when he presented London's bid to the International Olympic Committee in Singapore, didn't he?\n\nNo mention of lawn maintenance when he sold them the concept of a Britain that would be revitalised by Olympic ideals and reborn into a new area of physical health and well-being.\n\n'So, Lord Coe, what particular sports will your Olympic legacy target?'\n\n'Edging, mostly.'\n\n'Edging?'\n\n\n\n'Yes, round the beds, keeping a nice tight line. I mean, some of those curves can be tricky. You need a steady hand, a keen eye.'\n\n\n\n'I see. Any others? Running, tennis?'\n\n\n\n'Strimming.'\n\n\n\n'I'm sorry?'\n\n\n\n'Strimming. I know what you are going to say - it's the machine, not the man. But I'll tell you, get your hands on one of those new Honda four-strokes and you'll work up quite a sweat.'\n\n\n\n'Er, one part of your Olympic delivery strategy confuses us. This reference to, er, Yorkshire terriers?'\n\n\n\n'Ah, yes. It is our plan to start an intensive breeding programme so that by 2012 every town hall in Britain will have access to 50 or so what we call Community Yorkies, available for walking, Frisbee catching or just all-purpose nipping down the paper shop for a News of the World and a packet of Bensons.\n\n'We are already well down the line on sponsorship for this one.'\n\n\n\n'But, Lord Coe, you cannot seriously think that -\n\n\n\n'I know what you're going to say. Little legs. I thought that, too, at first.\n\n\n\n'But our research shows that your average Yorkshire terrier has an energy level far above other dogs in its class. Good temperament, too, and cheap.\n\n'Then there's the room. You can't have four dozen Great Danes banged up at the council offices all week waiting to be taken out.\n\n'It would be chaos. You'll find we have gone through this with a fine tooth-comb.\n\n'I understand you're seeing the Paris Olympic delegation next, and, if I can speak frankly for a moment, I feel that on this issue we are the only bid that is offering a serious legacy for mowing, weeding, putting up the odd shelf and walkies.\n\n'I mean, what have the French got to offer in this area? Poodles? I rest my case.'\n\n\n\nThere was no mention of gardeners or weekend strollers when the Government made promises concerning physical activity; just as there was no mention of costs that have spiralled to \u00a39billion from early estimates, which we now know were deliberately miscalculated and false.\n\nLast month, two senior Olympic executives were suspended over a hole in the London 2012 accounts. Its size? One hundred million pounds. That is a canyon, not a hole.\n\nAnd we are so weary at hearing the abuses and misdirection around our Olympic budget and legacy that it barely registers any more.\n\nThe latest missing money was supposed to go to the businesses that were forced out of the Olympic site in Stratford; but four years after the deals were agreed, 72 companies are still awaiting payment.\n\nOn the bright side, though, if your business has just been bullied out of existence, you will have plenty of time to do the garden, lay a new patio and walk the dog.\n\nSo you'll be one of the two million people who are fitter and healthier as part of our grand Olympic legacy; although too skint to enjoy it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs 'Sorry' the hardest word?\n\n\n\nNobody says sorry any more.\n\nI ordered some business cards last month - just little compliments slips to let the taxman know how much we love him when we send off the cheque.\n\nA few days later, we received a delivery from the printer. Instead of our order, there was batch of cards containing a picture of a baby girl: 'Annabel, Mai 13, 2009. Es liefen eine ganze weile vier grosse fusse ganz alleine doch ab jetzt laufen schritt fur schritt zwei winzig kleine fusschen mit.'\n\nWe contacted the printers to explain their error. They replied without contrition, but confirming they would replace the cards with the ones we had ordered 'at no extra cost to you'.\n\nHow thoroughly decent of them. And good luck to Annabel with her first VAT return, too.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26157344-0-image-a-11_1584611009461.jpg",

I\u2019m sorry, this is nothing short of a national disgrace\n\nWhen the medals are won and the anthems are sung and the last, weary athlete has shuffled off home to Kiribati or Kyrgyzstan, the nation will sink back in its sofa and marvel at the memories.\n\n\n\nWe shall recall the achievements, the agonies and the compelling dramas of three wondrous weeks of sport in the greatest capital on earth.\n\nAnd our memories will revolve around the spot where it all happened, the enchanted 250-acre site where the youth of the world came to live out their dreams at the London Olympics.\n\nA rundown part of London will be transformed because of the 2012 Olympics - it deserves a better post-games name than Elizabeth Park\n\nThe place which henceforth will be known as . . . Elizabeth Park.\n\nSome mistake? Apparently not. Under a plan proposed by the borough of Newham and endorsed by Downing Street, Buckingham Palace and the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, the London Olympics will have no tangible memorial. Instead, the field of dreams will bear the name of the reigning monarch, an estimable woman who played no part in their delivery and will take little or no interest in their progress.\n\nIt is, quite simply, an outrage. Even monarchists might agree that, with all those boats and bridges, hospitals and concert halls bearing her name, future generations are unlikely to forget Elizabeth II. And yet, in a quite unnecessary show of deference, a docile Establishment bends the knee once again.\n\nThe man who came up with this wheeze is one Sir Robin Wales, the Mayor of Newham. He says: \u2018The great affection with which Newham and the rest of East London holds all things royal is well known. We all remember how the Queen Mother inspired the East End during The Blitz.\u2019\n\n\n\nThis is the Labour mayor of a deprived inner-city borough, peddling the \u2018Gawd-bless-yer-Marm\u2019 cliches of a Pearly King. I am reminded of a letter written to\n\nthe learned journal, Viz:\n\n\u2018We should remember the tremendous contribution of the Queen Mother to the war\n\neffort. As the BBC pointed out, she \u201cbravely remained in London beside her husband\u201d during the war. This contrasts sharply with the actions of my grandfather who, on the declaration of war, immediately left his wife and children and ****ed off, first to France,\n\nthen North Africa, Italy, France (again) and finally Germany. The shame will always be with us.\u2019\n\nBanging his gong: Boris Johnson needs to take action on this matter\n\nNow, if we were dealing only with the forelock-tugging idiocy of daft Sir Robin, then the problem would be swiftly solved. But some of the other parties involved give real cause for concern. What possessed a Government \u2014 even one as desperate as this\n\n\u2014 to fall so meekly into line? And Mayor Johnson, whose duty is to safeguard\n\nhis city\u2019s Olympic legacy, yet who enthusiastically supports the scheme to erase the Olympics from London\u2019s memory: Is he cynical, devious or merely obsequious?\n\nWhatever his motives, they do him no credit.\n\nThe British Olympic Association, with the Princess Royal as its president, finds itself in a delicate position.\n\n\n\nBut it points out that: \u2018It is important that the public has something to remember the 2012 Olympics by, as there is no bricks and mortar legacy from previous London Games of 1908 and 1948.\u2019\n\nShamefully, the BOA has not been consulted over the proposed name. If and when it is, it must speak truth to power. Because it is the thrilling reality of a London Olympics which have regenerated that long-neglected slice of East London. It is the Olympics\n\nwhich have created the largest urban park Europe has seen for 200 years.Without the Olympics \u2014 and the impetus, urgency and focus they have engendered \u2014 nothing would have happened.\n\n\n\nWe would have heard a stream of highsounding excuses, from arcane planning laws to the credit-crunching recession. But there would have been no rejuvenation. Indeed, not one brick would have been laid upon another.\n\n\n\nAnd how do we plan to mark their titanic contribution to the life of our capital city and our nation? Why, by pretending they never happened, by air-brushing them out of our history. It is more than an outrage, it is a scandal.\n\n\n\nYet an entirely avoidable scandal.\n\n\n\nBefore still more calamitous errors are made we should take matters out of the hands of self-serving, star-struck mayors. We should ask the Prime Minister to get off his knees and come to his senses. And we should make sure that the message penetrates the Palace.\n\nFor the London Olympic Park is a jewel for the ages, a prize worth fighting for. We must not let it go.\n\nPhil\u2019s cunning plan to ease \u00a364m debt\n\nA year has passed since Phil Gartside, the chairman of Bolton Wanderers, tried to\n\npersuade English football\u2019s leading clubs to vote for a two-division Premier League\n\nwith no relegation.\n\nNaturally, he was not trying to guarantee Bolton a permanent place at the Premier trough. No, he was earnestly attempting to safeguard the deserving greedy. Yet still his plan was rejected because it didn\u2019t suit the greediest clubs.\n\nBut Phil is no quitter and this week he will present an amended version. As before, there will be two divisions of 18 clubs. This time Rangers and Celtic would be added,\n\nbecause the vigilant Gartside has heard that they attract a good many followers. And,\n\ncrucially, relegation would be retained. But here\u2019s the catch.\n\nClubs would be promoted only if they could meet stringent standards of size and finance. So how high would those standards be set?\n\n\n\nFor instance, would an aspiring club be promoted after posting a loss of \u00a313.2 million\n\nlast season and carrying a net debt of \u00a364m? Because that is the situation in which Bolton Wanderers find themselves.\n\n\n\nThese are questions for the guru named Gartside. I just know that he\u2019ll come up with\n\nconvincing answers when he meets his Premier League chums this week.\n\nSwann\u2019s far more Tufnell than a Warne\n\nThey say that Graeme Swann is the chirpiest of chaps and we can well believe it. His Test career may be just 12 matches old but he delivers his opinions with the breezy\n\nconfidence of a seasoned sage.\n\nPlaying the fool too often: Graeme Swann\n\nThe man seems incapable of walking past a microphone or stifling a jest. Indeed,\n\nthere were times when the Ashes summer felt like an extended Swann stand-up routine.\n\nHe was at it again last week, on the eve of the South African tour. \u2018I would walk Strictly\n\nCome Dancing,\u2019 he prattled. \u2018Honest, you should see me move. I am absolutely brilliant. Cricketers are the most natural sportsmen going. Footballers are the lads\n\nwho couldn\u2019t count at school and rugby players are the accountants and bullies who couldn\u2019t get into the cricket team.\u2019\n\nThe lines probably sounded better at rehearsal. And yet Swann clearly intends to construct a career as a \u2018card\u2019 and the fact that he has absolutely no talent to amuse will not deter him. I suspect he would swap 10 Test wickets for the chance to rub shoulders with the desperate wannabes of Strictly or I\u2019m A Celebrity.\n\n\n\nA kind counsellor might encourage him to drop the jokes, restrict the interviews and\n\nconcentrate on developing into something more than an unremarkable Test spinner.\n\nIn an ideal world, he would dream of becoming the new Shane Warne. Instead, he seems depressingly anxious to become the new Phil Tufnell.\n\nP.S.\n\nRespectful congratulations to Manchester United and Liverpool for resisting attempts to coerce them into wearing poppies on their shirts this Remembrance weekend.\n\n\n\nBoth clubs do an immense amount for services charities and they rightly resent being asked to provide trite proof of their patriotism. It is a curiously un-British impulse, this impertinent desire to dictate how the dead shall be remembered.\n\n\n\nThose of us who wear the poppy will do so in the knowledge that it symbolises, at least in part, the victory of quiet, undemonstrative men and women over shrill and vulgar bullies.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

Samuel: Tessa Jowell deserves an Olympic medal in utter madness", "text": "An Olympic medal in utter madness as Tessa Jowell aims to deliver Hammer blow to West Ham's future Stratford move\n\n\n\nEthnikos Piraeus are a mid-table Greek second division team that has seen better days. It fell out of the top tier ten years ago, has never been back and in 2003-04, spent the season in Delta Ethniki, the Greek fourth division.\n\n\n\nEthnikos would claim to be rivals to OIympiacos but this is an illusion. Olympiacos have won 37 national titles and the Greek Cup on 24 occasions. Ethnikos held the Greek Cup, once, in 1933.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the club has been noteworthy for another reason. In August 2007, its president, Nikos Pirounias, struck a three-year deal to use the Elliniko Stadium, near Glyfada on the Mediterranean coast.\n\n\n\nDon't turn it into a white elephant: London\u2019s Olympic Stadium is still under construction, but what will happen to it after 2012?\n\nElliniko was formerly the Helliniko Baseball Centre, and a venue of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, making it the sole purpose-built structure from that event still in regular use exclusively for sport. The nation that funded this extravagant three-week jamboree is now on the brink of bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nSurveying the wreckage six years on, Sypros Capralos, president of the Hellenic Olympic Committee said that too many venues had been built that did not serve the needs of the country after the Olympics.\n\n\n\nAgainst the backdrop of an abandoned velodrome, a diving pool that now contains four inches of stagnant water and an empty rowing centre costing in the region of \u00a3133m, the message is clear: give the people what they want, not what you think they need.\n\n\n\nThis is a hard concept for a person like Tessa Jowell, the Olympics Minister, to understand. She is from a government very used to telling people what to do. Ken Livingstone, the former Mayor of London, was equally pig-headed. From the start, he would not countenance use of the Olympic Stadium for football after the 2012 Games.\n\n\n\nIn the present financial climate this is madness. We hear a lot about an Olympic legacy but in Athens that would appear to be the millions paid in maintenance for locations that are fenced off, boarded up and derelict.\n\n\n\nMaintenance on the Helliniko Olympic Complex alone stands at roughly \u00a365m annually.\n\n\n\nLast week, Jowell appeared to dismiss the suggestion the Olympic Stadium could one day be the home of West Ham United.\n\n\n\n'It will be a grand prix athletics stadium, because we need one,' she said. No we don\u2019t.\n\n\n\nWe need a stadium that can be used for grand prix athletics which is something different entirely.\n\n\n\nOwn goal: Olympic Minister Tessa Jowell and Lord Coe insist the Olympic Stadium in Stratford should have an ever-lasting legacy of athletics - not football\n\n\n\nThere will be a way, just as there is at the Stade de France outside Paris, for athletics and football to co-exist. Indeed, among the proposals currently being drawn up by West Ham is one that includes provision for football, athletics and, in the summer, Twenty20 cricket. This is working towards serving the needs of a country. No legacy of expensive maintenance, and popular sports that capture the public imagination.\n\nIt would be nice if life was fair and all athletes got the support they merited. It does not seem right that a mediocre left-back at a Premier League football club can be a millionaire, yet Amy Williams has to win an Olympic gold medal to be recognised. Then again, it would be nice if people thought 30 Rock was funnier than My Family and watched BBC Four documentaries about Brian Eno rather than Pop Idol, but what are you going to do?\n\n\n\nLast week, I saw Reading, the best hockey club in England, defeat Beeston to stay top of the Premier League in front of no more than a hundred spectators, most of whom were friends or family. When I asked the price of admission the chap laughed. The programme cost two quid and he must have sold about five.\n\n\n\nYet the day before, Reading Football Club, who are pretty useless and languish near the bottom of the Championship, drew 18,008 for an FA Cup tie with West Bromwich Albion. In an ideal world, those numbers would be reversed.\n\nGood to talk: West Ham co-chairmen Gold and Sullivan are keen on a move\n\n\n\nLarge crowds would admire the talented hockey players of Reading at the Madejski Stadium, while the town\u2019s wretched footballers would languish in anonymity in the corner of a park. Yet what would be the point in erecting structures based on what we thought should happen? This is what the London Olympic Committee wishes to do.\n\n\n\nThis is what the Hellenic Olympic Committee did when building a designated hockey stadium, when its national team was so weak it did not even qualify for the Athens Olympics. The Hellinikon Olympic Hockey Centre now hosts mini-football games. Sometimes.\n\n\n\nEd Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, says putting a football club at the Olympic Stadium could jeopardise London\u2019s chances of hosting the 2015 World Athletics Championships. Big deal. Is that what we are holding on for, then, two international meetings three years apart, and an annual Grand Prix night that will fall off the radar if it coincides with an event people care: about like a big football match?\n\nThere is talk of a legacy for the community, but the best way to ensure that is to get Newham, the local council, and West Ham, the local football club, involved. The club, as private enterprise, would have to pay its way, obviously, and an athletics facility would need to be part of the deal. Beyond that, start with a blank sheet of paper and see what can be achieved.\n\nMoving on: The Hammers are prime candidates to quit Upton Park for Stratford\n\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee would not be as hostile as is imagined. In a global financial crisis it is bad for their reputation to be held responsible for the impoverishment of major cities. They have already taken note and compromised over Londonby agreeing to revised, cost-cutting measures that allow badminton and gymnastics to take place at an existing venue, Wembley Arena.\n\n\n\nWhat happens after the Olympic show has left town is every bit as important as controlling costs now. There is a high risk of white elephants, the Olympic Delivery Authority was warned last week. In which case, maybe we could open a zoo. We\u2019ll get more through the gate than will watch the athletics.\n\nEuro refs should be shown red card\n\nTom Henning Ovrebo, of Norway, turned in quite the worst performance many can remember when in charge of Chelsea\u2019s match against Barcelona last season, but that has not altered his status within UEFA.\n\n\n\nHe was given Bayern Munich\u2019s Champions League second-round tie with Fiorentina and celebrated by failing to spot that Munich's winning goal was offside by more than a yard.\n\n\n\nMarching orders: Blunder ref Tom Henning Ovrebo shows Fiorentina's Massimo Gobbi the red card against Bayern Munich\n\nHis errors tend to benefit the bigger team, so maybe he is easily impressed. Ovrebo was certainly overawed by the occasion at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\n\nThen there is Martin Hansson, of Sweden, whose bizarre behaviour around a Porto\n\nfree-kick contributed to Arsenal\u2019s defeat last Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHis award of an indirect free-kick when Lukasz Fabianski picked up a back-pass from Sol Campbell was correct and Fabianski\u2019s decision to turn his back on the game to run back to his goal having disputed it was idiotic.\n\nBizarre behaviour: Martin Hansson was quick to assist Falcao's winner for Porto\n\n\n\nYet Hansson\u2019s position in the middle of the action when he allowed the quick free-kick to be taken was unusual, and his raised-arm signal that play could go ahead came after the Porto restart, not before.\n\nArsenal, and in particular Fabianski, compounded the situation, but that does not make Hansson\u2019s performance any more convincing than the night he missed the Thierry Henry handball that sent France to the World Cup.\n\n\n\nThese calamities are now such regular occurrences that if there is an image encapsulating Champions League football, it is no longer a great goal, or a colourful, noisy, stadium, but another abysmal mistake from an Over-Promoted, Useless, Scandinavian Official (OPUSO).\n\n\n\nThere must be a little factory producing them somewhere because they are multiplying.\n\nAnd while we're at it...\n\nBarred from the Dubai Tennis Championships last year, Shahar Peer, the Israeli tennis player, was this time dispatched to a minor court for her semi-final with Venus Williams.\n\n\n\nPOTATO, PATARTO...\n\nFlavio Briatore has stepped down as chairman of Queens Park Rangers.\n\nHe says he was \u2018proud to have saved this historical club and to have contributed to paving the way to their future success\u2019.\n\nOf course, what Briatore will actually be remembered for is 10 managers in two years and telling a bloke to drive his Formula 1 car into a wall.\n\nStill, potato, potarto.\n\n\n\nApparently it was for security reasons. She has played surrounded by bodyguards throughout, has had no contact with any player outside court, changed in a small room in a separate block to the other competitors and travelled only between her hotel and the facilities.\n\n\n\nThe tournament advertised just one women\u2019s semi-final in the local Gulf Times \u2014 it was not Peer\u2019s \u2014 and her presence and progress has been briefly mentioned, if recorded at all.\n\n\n\nShe was not allowed to hold press conferences and one reporter out of the 250 present was permitted an interview in her quarters after each match.\n\n\n\nWhen asked what she would remember most about the tournament, Peer deadpanned: \u2018This room.\u2019\n\n\n\nLovely country, Dubai.\n\nIt\u2019s prejudiced to label football as intolerant\n\nTalking about the reaction since coming out as a gay man, former British Lions captain Gareth Thomas says he has had nothing but support.\n\n\n\nPlenty of support: Rugby Union star Thomas\n\nDisappointingly, he also endorses the presumption that it would be harder for a professional footballer to gain acceptance.\n\n\n\nThomas says he gets wolf whistles from the crowd and ribald banter from his team-mates, but nothing he would term abusive. This is, he says, part of the game. So why would football be different? If we accept that teasing an opposition player is part of the culture \u2014 and to call what Thomas receives homophobic is akin to saying John Terry is targeted for being heterosexual \u2014 and that all players are used to the often crude wit of the dressing room, what is exceptional?\n\n\n\nDoes anyone imagine a footballer would be sold, sacked, or ostracised by his team-mates because he was gay?\n\n\n\nAnd is it not unfair to label football in this way and presume its intolerance, rather than wait for the theory to be tested? One could almost call the attitudes prejudiced.\n\nNow that David Dein has been appointed international president of the England 2018 World Cup bid, is it not time to review the worth of Lord PleasedMan, the Football Association chairman and salaried head of the team.\n\n\n\nHe currently receives \u00a3150,000 a year for a two-day week. Be generous and say he takes just a fortnight off annually and it still works out at \u00a33,000 per week, or \u00a31,500 a day.\n\n\n\nExtrapolate that to a full-time job and PleasedMan would command approaching \u00a3550,000.\n\n\n\nNow that Dein has to pick up the pieces of a bid revived only by David Beckham\u2019s one-man show in South Africa, will we admit that PleasedMan\u2019s salary is an unnecessary expense?\n\nRobinho does not want to return to Manchester City.\n\n\u2018Maybe if Ii had gone to another club it would have been better for me,\u2019 he says.\n\nBut he was at another club. He was at Real Madrid, and he stuffed that up, too.\n\nHappy at home: Robinho does not want to return to City now he is back in Brazil\n\nNow, with Santos, he seems happy. Could it be that in the increasingly mediocre Brazilian league, shorn of their greatest talent by European money, he has found his level?\n\nMax Clifford, who we inexplicably need to hear from on a range of topics these days, says that Tiger Woods came across as genuine and sincere in his public address on Friday.\n\n\n\nAnd, compared to a guy like Clifford, he probably did.", "images":

A look at the stories that duped the public on April Fool's Day\n\n\n\nSportsmail's April Fool about West Ham United's new shirt sponsorship deal with erotic retailer Ann Summers caused uproar among the Hammers fans.\n\n\n\nApparently they didn't mind the new pink strip but couldn't take the humiliation of being publicly reminded that their club is now owned by David Sullivan and David Gold.\n\n\n\nIt was not the first time a story has upset the gullible public. Here Sporting Week presents six outrageous tales which struck a raw nerve. But which ones are an April Fool and which are the real deal?\n\nPretty in pink: West Ham will sex it up with a saucy Ann Summers strip next year\n\n*** John Terry to captain England at World Cup\n\nThis attempted newspaper scam was blown immediately when it became obvious that handing the armband to JT was simply far too much of a risk, even for the error-prone FA.\n\n\n\nWith his track record of off-the-field aberrations, the whole idea of Terry leading England out at the World Cup Finals was far-fetched in the extreme. Even PR spin depicting the multi-millionaire Chelsea centre half as 'Just your typical teammate and best friend next door' failed to convince sceptical readers.\n\n*** Fergie to quit Old Trafford\n\nA story that has been run many times in many guises since around 1986 - usually in the Liverpool Echo. This time it was given a ring of truth courtesy of the fact that Sir Alex was 107, although still retaining the youthful vigour and pent up frustration of a 14-year-old.\n\n*** FA sex up World Cup bid team\n\nTapping into the nation's feelings of mistrust and derision towards football's ruling body, this clever online campaign convinced many that changes really were afoot.\n\n\n\nThe new bid team would be spearheaded by figures thought to represent modern Britain more realistically - an ASBO laden teenager in a hooded top, a bulky Romanian single mother of seven in a pink shell suit and sheltered accomodation, and a 74-year-old benefits cheat who had not done a single day's work since going out on strike in 1974.\n\n*** Far-sighted 2012 Olympic legacy\n\nIn an audacious post-modern twist on the usual Olympic funding expose, a mischievous website claimed London's Olympic Park will be no white elephant and is to be redeveloped as a typical late-20th Century east end suburb once the celebration of sport is over.\n\n\n\n'The site will not go to waste, there will be a viable legacy for the people of London and indeed Britain,' an Olympic big-wig is quoted as saying.\n\n\n\nThe explosive piece of investigative 'journalism' went on to announce that the entire Olympic infra-structure will be knocked down and replaced by authentic terraced housing, local businesses and perhaps the odd park for kids to play in - at massive cost to tax payers and private investors alike.\n\nGuidance: Is Tiger Woods the right man to help encourage more women to play golf?\n\n\n\n*** Tiger Woods fronts campaign aimed at getting more young women involved in golf\n\nThe idea of Woods agreeing to lead this type of crusade proved difficult to stomach, even for his adoring golfing public. When has he ever had dealings with young women in golf? How could he know how they feel? Or how they might escape from a difficult lie.\n\n*** Tennis officials appoint chimp to captain Davis Cup team\n\nThis exclusive caused uproar on every Pimm's lawn across middle England as Piers and Clarissa could not understand what outgoing coach and former centre court pin-up David Lloyd had done wrong, apart from lose to Lithuania.\n\n\n\nIt caused uproar across the rest of the nation because nobody could understand why the British team needed a captain in the first place. They looked perfectly capable of losing to Lithuania on their own.\n\n\n\nIn the end the chimp was never required to don the team tracksuit and sit courtside because animal rights activists argued that this amounted to animal cruelty (not dressing the chimp up - making it watch the British team play).\n\nApparently there were further concerns for the chimp's freedom after a 30-minute practice session immediately revealed that he was far better at tennis than any of the team. Nature lovers argued that it would only be a matter of time before LTA officials coached the natural flair out of his game.", "images":

Ham boosted in Olympic Stadium battle with Tottenham as UK Athletics back bid", "text": "West Ham United boosted in Olympic Stadium battle with Tottenham as UK Athletics back Irons bid\n\n\n\nWest Ham's bid to take over the London Olympic stadium after the 2012 Games has received a major boost in the form of formal support by UK Athletics.\n\nThe Hammers, who have made a joint bid with Newham council, have committed to ensuring there is an athletics track as well as a football stadium.\n\nIt is a big blow to the rival joint bid from Tottenham and AEG, who had indicated a running track was not part of their future plans.\n\nEyes on the prize: The Olympic Stadium is taking shape in Stratford\n\nUK Athletics chairman Ed Warner said: 'What has impressed me so much about the joint bid from West Ham and Newham is their clear commitment to the spirit of the Olympic legacy and not just athletics at the elite end, but with the retention of the community track, our future champions and club runners too.\n\n'It was clear from the start that only a partnership approach would bring to life the vision Seb (Lord) Coe had when he committed to an athletics legacy in 2005 and we believe the collaboration of West Ham, Newham and UKA gives the strongest opportunity for a vibrant sporting legacy that will go well beyond 2012.'\n\nBattle: Hammers chief David Gold and vice-chairman Karren Brady\n\nWest Ham have also made clear their support for hosting the 2015 world athletics championships at the stadium - London is bidding against Beijing for the event.\n\nWarner added: 'The team at West Ham have also been keen to support our bid to host the World Athletics Championships in 2015 at the stadium, fully understanding that a significant international event will play a major part in realising their ambition of a British sporting hub.'\n\nLast week, AEG president Tim Leiweke said it would not make economic sense to keep the stadium geared up for athletics because of a small number of major events that could be staged at the venue.\n\nHow it will look: An artist's of how the stadium will sit in the new Olympic Park\n\nWest Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said: 'This is fantastic news. We believe ours is the only bid that can deliver London's legacy commitment to the International Olympic Committee. UKA's endorsement is a powerful and highly-valued testament of that.\n\n'Our plan is not just to have a new stadium for West Ham but a real sporting centre for London and the rest of the country. We want to create a home of sport, featuring two of the greatest sports, football and athletics, side by side where they can grow and flourish together.\n\nBack on track: West Ham's bid would assure an athletics legacy in Stratford\n\n'UKA have been great in helping us develop that vision over the past eight months and, together with Newham Council, we are ideally placed to make our dream a reality.\n\n'We now hope to move on and secure the stadium and enable world-class athletics to continue in east London beyond the Olympic Games - hopefully including the IAAF World Championships in 2015.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

Olympic legacy!\n\n\n\nBy Des Kelly for the Daily Mail\n\nSo the plan is to tear down a brand new Olympic stadium worth half a billion pounds after just three weeks of serious use and then build another ground on the same spot.\n\nThat has nothing to do with the word 'legacy'. That's vandalism.\n\nTottenham Hotspur's proposals for the main arena of the 2012 Games tell you everything you need to know about the swaggering arrogance and shameless opportunistic greed of modern football.\n\nNightmare vision: how the Olympic Stadium would look if Tottenham took it over after the 2012 Games\n\nFor Spurs to blithely announce that they will relocate to a part of east London that has nothing to do with them, flatten an 80,000-seat stadium, replace it with a new football-only facility that holds 60,000, even though thousands of their own fans oppose the move, is breathtaking in its conceit.\n\nBut this wrecking-ball diplomacy faces another obstacle. One of the key promises that Great Britain made when they won the right to host the 2012 Games was to guarantee the Olympic arena would retain an athletics track as part of London's ongoing legacy.\n\nFOLLOW DES ON TWITTER\n\nFollow the Sportsmail columnist HERE\n\nTottenham think they have found a crafty way around that. They say they will revamp the decrepit Crystal Palace site and athletics can continue to be catered for there. But if Palace were a prime location, it would hardly be in the state of disrepair and neglect it is now. The transport links are poor and the only way Crystal Palace might seriously be renovated is via the detonation of a small nuclear device. At least the Olympic venue would allow the nation's capital to host the World and European Athletics Championships in the years ahead.\n\nBesides, who the hell do Spurs think they are? Who are they to tell the sport of athletics where their ambitions would be better served?\n\nThis is a stadium that was essentially paid for with taxpayers' money and National Lottery funding. So it is our Olympic Stadium - and immediately knocking it down after the Games, a venue where history will be made, would be the height of philistinism.\n\nMoreover, how can Britain sneer at FIFA as they wriggle out of pledges and rewrite the Qatar 2022 World Cup plans without any discernible mandate if we cannot keep our promises on major events held here?\n\nSpin doctors say the move makes economic sense for Tottenham because they can earn around \u00a3150million from the new stadium naming rights.\n\nWell, whoop de doo. Frankly, nobody beyond those with Spurs' allegiances gives a javelin toss whether a Premier League club makes even more money or not.\n\nWill they get their hands on the stadium? David Gold and David Sullivan\n\nBut there is an alternative scenario to Tottenham's bulldozer plot. West Ham also hope to move up the road to the Olympic site.\n\nThey intend to retain the athletics track, much of the existing structure and allow the local community access to a multi-purpose stadium in partnership with Newham Council.\n\nNow I'm not exactly doing cartwheels about the Hammers' porn barons getting their hands on the ground either, and it is obvious that watching football across an athletics track can be an alienating compromise. But I'd still rather David Gold and David Sullivan had the place if it means locals and other sports are catered for and the athletics has somewhere better to call home after the Games than Crystal Palace.\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Board is due to announce its verdict at the end of this month. The clue as to how they must vote is in their name, where the words 'Olympic Legacy' figure prominently.\n\nSpurs don't really offer one of those. And we have to remember that sport in this country is not all about football, you know.\n\nBabel knows tweet FA about Twitter\n\n\n\nEveryone is getting all of a flutter about Twitter, imposing bans, fines and discussing censorship, but\n\nthe solution to all of the problems is really quite simple.\n\nWhenever I\u2019m asked by a public figure about the dos and don\u2019ts of this relatively new online phenomenon I tell them to remember this.\n\nTwitter. Is. Broadcasting.\n\nControversial: Ryan Babel (left) posted a mocked-up picture of Howard Webb on his Twitter page\n\n\n\nPeople forget. They think they\u2019re sending a text to a friend or posting an email to people they know.\n\n\n\nThey continue to believe this right up to the point when their sweary rant appears in banner headlines on the front page.\n\nThe basic rule is, if you wouldn\u2019t dare say it to a news camera, a journalist or via a megaphone from your open window, then it\u2019s best not to tweet it either.\n\nSo it\u2019s absolutely right that Ryan Babel is charged by the Football Association. The Liverpool player wouldn\u2019t roll into a press conference and announce, \u2018They call Howard Webb one of the best referees? That\u2019s a joke\u2019. Not without expecting a whopping fine, anyway.\n\nSo there\u2019s no reason that as a professional he should be allowed to publicly transmit the same statement to more than 170,000 followers on his Twitter page, plus the countless thousands more it\n\nwas forwarded to.\n\nBabel has admitted improper conduct and apologised, saying it was \u2018just an emotional reaction after losing an important game\u2019.\n\nIt is a civilised response, but it\u2019s no alibi for trashing any match official in public and he will have his knuckles quite rightly rapped by the FA.\n\nI know people get very po-faced about Twitter \u2014 because I was previously one of those people.\n\nWhen asked by the Daily Mail to start a page during the World Cup finals I really couldn\u2019t see the point. But after a few weeks, it became quite addictive.\n\nLike olives or Adrian Chiles, Twitter is an acquired taste. You have to sift out the dross, such as celebs who believe the fact they have made a cup of tea is some kind of world event.\n\nThat is easy enough and underneath the banality you find a lucky dip of random wit, instant knowledge and genuine breaking news.\n\nSo join in. We all slip up from time to time, but if people play nice it can be great fun. I\u2019ll stand by that\n\nendorsement right up until the point when I forget that bit about tweets not being texts and @P45_4U sends me my final message.\n\nRugger off Fabregas\n\n\n\nThere is nothing like losing with good grace and Cesc Fabregas clearly knows nothing about losing with good grace.\n\nI had been looking for an opportunity to praise the Arsenal captain for performing to a consistently high standard this season, especially as I had criticised the club\u2019s decision to retain him as skipper, unfairly as it turned out, following his aborted move to Barcelona in the summer.\n\nWhy couldn't he lose with good grace? Cesc Fabregas and Arsenal were a big disappointment at Portman Road\n\nBut in the wake of the defeat against Ipswich Town in midweek, Fabregas betrayed a churlishness that did him no credit, claiming Arsenal were only beaten in the first leg of the Carling Cup semi-final because of their opponents\u2019 rugby-style tactics.\n\nThis is becoming an increasingly tiresome theme from the Gunners. First Manchester City had the temerity to prevent them from scoring at the Emirates. Then Ipswich found perfectly legitimate ways to expose their vulnerable defence.\n\nRather than offer up unjustified gripes, Fabregas would have been better served concentrating on his own team\u2019s failings and pledging to set them right in the return, as sensible Gunners fans had already acknowledged.\n\nArsenal always play with class on the pitch, which makes it more of a shame when they cannot reach similar levels of refinement off it.\n\nHaving lost the Labour leadership contest to his brother, Arsenal supporter David Miliband is about to become vice-chairman of Sunderland Football Club, a position that pays him a further \u00a350,000 a year.\n\nI have another idea. Why doesn\u2019t Miliband just do the job WE pay him to do \u2014 as a full-time Member of Parliament?\n\nWriting a weekly sports column can be a perilous exercise. Last week, a colleague on a Sunday newspaper predicted \u2018Torres will relish his chance to give Vidic another nightmare\u2019 in a large headline across his page.\n\nLater the same day he discovered Vidic was not playing and although Torres was on the pitch he didn\u2019t really play either. The columnist was a chap called Kenneth Dalglish. I believe he has also found himself a second job.\n\nCalling amateur Sherlocks and Miss Marples. Olympic champion swimmer Mark Foster had three World Championship medals and one Commonwealth Games gong stolen from his car in London last month.\n\nEach one is engraved with his name. If you have any information that leads to their recovery, I\u2019m sure my friend can rustle up a suitable reward. Remember, the Olympics are coming, unless Spurs knock the stadium down in advance.\n\nContact me via Direct Message on Twitter or email in confidence.", "images":

"date": "15/01/2011"}, "rank_112": {"title": "Tottenham and West Ham fight for the 2012 venue... will the Olympic stadium end up in foreign hands?", "text": "While Tottenham and West Ham fight for the 2012 venue... will the Olympic stadium end up in foreign hands?\n\nThe \u00a3500million Olympic Stadium being built for next year's London Games could end up in foreign hands if the bid to take over the venue by Tottenham Hotspur succeeds.\n\n\n\nOpponents of the club's ambitions for the stadium claim that, despite construction costs being funded from tax revenues and Lottery money, the beneficiaries of a deal with Spurs could ultimately be a billionaire tax exile and investors from the ambitious Middle East state of Qatar.\n\n\n\nENIC, the investment company ultimately owned by Joe Lewis, who lives in the Bahamas, and chaired by Tottenham chief Daniel Levy, could pocket \u00a3200m by taking on the Olympic Stadium then selling Spurs to foreign owners.\n\n\n\nForeign land? Spurs' plans to take over Olympic stadium could lead to site falling into foreign hands\n\nWith Tottenham appointing spin doctor Mike Lee, who advised the successful Qatari World Cup bid for 2022, to argue their case, it is conceivable that the ultimate beneficiaries of the Olympic Stadium could be the Qatar Investment Authority, who would be a front runner to buy Spurs.\n\n\n\nTottenham are involved in an increasingly bitter battle with West Ham over which of the two clubs will win the right to move into the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Games.\n\n\n\nWhoever is successful would not own the stadium, which would be leased from the Olympic Park Legacy Company. But the tenant club would be able to exploit the venue for gain by, for example, selling naming rights worth around \u00a315m a year.\n\n\n\nBacking the bid: Tottenham chairman Levy and London 2012 deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills\n\nThey would also benefit from the infrastructure of the site, also funded by the taxpayer and Lottery money. While West Ham might ultimately be sold on to foreign owners, too, if they were the Olympic tenants, the stadium would be converted into a site for community use and would retain an athletics track.\n\nThat was the promise made by Britain's Olympic bid team when they won the contest six years ago to host the Games. Bizarrely, that bid team included both Lee and current Tottenham director Sir Keith Mills, both of whom are now arguing for the stadium pledge to be broken.\n\n\n\nDavid Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham who has had insider access to Spurs' owners and power-brokers during the bidding process for the Olympic Stadium, said: 'I've discussed this issue with Daniel Levy a number of times. He knows that my view, shared by most if not all fans, is that Tottenham should stay in Tottenham.\n\n\n\nTottenham v West Ham: The battle to move in after the games pt 1...\n\n\n\n1. What plans do the two clubs have for the Olympic Stadium? TOTTENHAM They want to knock most of it down, rip up the athletics track and build a 60,000-seat football stadium in which AEG, the American entertainment giant, can also stage concerts. WEST HAM They want to scale down the arena and add in commercial facilities as part of a 60,000-seat multi-sport stadium, retaining the athletics track.\n\n2. Would the clubs\u2019 plans for the stadium breach the pledge given for an Olympic legacy? TOTTENHAM\n\nUndoubtedly. When London won the right to stage the 2012 Olympics, the bid team promised \u2018a purpose-built home for athletics for generations to come\u2019.\n\nWEST HAM\n\nNo, and this is their main advantage. In keeping the athletics track and involving the community, they tick most of the right boxes.\n\n3. Where would the money for the stadium plans come from? TOTTENHAM From the sale of White Hart Lane, a potential share issue and \u00a335m from the Government - plus up to \u00a3150m over 10 years from naming rights. WEST HAM Newham Council will loan them \u00a380m (half of which will be repaid after Upton Park is sold), and the Government will provide another \u00a335m.\n\n\n\n'It's my fear that not only will the club move to the London Olympic site in Stratford, but that the move is being driven by money and not the best interests of the club.\n\n\n\n'Daniel has made it clear that it's about money, because we all know it will cost more to redevelop White Hart Lane (for around \u00a3450m) than to move to the Olympic Stadium (\u00a3250m).\n\n\n\n'But I fear this is just a step to making Spurs saleable. We've all heard the rumours about Middle East interest, perhaps from Qatar. I put it to Daniel that he wanted to move so he could sell up and he just blushed.'\n\n\n\nTottenham v West Ham: The battle to move in after the games pt 2...\n\n4. When would the stadium be ready for football? BOTH CLUBS Building work cannot start before spring 2013 and, while no moving-in date has been released, it would not be before 2014-15.\n\n5. How much would the competing plans cost? TOTTENHAM In the region of \u00a3250million, with around \u00a325m going to an athletics legacy by improving the Crystal Palace Stadium. WEST HAM Around \u00a3100m should pay for the work required to adapt the structure. 6. What is the Premier League\u2019s view of the rival bids? TOTTENHAM They would rubber-stamp the move despite a rule which covers clubs moving into rival territory. WEST HAM They would rubber-stamp the move.\n\nSpurs have said the move is not about 'chasing profit' but have stopped short of declaring that the club will not be sold within a certain time frame.\n\nSpurs could expect to be a more saleable asset in a 60,000- seat venue near the City of London than by staying in the north of the capital. The Qatari royal family, who backed the successful 2022 World Cup bid and have recently agreed a record shirt deal with Barcelona, are understood to be considering club options in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nA move to Stratford would be financially good for Spurs' owners, ENIC, not just because it would be cheaper than redeveloping in north London. It would also allow a lucrative fresh income stream from longterm naming rights, worth at least \u00a3150m.\n\n\n\nTottenham v West Ham: The battle to move in after the games pt 3...\n\n7. How would the fans be affected?\n\n\n\nTOTTENHAM\n\n\n\nThey would lose a key link to their heritage, have a name with no relation to their location and be too close to West Ham for comfort.\n\n\n\nWEST HAM\n\n\n\nThey might have a few empty seats for company on matchdays, bemoan a slight loss of identity and sit a lot further away from the pitch.\n\n8. What will the clubs do if they don\u2019t move to the Olympic Stadium? TOTTENHAM They may go back to their original plan of redeveloping White Hart Lane, although the \u00a3450m cost and poor transport links persist. WEST HAM Go back to the drawing board. The club have no firm plans to move anywhere else and will have to find a new way to pay off their debts of around \u00a380m. 9. What advantages can each bid claim? TOTTENHAM Their bid appears more secure financially, they have 34,000 people on a season ticket waiting list and should be able to offer Premier League football at least. WEST HAM They are the local club, can tap into a local fan base and have a plan that would be good for athletics and provide community facilities.\n\n\n\nCrucially, a move east would also mean ENIC and Levy could cash in on land sales around their current White Hart Lane ground, where the Tottenham Hotspur Property Company and eight property related subsidiaries have accumulated land.\n\n\n\nThe board of the Olympic Park Legacy Company will choose between Tottenham and West Ham on January 28. West Ham's bid would also be potentially profitable in the long term for their owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, again because of naming rights and because they would inherit a big new venue for a fraction of the cost it would take to build from scratch.\n\n\n\nThe key difference between the bids is that Spurs intend to bulldoze the Olympic Stadium and build another one without an athletics track, while West Ham intend to keep the track and leave an Olympics legacy on site.\n\n\n\nTottenham v West Ham: The battle to move in after the games pt 4...\n\n\n\n8. Who is in favour of the two clubs\u2019 bids? TOTTENHAM\n\n\n\nAEG and, presumably, some Spurs shareholders who like the idea of saving around \u00a3200m on the cost of redeveloping White Hart Lane. London 2012 deputy chairman Sir Keith Mills, a Spurs director, and Leyton Orient would also prefer Tottenham to move in rather than West Ham. Tottenham MP David Lammy opposes the Spurs plan. WEST HAM UK Athletics and event company Live Nation, who are bid partners, Essex County Cricket Club, Lord Coe, IOC president Jacques Rogge, the BOA, the IAAF and past and present athletes, including Daley Thompson, Steve Cram and Jessica Ennis.\n\n11. Are the fans in favour of moving to the Olympic Stadium? TOTTENHAM No. A group called We Are N17 have been founded to lobby against the move with protests, petitions and letters to key decision-makers. They have a strong online presence and object to moving out of the club\u2019s traditional base and a lack of consultation. WEST HAM Supporters are split with different polls producing contrasting results. There is a group against the move but there cannot be many who want Spurs to move in on their doorstep.\n\n\n\n\n\nEd Warner, chairman of UK Athletics, says the OPLC is 'morally obliged' to select West Ham's bid because it will keep the track, and reject what he calls the 'filthy lucre' of Tottenham, who have offered to refurbish Crystal Palace for athletics.\n\nSome football purists argue that a stadium with a track decreases the atmosphere. Rick Parry, the former Premier League and Liverpool chief executive, said: 'When you have a track you lose atmosphere, and the further from the pitch you are the less intimate the experience.'\n\n\n\nIf there is one sign that West Ham remain slight favourites with the OPLC, it came in a letter to Lammy, who asked the OPLC to 'detail the framework that will be used to make the decision'. One sentence in the reply cites 'elite sport' in a context that suggests something other than football. Only West Ham are offering that.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

advisor voices 'white elephant' fears", "text": "Spurs fans protest over Olympic Stadium move but Tottenham advisor voices 'white elephant' fears over Stratford site\n\n\n\nTottenham fans protested outside White Hart Lane on Sunday afternoon over the club's potential move to the Olympic Stadium, but the advisor to the club's bid to take over the stadium after the 2012 Games fears it will become 'a white elephant' if their proposal is rejected.\n\nFans gathered on Bill Nicholson Way more than three hours in advance of Spurs' Barclays Premier League match against Manchester United to vent their fury at the club's possible relocation to East London.\n\n\n\nAround 500 Spurs fans joined the protests leading to major disruption. Tottenham High Road had to be shut off just after 1pm with police on the scene. The players were forced to use a different entrance to the ground ahead of the 4.05pm kick-off.\n\n\n\nNo to Stratford: Spurs fans protest against the proposed plans to move the club into the Olympics site in east London after the 2012 Games\n\nSpurs are among those who have put themselves forward to take up the lease of the site, with a preferred bidder due to be announced later this month and a confirmed agreement drawn up by the end of March.\n\n\n\nThe club's plans are highly controversial as they want to demolish the stadium and rebuild another fit for football only. Such a proposal flies in the face of the promises made to the International Olympic Committee in 2005 prior to Britain being awarded the Games.\n\nAs part of then sports minister Tessa Jowell's speech to the IOC, she stated: 'The stadium will be a purpose-built home for athletics for generations to come, set in the biggest new urban park in Europe for 200 years.'\n\nHome sweet home: How the Olympic Stadium would look after Spurs' redevelopment\n\nMike Lee, part of the Olympics bid team six years ago and now the man assisting Spurs, has had a change of heart over the intervening period.\n\n\n\n'The key to this is sustainability and a viable legacy over time,' said Lee. 'What Spurs are proposing is to build a new stadium on that site, using much of what is already there, and to invest very heavily in the development and regeneration of the Crystal Palace stadium with real athletics legacy.\n\n'Spurs have begun to set out their ideas and plans. I personally feel it is the right way forward.'\n\nWhich way to go? West Ham are also competing to fill the stadium after 2012\n\nSpeaking on Radio 5 Live's, Lee added: 'What is the risk of this becoming a white elephant if it is a football and athletics combination with 60,000 seats?\n\n\n\n'I've looked at this long and hard and talked to a lot of expert people in the last six years, and there is a real danger of it becoming a white elephant.\n\n\n\n'It will take \u00a3100-150million to put a roof on, to put in permanent toilets, to put in hospitality, and no reconfiguration of the sightlines (towards the pitch).\n\n\n\n'It doesn't work for football. Football and athletics combinations do not work, it's not what football fans want.\n\n\n\n'So there is a danger of a white elephant being further subsidised by council tax payers, and that's not acceptable.'\n\nLee claims supporters would be 45 metres away from the action, yet rival bidders West Ham have confirmed their intention to retain the athletics track if they are allowed to relocate.\n\n\n\nNot long now: a confirmed agreement for a lease of the site is to be drawn up by the end of March\n\nEd Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, has admitted to being horrified when he was initially informed of Tottenham's plans a few weeks ago.\n\n\n\nWarner is firmly siding with West Ham, and said: 'The issue for me here is not about a home for athletics, it's about an Olympic track in an Olympic Stadium in an Olympic park.\n\n\n\n'I'm looking at the Olympic Park Legacy Company to deliver an Olympic legacy, not just a football legacy in that park, which will be for generations to come.\n\n\n\n'It's really going to be a community facility, and I believe that is what was planned all along.\n\n\n\n'I don't see what Olympic legacy there is in Tottenham's proposal. The track has to stay as an inspiration to young athletes for many generations ahead.\n\n\n\nStaying put: Hundreds of Tottenham supporters joined in protest at the club's controversial relocation plans\n\n'There is \u00a3500million of public money being spent on this stadium and it could disappear at the end of 2012, and I think that's a crying shame.\n\n\n\n'It's what was planned, a promise that has been made and I think all the politicians and the decision makers need to stand behind those promises.'\n\nLee insists he does not feel any guilt regarding his about turn, adding: 'The legacy was much broader than a specific stadium.\n\n\n\n'The legacy was about the regeneration of the East End, was about investment in sport across London, across the country, about inspiring young people. It wasn't about one sport.'\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

into graveyard says Harry Redknapp", "text": "Harry Redknapp: West Ham's plans for Olympic Stadium would turn it 'into a graveyard'\n\n\n\nTottenham manager Harry Redknapp has criticised West Ham's plans to retain an athletics track if they move to the Olympic Stadium, saying the venue would become a 'desolate graveyard'.\n\n\n\nRedknapp's current club are competing with the Hammers, who he managed from 1994 until 2001, for the right to move into the stadium in Stratford, east London, after the 2012 Games.\n\nWhile Spurs propose to transform the stadium into a football-only venue and redevelop the Crystal Palace athletics stadium, West Ham intend to retain the running track so that the stadium can be a multi-use site.\n\n\n\nPower struggle: West Ham and Tottenham are both set on a switch to the venue in Stratford\n\nRedknapp believes the Hammers' proposal would 'kill' the atmosphere at the stadium.\n\n\n\n'Try to mix football and athletics and you end up with a great big bowl of nothing,' Redknapp said in his column in The Sun.\n\n\n\n'The windblown no man's land between a pitch and the stands can kill football.'\n\n\n\nHe added: 'We keep hearing about the Olympic legacy and the need to have a world-class athletics stadium after the 2012 Games in London. But my big fear is that if West Ham move into a stadium in Stratford with a whacking great running track around the pitch, the only legacy for them will be a nightmare.\n\n\n\nThe future? Spurs' legacy as north London club would end with a move east\n\n'And what if West Ham are relegated this season and then find themselves in a 60,000-capacity stadium in a Championship match.\n\n\n\n'Can you imagine? Half the seats would be empty and it would become a desolate graveyard for a once-great club.\n\n'Look around the world - most foreign clubs with any sense are abandoning the combination stadium idea. Lots of German clubs experimented with it in the past and now they are being dug up and relaid with turf.\n\n\n\n'Stuttgart is one example where the club is moving to a whole new stadium to get back to the traditional layout of a football ground.\n\n\n\n'Upton Park was and still is one of the great grounds for atmosphere. These days it doesn't happen so often but on the big nights, especially for cup games, the place can rock. In the old days, you would actually see the fans swaying as they sang 'Bubbles' in the old Chicken Run.\n\n\n\nDesolate graveyard? If West Ham are relegated their players could be faced with swathes of empty seats\n\n'The only other place in football that could compare to it was Liverpool, when the fans sang 'You'll Never Walk Alone' on the Kop.\n\n\n\n'In contrast, Chelsea used to have a dog track around their pitch at Stamford Bridge and the place really struggled for atmosphere. It was so wide open and any atmosphere evaporated quickly.\n\n\n\n'Chelsea now have a tight, compact, steep-sided ground and the atmosphere is much better. White Hart Lane too is now totally closed in and the noise is terrific - among the best in the country.\n\n\n\n'Even if Spurs do win the race against West Ham to make it their new home, by the time all the development is finished I might not be at the club anyway.\n\n\n\n'It's just that in my heart I dread to think what could eventually happen to West Ham if they moved to the main Olympic Stadium and do not heed the warnings. I hate going to grounds where there is a running track to get past before you see Subbuteo-sized footballers through your opera-style binoculars.'\n\nThe president of the International Association of Athletics Federations Lamine Diack has warned that Britain's sporting reputation will be 'dead' if the Spurs proposal is accepted and the athletics track is removed.\n\n\n\nNo time to take chances: Redknapp has seen a number of clubs try and fail to make dual-use stadiums work\n\nThe Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) will today receive final submissions from Tottenham and West Ham, who would keep the athletics track, ahead of a likely decision next week.\n\nMeanwhile, Tottenham director Sir Keith Mills has stressed their bid for the Olympics Stadium would not leave London without an athletics track, following the criticism from Diack.\n\n\n\nHowever, Mills is not convinced a multi-purpose athletics and football stadium would be the right option from a financial point of view.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Four's Today programme, Mills - who is also the deputy chairman of LOCOG - said: 'Lamine Diack quite rightly wants to see the Olympic legacy left in London and both of the bids on the table provide an athletics legacy.\n\n\n\n'The issue here, and the one the OPLC will be looking at in the next 10 days, is what's going to provide the best long-term legacy for London and for the country.\n\n\n\n'And that's all about which of the two bids is going to be economically viable in the long term.\n\n\n\n'It's a difficult decision and we looked at during the bid whether an 80,000 seater stadium would work for a Premier League football club and determined that wouldn't work.\n\n\n\n'I could roll off a list of a dozen stadiums that have athletics tracks and that historically have had a list of football teams, but the football teams have all moved away because they don't work in multi-purpose built stadiums.\n\n\n\n'At the end of the day this is an economic argument. Someone has to pay for the next several decades for the stadium, and if West ham have found a way to work that economically, the OPLC will look on that favourably.\n\n", "images":

take legal action unless you let me vote for West Ham or Spurs", "text": "Tessa Sanderson warns Olympic Stadium chiefs: I'll take legal action unless you let me vote for West Ham or Spurs\n\n\n\nFormer Olympic champion Tessa Sanderson today threatened legal action unless she is reinstated to the vote to decide whether Tottenham or West Ham take over the Olympic Stadium after the London 2012 Games.\n\nI want a vote: And 1984 Olympic gold medal winner Tessa Sanderson will take legal action to get it\n\nSanderson says she has no conflict of interest and that the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC), of which she is a board member, should allow her to vote.\n\n\n\nThe 1984 javelin gold medalist was told by OPLC chief executive Andrew Altman this week that she would be excluded from the vote due to a conflict of interest because she has a personal consultancy contract with Newham Council, who are West Ham's partners, and that the contract had not been disclosed.\n\n\n\nSanderson said: 'I want to be back on there making the decision and I hope it doesn't come to it but I am willing to take legal action if necessary.'\n\nThe 54-year-old is the founder and head of the Newham Sports Academy (NSA) which is funded by the council, but she says she is not a director.\n\nSanderson added: 'I have absolutely no conflict of interest. As a local resident and former Olympic gold medallist I believe I am ideally placed to contribute to deciding what is the best long future for the site and I remain objective and open-minded to the two proposals which I believe the board will receive over the coming days.\n\n'My involvement with Newham has been well documented in the national and local media over the last four years and clearly is in the public domain, indeed you only have to look at my own entry on the OPLC website to see my ongoing involvement.\n\n\n\n'I have been a member of the OPLC Board since its inception and have always been up front and honest about my involvement with the NSA, never knowingly hiding or not disclosing any relevant information or interests and was recently even asked to provide a written brief on the NSA initiative for the OPLC Chairman Baroness Margaret Ford for the House of Lords.\n\n\n\nUp for grabs: The Olympic Stadium\n\n'Anyone who knows me knows that I am absolutely committed, passionate and determined to secure a proper and sustainable Olympic Legacy for East London for future generations.'\n\nSanderson said repeated demands for a detailed explanation of her exclusion from the vote had not been answered.\n\nShe said: 'I have asked the OPLC chief executive to provide me with a full written\n\nexplanation on his decision and despite my repeated requests this has not been

two years ago", "text": "2012 Olympic Stadium legacy expert left two years ago\n\nSPORTS AGENDA\n\nThere should be huge concern that the No 1 sports legacy expert appointed to oversee the post-2012 future of the Olympic Stadium has played no part in the process for nearly two years.\n\nTom Russell was hand-picked as executive director for Olympic Legacy by the London Development Agency in January 2008 after he had masterminded the seamless conversion of the City of Manchester Stadium from athletics to football after the Commonwealth Games.\n\n\n\nYet he is now working as a consultant in the North West with no sporting ties apart from being a season-ticket holder at Manchester City.\n\n\n\nCentre of attention: Tottenham and West Ham are involved in a high-profile bid battle to occupy the Olympic Stadium after 2012\n\nHe left his Olympic position in April 2009 by mutual consent after not being selected as chief executive of the Olympic Park Legacy Company which he had recommended being formed.\n\n\n\nRussell had alienated the influential figures in the Olympic Delivery Authority and London 2012 with his views about football and athletics being incompatible and the only way of attracting a Barclays Premier League club to Stratford was to build a dedicated football stadium.\n\n\n\nRussell reached that view after no sports tenant wanted to occupy a reduced 25,000-seat stadium and neither Tottenham nor West Ham had any interest at that time in a venue with a running track.\n\n\n\nHe believed a stable long-term legacy solution was more important than the track and field promises made to the IOC provided London had a world-class athletics facility.\n\n\n\nEngland cricket team chief Andy Flower, whose side are out on their feet in Australia, won't be happy about the promise given to counties by the England and Wales Cricket Board last week that centrally contracted players will be made available for more cricket next season.\n\nThe games in which the England cricketers can play has yet to be finalised, but Flower, who said he would address the issue after the Ashes, will be against any extra commitments.\n\n\n\nConnected to this is the ECB needing to provide Sky with further cricket attractions after their demand for a rebate on their \u00a3240m contract followed the collapse of the Stanford Twenty20 series and the English equivalent of the Indian Premier League.\n\n\n\nNew England team sponsors Vauxhall, still highly unimpressed with the way the FA barred manager Fabio Capello from answering media questions at their launch event, will be demanding they receive proper value in future for their \u00a35million-plus-a-year investment from the personal appearances outlined in their contract.\n\n\n\nVauxhall are understood to have around 12 player and two manager appearances per season outside international weeks in their agreement and will be asking for marquee names - not the fringe players that other sponsors have often had to put up with on such occasions.\n\n\n\nSpurs have us believe the commercially rapacious Pele, who is happy to endorse Viagra provided Pfizer pay him millions, gave his letter of support for their Olympic Stadium bid for free.\n\n\n\nThe club's link with this English football expert - he thought Michael Owen played for Manchester United in 2002 - was through former Spurs director Paul Kemsley, who has revived the New York Cosmos for whom Pele is the president.\n\n\n\nParis bid's inside track?\n\nPulling down the Olympic Stadium to accommodate Tottenham's dedicated football build would allow the beaten Paris 2012 bid to claim 'I told you so'.\n\n\n\nWhen examining the London bid book at a meeting in April 2005, senior French bid officials predicted their rivals would renege on their athletics legacy promise for Stratford.\n\n\n\nFollow Charles Sale's updates on Twitter\n\ntwitter.com/charliesale\n\nThe Russians are prepared to spend \u00a320m on their design for a London Olympic hospitality venue at Marble Arch, which is subject to police, transport and Westminster Council consultancy processes.\n\n\n\nAlong with showcasing Sochi 2014, it would allow them to promote the Russian 2018 World Cup.\n\nAnd no doubt FIFA president and IOC member Sepp Blatter, whom London Mayor Boris Johnson wanted to block from staying at the nearby Dorchester Hotel, will be a VIP guest.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

Stadium in 2012 rise as research exposes legacy myth", "text": "Tottenham's 2012 hopes rise as research exposes Olympic legacy myth\n\nBy Nick Harris for The Mail on Sunday\n\nTottenham hope that research highlighting the failure of athletics legacies at the main Olympic stadiums used for the past 10 Games can help them defeat West Ham in the battle for the London 2012 venue.\n\nInsiders say the Olympic Park Legacy Company are planning a pivotal board meeting for Friday when a decision is likely over which Premier League club will become the tenants at London's showpiece arena after 2012.\n\nS019 NAT 0602 (READ ONLY).jpg\n\nWest Ham have promised to retain the athletics track - honouring a pledge made to the International Olympic Committee when London were awarded the Games six years ago.\n\n\n\nTottenham have offered to refurbish Crystal Palace for athletics and say they are the only club that can offer a viable, lucrative, long-term return to the Treasury as tenants.\n\nThe OPLC, who have to pick between the two, delayed a decision last month after requesting more information.\n\n\n\nSpurs' subsequent submission includes a report by stadium management specialists International Stadia Group (ISG), who were themselves former bidders to manage the London venue.\n\nISG's chief, Andrew Hampel, assessed the legacies of the 10 Olympic stadiums used at summer Games between Munich 1972 and Beijing 2008.\n\n\n\nHe says: 'We've worked on projects like this around the world, including Wembley and now Rio, and the bottom line is an ideal stadium is configured for its primary sport. The less good the experience for the fans, the less chance of success.'\n\nNo athletics event has been held at the Munich 1972 stadium since that year, while the post-Games football tenants, Bayern Munich and Munich 1860, have since moved.\n\n\n\nMontreal's 1976 stadium has hosted gridiron, baseball, football and concerts but has no permanent tenant.\n\n\n\nMoscow's 80,000-seat 1980 Games venue has been Spartak's football home and hosted the Champions League final of 2008.\n\n\n\nSuper bowlr: But will the Olympic Stadium become just another white elephant?\n\nIt will finally get to host a major athletics event in 2013 - the World Championships - after 33 years. The running tracks have been removed or are not used at Los Angeles (1984), Seoul (1988), Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000).\n\n\n\nBarcelona's 1992 stadium was used for football by Espanol, but they moved out in 2009 to a purpose-built home.\n\n\n\nThe 2004 Athens stadium is AEK's football home, while Beijing's Bird's Nest will host the 2015 athletics World Championships before becoming a shopping and entertainment complex.\n\n\n\nTottenham chairman Daniel Levy urged the decision to be made 'on sound financial criteria, not by political forces'.\n\n\n\nHe added: 'If you have a stadium which is athletics and soccer together and as a consequence it is not full, it will affect economic viability and end up being a white elephant. It is only a matter of time.'\n\n\n\nBut West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady said: 'The world's great athletes are horrified at Spurs' scheme to blast the \u00a3500m stadium into oblivion and replace it with a football-only building.\n\n\n\n'Flattening the stadium would be an act of corporate vandalism.'\n\n\n\n", "images":

a 'corporate crime' to knock down Olympic stadium", "text": "West Ham chief Brady blasts Spurs: It would be a 'corporate crime' to knock down London's Olympic stadium\n\n\n\nWest Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady claims it would be a 'corporate crime to bring the bulldozers in' and demolish the Olympic Stadium at the end of the 2012 Games for Tottenham to build a new home.\n\nBut Spurs chairman Daniel Levy branded her comments 'scaremongering and irresponsible'.\n\nBoth the Hammers and their Barclays Premier League rivals are bidding to take over the venue once the Olympics have finished.\n\nWar of words: West Ham vice chairman Karren Brady and Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy\n\n\n\nHowever, while West Ham would retain the athletics track as part of the commitment to legacy, Spurs would instead tear down the stadium and build a new football-only venue.\n\nA decision on the future of the Olympic Park site is expected later this week, having been initially delayed from January 28 to allow more time to consider the rival bids.\n\nBrady, however, is in no doubt tearing down the stadium just does not make sense.\n\n'It's a corporate crime to spend \u00a3500m on a stadium and, just four weeks after the Games have finished, bring the bulldozers in,' Brady told BBC Breakfast.\n\nLeague One club Leyton Orient fear for their long-term future should a Premier League club move within striking distance of their Brisbane Road home, while the Olympic Park Legacy Company also has a third option of converting the stadium into a 25,000-seat mixed-use venue for sporting, cultural and community events.\n\nIAAF president Lamine Diack, who is also a member of the International Olympic Committee member, maintains Britain's reputation will be \"dead\" if an athletics legacy is not left at the Olympic Stadium, with both London 2012 chairman Lord Coe and former Olympics minister Tessa Jowell throwing their weight behind West Ham's bid, which is a joint venture with Newham Council.\n\nBrady added: 'The Olympic Stadium was built on a promise, made in the Queen's name, to have a legacy for athletics.\n\n'Through [West Ham's] design there will be over \u00a390m spent on reconfiguring the stadium so it sits perfectly for athletics and football and cricket and major events.\n\nLondon calling: Who will play in Stratford after the 2012 Olympics?\n\n'Once the conversion is done, with the roof and some of the seats, there won't be a single seat within that stadium that has a worse view of the pitch than Wembley.'\n\nIf successful, Tottenham, joint bidders with sports and entertainment company AEG, intend to contribute to the refurbishment of the National Sports Centre at Crystal Palace.\n\nTottenham chairman Daniel Levy responded to Brady later on Monday.\n\nIn a statement, he said: 'A lot of emotive phrasing has been used regarding the dismantling of the stadium and it is scaremongering and irresponsible.\n\n'If we look at the facts, the Olympic stadium as we now see it was never intended to be kept. The original 2012 legacy promised to dismantle all of the stadium above ground leaving a sunken 25,000-capacity athletics arena - that has proved unviable.\n\n'Our plans involve the same amount of dismantling and this is in no way a loss of \u00a3500million of stadium infrastructure.\n\n'Given how much of the original groundworks, substructure and podium will remain, around \u00a3420million worth, we are talking about \u00a380million of above-ground infrastructure - all of which will be recycled or re-used.\n\n'Additionally, our bid sees a return to the public purse which far exceeds this figure and our bid does not require any public sector funding.'\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

Daniel Levy hits back over Olympic Stadium 'crime' slur", "text": "Karren Brady's words are nothing but scaremongering - Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy hits back over Olympic Stadium 'crime' slur\n\nWest Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady stoked the club's war of words with Tottenham, their rival bidders for the Olympic Stadium, by accusing them of trying to commit a 'corporate crime' in seeking to raze the showpiece arena.\n\n\n\nWith the Olympic Park Legacy Company expected to announce towards the end of this week who will take over the stadium post- 2012, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy retaliated by labelling the criticism 'scaremongering and irresponsible'.\n\nTwo-way battle: A decision is on the preferred bidder to take over the stadium is expected on Friday\n\nWest Ham's bid is based on the promise to keep a running track at the stadium, fulfilling in part the pledge made by 2012 chairman Lord Coe to the International Olympic Committee to retain an athletics legacy in London's East End.\n\nTottenham want to knock down the stadium, turning it into a football ground and redeveloping Crystal Palace in south London for track and field use.\n\n\n\nBrady said: 'It's a corporate crime to spend \u00a3500million on a stadium and just four weeks after the Games bring the bulldozers in.\n\n\n\nThe stadium was built on a promise, made in the Queen's name, to have a legacy for athletics.\n\nNo love lost: Levy (left) and Brady (right) have clashed publicly in recent weeks\n\n'Through our design there will be over \u00a390m spent on reconfiguring the stadium so it sits perfectly for athletics and football and cricket and major events.'\n\n\n\nLevy said: 'We are building a stadium that will cost the taxpayer nothing in the long term. A lot of emotive phrasing has been used regarding the dismantling of the stadium and it is scaremongering and irresponsible.\n\n\n\n'The Olympic Stadium as we now see it was never intended to be kept. The original 2012 legacy promised to dismantle all of the stadium above ground leaving a sunken 25,000-capacity athletics arena, but that has proved unviable.\n\n", "images":

2012 figure Mike Lee", "text": "Forget West Ham's 'white elephant' bid! Tottenham must move into Olympic Stadium, insists key London 2012 PR figure Lee\n\n\n\nMike Lee insists the Tottenham bid with which he is involved would rule out the Olympic Stadium becoming a 'white elephant' after the 2012 Games - and that 'football and athletics don't work as a combination'.\n\n\n\nLee was a key figure in London's successful bid to host the Games, alongside Sebastian Coe, but the pair have found themselves on opposite sides in the debate over how best to ensure a legacy for the centrepiece venue.\n\n\n\nWest Ham are also in the running to inhabit the stadium once the Games are over and would keep the running track as part of a 60,000-capacity stadium. Tottenham, meanwhile, would demolish the track and bid to contribute to an athletics legacy elsewhere by helping to redevelop Crystal Palace.\n\n\n\nPark life: Tottenham wanted to build a new stadium on the Olympic Park\n\nWhile Coe has publicly backed West Ham's bid on the basis that he feels a 'moral obligation' to retain a multi-sports venue, Lee - a former Hammers board member - is advising Spurs in their rival bid.\n\n\n\n'If you're not in a great football stadium it affects your experience and your willingness to come week in, week out,' he told the Guardian, speaking of West Ham's proposals.\n\n'The long-term future of athletics is also important. And we know that football and athletics don't work as a combination. Bayern Munich didn't have a great time in their Olympic stadium and athletics hasn't really worked there since the [1972] Games. Espanyol were also happy to move out of Barcelona's Olympic Stadium.\n\n\n\n'I genuinely think London has an opportunity to create the greatest Olympic Park ever. I'm not saying it's a simple decision. But if you duck difficult decisions when it comes to the legacy of these great sporting events you're in danger of creating a white elephant. In Olympic history those cities that have ducked difficult decisions have ended up regretting it.\n\n\n\nOn track: Spurs vow to rebuild Crystal Palace National Sports Centre to leave a legacy for athletics\n\n'The Spurs and AEG link is economically very strong. I've long been convinced their combination, coupled with Spurs' pledge to build an athletics venue at Crystal Palace, is the best solution.\n\n\n\nPoll Who should move into the Olympic Stadium after 2012? West Ham Tottenham Who should move into the Olympic Stadium after 2012? West Ham 3967 votes\n\nTottenham 2892 votes Now share your opinion\n\n\n\n\n\n'One of the reasons why the story matters to me personally is that the West Ham board I advised wanted the Olympic Stadium to be built with retractable seats - so you could have a purpose-built stadium with the flexibility to host athletics. We believed you had to have a bespoke football stadium for a Premier League club.\n\n\n\n'Even before any contact with Spurs I thought, \"My goodness, that looks a sensible solution - as long as they also provide an athletics legacy.\" If Spurs had come to this bid without their Crystal Palace athletics proposal I could not have worked with them.'\n\n\n\nLee was also involved with Rio de Janeiro's successful bid for the 2016 Olympics and again as Qatar were awarded the 2022 football World Cup, but admits his experience has not helped him predict whether Spurs will be successful this time around.\n\n\n\nDecision time: West Ham are expected to be confirmed as the preferred bidder\n\n'In these campaigns you're never quite sure,' he said. 'If you look at London, Rio and Qatar, I didn't feel sure until the envelope had been opened and the name announced.\n\n", "images":

battle", "text": "Sullivan slams Spurs in Olympic Stadium battle as West Ham co-owner hits back\n\nBy Sportsmail Reporter\n\nWest Ham co-chairman David Sullivan insists West Ham want 'to give something back to the community' as their battle with Tottenham over the 2012 Olympic Stadium intensified.\n\n\n\nThe clubs have been engaging in an increasingly bitter war of words over who should win the right to move to the stadium once the 2012 Games are over.\n\n\n\nSpurs chairman Daniel Levy has warned that West Ham's plan to keep the running track would 'guarantee' the Stratford stadium would become a white elephant.\n\n\n\nA glimpse of the future: How West Ham see the development of the Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games\n\nHammers vice-chairman Karren Brady, meanwhile, claimed last weekend Tottenham's plan to tear down the \u00a3537million publicly-funded stadium and replace it with a 60,000-seater football ground was a 'corporate crime'.\n\n\n\nSullivan took the criticism to new heights though when he accused Tottenham's billionaire owner Joe Lewis of pursuing a move to the stadium in order to make money for himself.\n\n\n\nSullivan insists only he and Hammers co-owner David Gold, both West Ham fans who were both brought up in East London, have the area's best interests at heart. Sullivan told ESPNsoccernet: 'The motive of myself and my partner David Gold is to give something back to the community we came from and are still a part of.\n\n\n\nPoll Who should move into the Olympic Stadium after 2012? West Ham Tottenham Who should move into the Olympic Stadium after 2012? West Ham 3967 votes\n\nTottenham 2892 votes Now share your opinion\n\n\n\n\n\n'The Olympic Stadium will motivate and regenerate East London and Essex. We are proud to use our money to be a part of it. It works for West Ham United and all of London.\n\n\n\n'Daniel Levy's sole argument seems to be that, in his opinion, the stadium won't work with West Ham United as the tenants. We beg to differ. What we know won't work is having a north London club having a stadium in the borough where we have been for over 100 years. It doesn't feel right, as it isn't right. Any right-minded person would agree with us.'\n\nBoth clubs have been busy trying to get backing for their respective bids this week ahead of the Olympic Park Legacy Company's (OPLC) decision on who should occupy the stadium.\n\n\n\nThat decision, which would see Spurs move around five miles from their current home if successful, is expected some time this month.\n\n\n\nSullivan used his column in the London Evening Standard today to hit back at Levy's claims emotion should not play a part in who the OPLC choose as their preferred bidder.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'Spurs claimed the other day that the decision should not be based on emotion. I disagree. \"Emotion can often drive a financial plan forward. The legacy of the Olympic Stadium affects us all. We have paid our taxes and have a vested interest in what happens after 2012.\n\n\n\nLocal stadium for local people: West Ham co-owners David Sullivan (left) and David Gold\n\n'People who want to take the emotion out of the East End clearly need a history lesson or two. We have our field of dreams at last and no-one should be allowed to take it away.'\n\nSpurs insist they are committed to maintaining a post-Olympics athletics legacy in London by refurbishing Crystal Palace.\n\n\n\nBut Sullivan believes West Ham's plan to hold athletics meetings at the Olympic Stadium after 2012 is the only way of ensuring London will have a world-class athletics venue after the Games.\n\n\n\nThe West Ham co-chairman also rejected Levy's suggestion the stadium would become a white elephant.\n\n\n\nHe added: 'West Ham are the only ones proposing to stay true to the Olympic legacy with a running track in the stadium and we know it will work.\n\n\n\n'I keep reading about 'white elephants' but the only elephant in the room is the one that suggests it is okay to rip up the track and bulldoze the Olympic Stadium to the ground - and in its place build a run of the mill football stadium, for a club that is over 10 miles away from the East End. Now, that would be crazy.'\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

But Lionel Messi is so good he\u2019s the exception to the rule. I wouldn\u2019t have a clue how much he\u2019d be worth in today\u2019s market, it is impossible to evaluate in monetary terms.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t just be buying a footballer, more an institution. He\u2019s not only got a value as a player who has scored 40 goals already this season and probably created the same number again. He\u2019s also got a value to Barcelona in terms of profile, merchandising and a symbol of the entire club.\n\nPriceless: Lionel Messi has already scored 37 goals this season\n\nI\u2019ve heard \u00a3100million mentioned but that would be a snip. If you offered it, you wouldn\u2019t get him. Think about it, 40 goals by February. The statistics are mind-boggling. As long as the club is running, Barcelona will want to keep him.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I\u2019m as excited by everyone else at the prospect of Arsenal- Barcelona this week. It\u2019s always a privilege to welcome someone like Messi to England.\n\nHe\u2019s the best player in the world and it won\u2019t be lost on Arsene Wenger that Messi\u2019s closest challengers \u2014 Xavi and Andres Iniesta \u2014 also play for Barca. Their 5-0 win against Real Madrid has to rank as the best club performance I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n\n\nWhat I like particularly about him is how he manages to carry a huge air of confidence without being arrogant. You always sense he appreciates what he\u2019s doing; he enjoys putting a smile on people\u2019s faces and he has done that for millions of people.\n\nMessi was just a teenager when I first saw him live, playing for Barcelona at Chelsea in 2006, the year they won the Champions League. He stood out to me immediately because he was 18, in a Champions League semi-final and didn\u2019t have a trace of fear in him.\n\nArsenal have been hugely unlucky in drawing Barcelona, it was the worst draw they could have got. Inter Milan showed last year you can beat them over two legs as it\u2019s not guaranteed that the best team with the best players will win.\n\nBut it must be difficult to stop them playing, every one of them is good in possession and the movement is fantastic. It can be done but you need a great deal of resolve. Arsene Wenger won\u2019t change his philosophy of playing, but he might alter his formation.\n\nThe truth is that nobody plays the Barcelona way better than they do. So if you take them on at their own game, they win. It is the contrasting team that might cause them problems, as Inter did last year.\n\n\n\nIt may be that the power of Chelsea or Manchester United might cause Barcelona more problems than Arsenal and I\u2019d like to see what Tony Pulis would come up with if Stoke played Barcelona \u2014 and how Barca would cope with that.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll be interested to see how Jack Wilshere does in such exalted company after his impressive performance for England against Denmark. Fabio Capello used him as a holding midfield player, which isn\u2019t his best position, but that doesn\u2019t mean his long-term England future is there.\n\nComing of age: Jack Wilshere (second right) impressed against Denmark - but how will he fare against Barcelona?\n\nIt was a nice way of getting him involved in international football in a position where he would get a bit more time and space on the ball.\n\n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t in the firing line further up the pitch and as an experiment it served its purpose as it allowed him to get a feel for what it\u2019s like to play for England at the right pace. Wenger doesn\u2019t use him like that.\n\nLong-term, Wilshere will be best served in a rotating midfield \u2014 there is no need to tie him down as a holding midfielder. Arsenal can use Alex Song or Abou Diaby in that role and let Wilshere and Fabregas play.\n\n\n\nNothing fazes Wilshere and coming up against Barcelona will be a terrific education. He will face three guys of similar physical stature to himself \u2014 Messi, Xavi and Iniesta \u2014 and it will emphasise again that you don\u2019t have to be 6ft 4in and built like Arnold Schwarzenegger to flourish in the modern game.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a fantastic night\u2019s entertainment. We may as well all enjoy Messi. He\u2019s priceless.\n\nClub versus country: Gerrard was withdrawn from the England squad with a groin injury\n\n\n\nFA must use common sense with injury concerns\n\n\n\nUnder the current rules, the FA are allowed to check on a player\u2019s injury if a club want to withdraw him from an international squad.\n\nBut nobody seems to have questioned the sense of a player with a muscular injury travelling all the way to London to have it checked out by the England doctor.\n\nWhat if the travelling affects the injury? Will the FA compensate clubs? If the FA want to check on players, they have to take responsibility.\n\n\n\nIt would make more sense to have FA medical people in each region to take away the hassle of players having to travel. We were fortunate last week in that we had played at Chelsea so Steven Gerrard didn\u2019t have to make an extra trip for his injury to be checked out.\n\nThere is no easy answer to club versus country issues. But the solution lies in the integrity of all parties. If an international side don\u2019t trust the diagnosis of a club doctor, are they not questioning the club\u2019s integrity?\n\nI can understand why an international team might want to carry out their own checks, but surely they can make it more practical by allowing that to be done in any part of the country rather than expecting players who are carrying injuries to make unnecessary 400-mile round trips.\n\nYoungsters need affordable sporting facilities\n\n\n\nMy idea of an Olympic legacy is to ensure young athletes have the chance to use excellent facilities at an affordable price. It\u2019s why the West Ham bid made more sense than the Spurs one.\n\nIf the running track was taken away, London would have reneged on the legacy pledge made when they won the 2012 bid, and used taxpayers\u2019 money to build the stadium.\n\n\n\nTrue, the running track creates less atmosphere than when the punters are on top of you. But neither is it \u2018totally flawed\u2019, in the words of Lord Sugar, to have a track at a football stadium.\n\nOlympic legacy: West Ham must make sure they provide affordable sporting facilities for youngsters\n\nThe old Wembley had greyhound lanes around the perimeter of the pitch and the fans still used to love going there. My scepticism is over whether the notion of legacy will be forgotten once West Ham have got their feet under the table.\n\nThe stadium was built with pledges attached. It was planned to be for the long-term development of young athletes, not for the sole benefit of West Ham.\n\nIt makes sense for the stadium to be used and having a football club there helps. But I can\u2019t see West Ham playing to full houses every week in a 60,000-seater stadium.\n\nThey have a part to play in the stadium\u2019s future, but they can\u2019t overrule its original purpose. I\u2019m not sure if the running track will be there five years after West Ham move in, but if that is what we promised the International Olympic Committee, then it should be.\n\n\n\nYou are an intelligent lot, so maybe somebody can tell me this. If West Ham are to share the Olympic stadium with athletes, is there not a chance that a javelin thrower will pierce the undersoil heating?\n\n", "images":

into Orient's patch", "text": "West Ham to face Olympic Stadium fight over moving into Orient's patch\n\nBy Nick Harris for The Mail on Sunday\n\nWest Ham's dream of taking over London's Olympic Stadium after the 2012 Games will come under threat this week when Leyton Orient announce they are considering legal action over the decision to allow the Hammers to move from Upton Park to Stratford as the venue's tenants.\n\n\n\nRather than challenge the decision of the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC), which on Friday selected West Ham over Tottenham as the preferred bidder for the stadium, Orient will focus on the legality of the Premier League allowing one of their clubs to relocate into the 'territory' of a Football League club.\n\nOn yer bike: Orient set to challenge West Ham over future of Olympic Stadium\n\nOrient will outline their objections at a Press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIt is understood that the League One club will demand details about what specific impact studies the Premier League undertook to gauge the impact on Orient of a move to Stratford by either West Ham or Tottenham.\n\n\n\nPremier League Rule I.6.5, which governs stadium moves, states that the Premier League's board should agree to a change of home for one of their clubs only if the board are satisfied that a move 'would not adversely affect clubs (or Football League clubs) having their registered grounds in the immediate vicinity of the proposed location'.\n\n\n\nOrient, the closest club to the Olympic site, believe that no meaningful impact studies have been done and they fear that West Ham's intended discount pricing policy will severely damage their own attendance and income.\n\n\n\nIt is expected that West Ham will offer cheap admission prices to try to fill the reconfigured 60,000-seat stadium, undercutting Orient's current ticket charges.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

effect while the potential clash of interests is investigated.\n\n\n\nInternal investigation: Olympic Park Legacy Company chiefs will probe its stadium procedures in light of the recent West Ham claims\n\nThe OPLC board, in charge of securing the future of the Olympic Park site, voted 14-0 in February to make the Hammers the first choice to move into the \u00a3486million stadium. The Hammers were in a head-to-head contest with Tottenham.\n\n\n\nAn OPLC statement read: 'The Olympic Park Legacy Company has launched an independent investigation into its internal stadium procedures as a result of the allegations made concerning employee Dionne Knight.\n\n\n\n'The auditors Moore Stephens have been appointed to carry out this investigation into our procedures. They have put together a team led by their specialist forensic unit.\n\n\n\nHammer time: West Ham are due to occupy the Olympic Stadium in 2014\n\n'We are also investigating the nature of the consultancy work that Dionne Knight undertook without our knowledge or permission. An independent barrister will be instructed to conduct the employment elements of this investigation.\n\n", "images":

correct and expensive nonsense", "text": "Gold medal for lunacy! Brace yourself for the 'cultural Olympics' an orgy of politically correct and expensive nonsense\n\n\n\nBarmy: The Cultural Olympiad received \u00a316million of lottery funding\n\nThe most eagerly anticipated event in next year\u2019s Olympics \u2014 the men\u2019s 100m final \u2014 will be over in less than ten seconds. The entire Games, which begin almost exactly a year from now, will last only 17 days.\n\nBut there is a sideshow to the sporting events that has already been groaning on for three years \u2014 even though few people have heard of it \u2014 and which will not finish until after the last athlete has returned home.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t yet come across the Cultural Olympiad, it won\u2019t be long before you receive an invitation to watch this \u2018cultural feast\u2019: it might be in the form of schoolchildren waving flags, a large inflatable object floating down a river or some other event supposed to \u2018inspire creativity\u2019 and \u2018leave a lasting legacy for the arts in Britain\u2019.\n\nThe arts, we are always being told, have never had it so tough. Certainly, there might be some truth in that if you are running an orchestra or a much-loved local theatre, hard hit by the recent Arts Council cuts.\n\nBut if you want to get together a few hundred people to fly kites and explore issues of migration and global warming, there seems to be no shortage of cash.\n\nIn 2009, the Cultural Olympiad received \u00a316 million of Lottery money, much of which has been spent already. There is also funding from private sponsors including BP and BT, and the taxpayer-funded Arts Council, which has 13 so-called \u2018creative programmers\u2019 \u2014 each overseeing a region of the UK \u2014 who have decided which projects to support in the run-up to the Games.\n\nBut what are we getting for all this money? (And we shouldn\u2019t forget that when the Lottery was established it was supposed to fund useful social projects, not fritter away cash on politically correct nonsense.)\n\nIn the West Midlands, the money is being spent on a giant puppet of Lady Godiva that will be driven to London \u2018dressed for her journey into the 21st century in a coat crafted by local artists chronicling the West Midlands industrial and engineering heritage\u2019.\n\nFinal preparations: The Olympic games are just a year away and despite a tight budget extra cash has been found for the 'cultural Olympics'\n\nAll very splendid, I am sure, except that it misses the whole point of the story of Lady Godiva, who rode naked through the streets of Coventry.\n\nThat aside, no one seems to have the first idea of what this has to do with the Olympics.\n\nIn London, more money has been spent as part of the Cultural Olympiad installing LED displays on the roofs of bus shelters, apparently \u2018to breathe new life into all corners of the capital, transforming the previously unloved tops of bus shelters into a London-wide digital canvas\u2019.\n\nJust one problem: unless you happen to live or work in a tall building with a bus stop directly outside it, you won\u2019t be able to see any of these \u2018installations\u2019.\n\nIn East Anglia, a series of large-scale events involving as many people as possible will be recorded to create a feature film \u2018exploring the themes of trade, defence and migration\u2019.\n\nFor one of the events, the artists are looking for volunteers to spend 12 hours on the beach at Felixstowe, repeatedly raising and lowering the flags of the 205 countries taking part in the Olympics. I can\u2019t wait.\n\nMeanwhile, a performance artist will be towing a portable \u2018island\u2019 around the coast of South-West England, exploring \u2018issues of climate change and land ownership\u2019.\n\nIn Scotland, an artist is busy cutting down trees to create a football field. It will be used to play two matches between teams of immigrants to Britain in order to celebrate diversity \u2014 before the pitch is abandoned so the trees can grow back.\n\nAt least this artist doesn\u2019t appear to be claiming to be exploring \u2018issues of climate change\u2019. But he would certainly do the environment and the public purse a favour by leaving his chainsaw at home.\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad was not dreamed up by the organising committee of London 2012. Any city that holds the Games is required by the Olympic charter to include cultural events.\n\nOlympics of culture: Lord Coe launches the Cultural Olympiad with young stars musician Nitin Swhney, Seb Coe, Jass Singer, Cleveland Watkiss, Actress Scarlett Johnson, Dancer Agnes Oaks, Artist Yinka Shonibare and Jazz Saxophonist Soweto Kinc\n\nPierre de Coubertin, the Frenchman who founded the modern Olympics, insisted the Games should include a programme of arts \u2018to serve to promote harmonious relations, mutual understanding and friendship among the participants and others attending the Olympic Games\u2019.\n\nBetween 1912 and 1952, there were even gold medals awarded for architecture, literature, music, painting and sculpture.\n\nOne of the most unlikely Olympians \u2014 and one which the International Olympic Committee would probably rather forget \u2014 was Adolf Hensel, winner of the gold medal for town-planning in the 1928 Games in Amsterdam. He won the honour for designing the stadium in Nuremburg, which was later used for Hitler\u2019s rallies.\n\nLondon 2012 will take the cultural side of the Games to new levels of daftness.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to be part of the Cultural Olympiad just by painting, singing or dancing; there has to be a fatuous political message thrown in.\n\nThere will be a Shakespeare Festival, but needless to say it is one in which the play Coriolanus has been \u2018re-imagined in the era of 24-hour news, celebrity culture and a new global polity\u2019.\n\nAlso, Romeo And Juliet \u2018finds new purchase in the soil of contemporary Iraq, when sectarian strife between Sunni and Shia, ignited and fuelled from outside, has left a population exhausted by a cycle of violence and revenge\u2019.\n\nMusicians who are part of New Music 20x12 - part of the cultural Olympiad - perform outside the Olympic Stadium\n\nIt\u2019s fine if the Iraqi theatre company which is putting on this show wants to produce a play about modern-day Iraq, but why does it have to try to ride on Shakespeare\u2019s back?\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad is full of the cliches found in so much publicly funded modern art.\n\nThere is a competition in which young people work with professional film-makers \u2014 a perfectly good idea in itself, except that one of the winning entries inevitably features a sullen youth in a hoodie, holding a spray can and moaning about being misunderstood.\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad is a bit like the Millennium Dome: in trying to be everything to everyone it will end up creating nothing of any value.\n\nSurely the biggest cultural legacy of the Olympics ought to be a new arts venue or two for exhibitions and concerts in an area of London without such a facility.\n\nYet so far, the Olympic Legacy Company \u2014 which oversees the future of the Games\u2019 facilities \u2014 has no firm plans to reuse any of the Olympic venues for the arts.\n\nThose that will not be used for sports are due to be demolished, while the main stadium is destined to become yet another football stadium.\n\nStill, this huge arts project probably can\u2019t turn out worse than the Athens Olympics.\n\nThere, the highlight of the Cultural Olympiad was supposed to be an art exhibition called Outlook. It turned out to be little more than attention-seeking filth, with a painting juxtaposing a crucifix and an erect penis, and a photograph of a man apparently copulating with a water melon.\n\nThere is one genuine cultural legacy of the Athens Olympics: the badminton venue was taken over by an American director to become a successful and self-sustaining theatre.\n\nIn keeping with the farce that was the 2004 Olympics, however, the Greek government wants to demolish it.\n\nJudging from the ticket sales, the London Olympics looks set to be a great success. But that\u2019s certainly not thanks to the Cultural Olympiad.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26157344-0-image-a-11_1584611009461.jpg",

Bolivia's 2012 hopefuls\n\n\n\nForeign athletes will benefit from thousands of pounds of British taxpayers' money after a government handout to help train our own team's rivals.\n\nThe Foreign Office has given \u00a315,000 to help Bolivian athletes get ready for the 2012 Olympics in east London, calling the gift part of Britain's 'Olympic legacy'.\n\nThe money will be used to train nearly two dozen Olympic hopefuls at the state-of-the-art High Performance Centre in Sorejapa, on the shores of Lake Titicaca.\n\n'Extremely grateful': The Foreign Office has handed \u00a315,000 to Bolivia to help them train their athletes for the 2012 Olympics in London\n\n'We are extremely grateful,' centre owner Roberto Neilsen Ryes told the Sun. 'The British public's kind generosity will help improve our chances of picking up medals.'\n\nNo Bolivian has ever won an Olympic medal. The cash will fund 23 athletes' training in judo, taekwondo, wrestling, swimming, athletics, cycling, horse riding, rowing and canoeing.\n\nLiberal Democrat Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne donned a poncho to visit the centre, where he said: 'In the UK we hope to win many medals and also share experiences with people of different cultures.'\n\nThe Foreign Office defended the payments, claiming that it supported 'crucial' work towards Britain's Olympic legacy.\n\n'This is part of the crucial work we are doing around the world to help young people become motivated by sport - part of the legacy of London 2012,' it said in a statement.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

without paying \u00a320million", "text": "Taxpayers 0 West Ham 1: Club could still move away from Upton Park without having to stump up \u00a320million\n\nThe news was good for West Ham. It was bad for the taxpayer. And, for all Barry Hearn's tub-thumping rhetoric, it was probably irrelevant to the other interested parties.\n\n\n\nThose were the conclusions at the end of a topsy-turvy day in the endless and embarrassing story of the Olympic Stadium's post-Games fate.\n\n\n\nEight months to the day after the showpiece venue was awarded to West Ham, Minister for Sport Hugh Robertson announced that the whole process would start again.\n\nNearing completion: An aerial view of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford\n\nThis time, the stadium cannot be bought but leased out under public ownership. The reason for going back to the beginning was the fear of what Robertson called 'legal paralysis'.\n\n\n\nTottenham and Hearn's Leyton Orient were objecting to the process though the British courts. The bigger problem was an anonymous complaint filed to the European Commission about the \u00a340million West Ham's partners, Newham Council, were contributing towards the scheme.\n\n\n\nIt was alleged that it amounted to 'state aid' and broke competition rules. The potential for intractable red tape was too much. So, embarrassingly, here we go again.\n\n\n\nThe deadline for new bidders is tentatively set for January. The exact criteria are not yet known but one stipulation is that the running track must be retained.\n\n\n\n'Non-negotiable,' said Robertson, in recognition of the promises Lord Coe made to the IOC about leaving an athletics legacy beyond 2012 and a prerequisite for London's bid to host the 2017 World Championships.\n\n\n\nThe mood at West Ham was bullish, and no wonder when London Mayor Boris Johnson made the prejudicial utterance that 'almost certainly' West Ham would prevail once more.\n\n\n\nKarren Brady, the club's vice chairman, wrote to fans to assure them that the collapse of the original deal was not a mortal blow.\n\nAll smiles: West Ham pose outside the 2012 stadium after their initial victory\n\nVow: Boris Johnson\n\nIn a joint statement with Newham chief executive Kim Bromley-Derry, she said: 'Our bid is the only one that will secure the sporting and community legacy promised - and an amazing yearround home for football, athletics and community events of which the nation can be proud after 2014.'\n\n\n\nThat is the date by which West Ham, or whoever, will move in. Shame we have to go through the same procedure - at public expense, of course - to reach the near-certain conclusion Johnson hinted at.\n\n\n\nThe same conclusion that the Olympic Park Legacy Company reached by a unanimous vote of 14-0 back in February.\n\n\n\nShame, too, that the taxpayer will have to pay more: the old deal saw \u00a395m being spent on turning the stadium from an 80,000-seat arena into a 60,000-seat multipurpose venue.\n\n\n\nThe same reconfiguration is planned this time, but West Ham (who have debts of \u00a380m) will not contribute a \u00a320m share. It remains to be seen if their partners Newham will still hand over their \u00a340m.\n\n\n\nThe \u00a335m already committed in public sector funding stands - though, minus West Ham's old share alone, that will rise to \u00a355m.\n\n\n\nBut Robertson said: 'It is a little bit which way you cut it. The (\u00a320m gap) will be replaced by an annual rental charge by whoever the tenant is.'\n\n\n\nThe rental rate is expected to be around \u00a32m a year, meaning the stadium reconfiguration will not have paid for itself until a decade after the Games.\n\n\n\nEven then the money will go into the Mayor's coffers rather than refund taxpayers. If it is such a good idea, why go through the original tender by different rules?\n\n\n\nFor all that negativity, though, a similar policy was implemented at the City of Manchester Stadium, home of the Commonwealth Games in 2002, where Manchester City pay the council rent for calling it their home.\n\nGrand designs: Spurs also have plans for redeveloping White Hart Lane\n\nMoving out: West Ham are keen to leave Upton Park in east London\n\nTottenham appear near certain not to bid again. They announced in the summer their intention to stay in north London, next to White Hart Lane. The insistence on a track legacy would seal their withdrawal.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, they issued a gloating statement: 'We welcome the OPLC decision to end the current Olympic Stadium bid process. We firmly believe that the bid we put forward was in fact a realistic sporting solution for the stadium, along with a substantial return to the taxpayer, community programming and athletics provision (the r edevelopment of Crystal Palace).'\n\nHearn was more rumbustious. 'It is one of the greatest days of my life,' he crowed.\n\n\n\n'We gambled our future on believing in our case. You can issue as many statements as you like but basically we have won. They have turned round and said, \"Yes, you are right, we don't want to go through a judicial review. We know you are going to win. Your case is unanswerable. We messed up\".\n\n\n\nDelight: Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn will fight on\n\n'The whole process is flawed and little Leyton Orient can hold our heads up because we fought our corner and came out on top. I thought we were going to win on points at the judicial review but we have won by knockout, which is even better.\n\n'We will definitely be making an application. We have to look at the cost of doing that.'\n\n\n\nUK Athletics chairman Ed Warner naturally welcomed the 'bold and decisive move', with an eye on the 2017 bid. But Andrew Boff, the Conservatives' Olympic spokesman in the London Assembly, was less impressed. He blamed a Tory peer.\n\n\n\n'This catastrophe is entirely down to Sebastian Coe's insistence that the stadium should retain an athletics track,' he said. 'Coe's masterplan has turned the Olympic legacy into the Millennium Dome Mk II but with a financial climate that gives it a less positive future.'\n\n\n\nThe blame should be spread more widely. There is plenty to go around.\n\nSorting out the mess - what happens now?\n\nSo, what exactly is happening with the Olympic Stadium?\n\nWest Ham will not be allowed to buy the stadium after London 2012 because\n\nof legal challenges from Tottenham and Leyton Orient.\n\nAnd that means they won't get the stadium?\n\nWell, they can enter the new bidding process and are still favourites to win - even if Minister for Sport Hugh Robertson says there is 'huge interest' in taking up the tenancy.\n\nTottenham, who are potentially their chief rivals, are likely to stay put in north London, but Leyton Orient say they will re-enter the running.\n\nAnd the tenants are still obliged to keep the running track?\n\nYes - it's needed for London's bid to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships and to fulfil Olympic legacy promises.\n\nWhy all this mess?\n\nWhen the plans for the stadium were first drawn up nobody admitted there would be problems covering the cost of running the building after the Games unless a football\n\nclub was involved. A proper solution would have been to install retractable seating to cover the running track when needed - but unfortunately that solution was never seriously considered.\n\n\n\n", "images":

"text": "West Ham's deal to take control of Olympic Stadium collapses after Spurs protest\n\n\n\nBy Sportsmail Reporter\n\nWest Ham's deal to take over the Olympic Stadium has dramatically collapsed.\n\nThe Hammers and Newham Council had agreed a move into the \u00a3486million arena after next summer's Games.\n\nBut the Government, who insist the stadium will not become a 'white elephant', pulled the plug on the deal after legal challenges by Tottenham and Leyton Orient - plus an anonymous complaint to the European Commission - led to fears that court action could drag on for years while the stadium remains empty.\n\nIt will now remain in public ownership after the Olympics and be rented out to the winner of a new bidding process. West Ham have already announced that they will bid to become tenants.\n\nNearing completion: An aerial view of the Olympic Stadium in Stratford\n\nSo, what next?\n\nJanuary 2012: Expected deadline for bidding clubs to submit proposals to become the stadium's tenants February/March: Decision likely on who will become the new tenants July 27 to August 12 - Olympic Games August 29 - September 9 - Paralympic Games September - Work begins on transforming 80,000-seater stadium into 60,000 venue August 2014 - Football club to move into their new stadium for the start of the 2014-15 season\n\nThat would mean a similar deal to the one Manchester City set up with the Commonwealth Games stadium after 2002.\n\nIt is likely that under the new tender process any costs of transforming the stadium after the 2012 Games will be covered by the Olympic Park Legacy Company.\n\nProspective tenants will then be asked to bid for the stadium with the running track remaining in place.\n\nThe tenants would pay an annual rent to the OPLC which could actually prove to be less costly for the likes of West Ham.\n\nThe collapse of the deal for West Ham to buy the stadium has left a funding gap of up to \u00a360m needed to transform the venue before it can be leased out.\n\n\n\nThe deal would have seen the \u00a395m cost split with \u00a335m from the Olympics budget, \u00a320m from West Ham and \u00a340m from Newham Council. If similar changes are to be made then only the \u00a335m is guaranteed and a gap of \u00a360m will have to be filled.\n\nBut London Mayor Boris Johnson insisted the stadium would not become a burden to the taxpayer.\n\nHe said: 'I am confident that this decision is the best way to ensure we have certainty over the stadium's future.\n\n'I believe it will also put us in the place where we always intended to be - delivering a lasting sustainable legacy for the stadium backed up by a robust but flexible business plan that provides a very good return to the taxpayer.'\n\nAll smiles: West Ham pose outside the 2012 stadium after their initial victory\n\nVow: Boris Johnson\n\nSports minister Hugh Robertson added: 'The key point is the action we have taken today is about removing the uncertainty. The process had become bogged down in legal paralysis.\n\n'Particularly relevant has been the anonymous complaint to the EC over \"state aid\" and the OPLC received a letter from Newham Council yesterday saying because of the uncertainty they no longer wanted to proceed.\n\n\n\n'That was the straw that broke the camel's back and we thought it better to stop it dead in it tracks now. We know there is huge interest in the stadium out there from private operators and football clubs and crucially we remove any uncertainty.'\n\n\n\nAround \u00a335m earmarked under the Olympic Budget will be used to transform the stadium after the Games. Prospective tenants will then be asked to bid for the stadium with the running track remaining in place.\n\nRobertson said: 'This is not a white elephant stadium where no-one wants it, we have had two big clubs fighting tooth and nail to get it.\n\n\n\n'The new process will be more like how Manchester City took over the Commonwealth Games stadium which is regarded as a leading example of how to do it.'\n\n\n\nThe move will also remove uncertainty over the stadium ahead of London's bid for the 2017 world athletics championships, although that was not a major consideration in the decision to abandon the current deal.\n\nThe Government, the London Mayor's office and the OPLC have moved to scrap the current deal in order to try to end the legal challenges over the stadium's ownership.\n\nGrand designs: Spurs also have plans for redeveloping White Hart Lane\n\nThere has been an anonymous complaint to the European Commission, claiming that the \u00a340million being provided by Newham to West Ham represented 'state aid'. That complaint was regarded with particular concern with worries that it could take years to come to a conclusion.\n\nThere were also fears that the application for a judicial review by Spurs and Orient could drag on and even if their bids failed they could appeal.\n\nIt is understood that no contract has been signed with West Ham, allowing the move to a fresh tender process, but the club will be encouraged to bid again.\n\nIn February, West Ham were selected as the preferred bidder for the stadium. The club planned to downsize from 80,000 to 60,000 seats on a 125-year lease.\n\nA joint statement from West Ham and Newham before the official Government statement read: 'We understand Ministers will make a statement later and will not pre-empt that.\n\nMoving out: West Ham are keen to leave Upton Park in east London\n\n'Uncertainty caused by the anonymous complaint to the European Commission and ongoing legal challenges have put the Olympic legacy at risk and certainly a stadium, as we envisioned it, may not be in place by 2014 due as a direct result of the legal delay.\n\n'Therefore we would welcome a move by OPLC and government to end that uncertainty and allow a football and athletics stadium to be in place by 2014 under a new process. If the speculation is true, West Ham will look to become a tenant of the stadium while Newham will aim to help deliver the legacy.\n\n\n\n'Our bid is the only one that will secure the sporting and community legacy promise of the Olympic Stadium - an amazing year-round home for football, athletics and community events of which the nation could be proud.\n\n\n\n'The true legacy of London 2012 will be the creation of jobs and a generation of young people inspired by sport based around a community home for all by 2014. We remain committed to help deliver that legacy promise to the people of London and the nation.'\n\nWest Ham had planned to retain the running track after leaving their current home at Upton Park, while Tottenham proposed knocking down most of the stadium and building a 60,000-seater, football-only venue on the same site without any athletics legacy.\n\nHigh hopes: West Ham want to be playing top-flight football at Stratford\n\nLeyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn welcomed the news and confirmed his club would look to be a tenant when the new tender process opens.\n\n\n\n'Today is a fabulous day for Leyton Orient fans,' he told Sky Sports News. 'It puts the whole thing back in the public domain as it should be.\n\n\n\n'The system of deliverance was fundamentally flawed and now they have got to go back to the beginning and start again and we will be an interested party in that bidding process.\n\n\n\n'West Ham are not a shoo-in, that's very good because they will be competing with a host of other people who have claims on and plans for the Olympic Stadium. It's a legacy operation and at last the OPLC have finally listened to someone with common sense and said 'we messed it up before, let's not mess it up again'. The whole process starts now.\n\n\n\n'I can tell you that I am definitely interested in being part of the tender process. If that involves groundshare, we will have to look at the situation and see if it makes sense for everyone.\n\n\n\n'But we are a small club and we would be lost in a 60,000-seater. Perhaps it makes more sense to go back to the original plan for 25,000 seats which is fine for athletics - perhaps it makes more sense to spend less money on conversion costs and actually get a proper, community-spirited club in there which fits the ethos of what we're talking about, the Olympic Games.\n\n\n\nDelight: Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn will fight on\n\n'The expert advice that we got on European law and on state aid showed that the Newham loan was illegal, which we said from day one. No one listened to us at all, they just thought we were little Leyton Orient, just go away and return to the wilderness of the east end of London.'\n\n\n\nUK Athletics chairman Ed Warner welcomed the move, telling BBC Radio Five Live : 'It's fantastic for UK Athletics and it is a bold and decisive move by the legacy company.'\n\nWarner also predicted that the decision would help London's bid for the 2017 World Athletics Championships.\n\n\n\nHe added: 'We had a meeting with the IAAF inspectors last week and we gave Government guarantees that the athletics track will stay in place.\n\n\n\nThe move you see today is simply confirmation of what we told the IAAF. The IAAF were concerned when they arrived but when they left they told us that the issue was completely resolved. We laid out the legal options and they went away happy. I'm very hopeful that we will get the nod for 2017.'\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

stadium collapses", "text": "Taxpayers face new Olympic bill for millions after West Ham's stadium deal falls through\n\n\n\n\u00a350m public cost to convert stadium and \u00a35m a year to maintain\n\nBut West Ham will try to pay just \u00a32m a year in knock-down rent deal\n\nSpurs complain that \u00a340m council fund towards site was illegal 'state aid'\n\n\n\nTaxpayers face a bill running into tens of millions of pounds after a proposed deal to sell the Olympic stadium to West Ham United collapsed yesterday.\n\nThe cost of converting the flagship arena to accommodate a smaller number of spectators (\u00a350 million) and maintaining it (\u00a35 million a year) will now fall back on the public purse.\n\nMeanwhile cash-strapped West Ham, relegated from the Premier League last year, emerged as the big winners from the fiasco - as they could pay as little as \u00a32million a year to rent the stadium when it eventually reopens after next year\u2019 s Games.\n\nLondon 2012 chairman Sebastian Coe (left) and Olympian Frank Fredericks mark the completion of construction on the Olympic Stadium as they lay the last piece of turf in March. It will today be announced that the deal to award West Ham the arena after the London 2012 games has fallen apart\n\nNew deal: The stadium will remain in public ownership and leased out to an anchor tenant following a new tender process. West Ham have already announced they are bidding to become the tenant\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson has moved to scrap the current deal in order to try to end the legal challenges over the stadium's ownership\n\nThe deal for the East End football club to buy the 80,000-seater stadium \u2013 which cost half a billion pounds to build - in partnership with Newham Council broke down with no end in sight to a legal battle triggered by rival bidder Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nSpurs had argued that a \u00a340 million fund from Newham council towards the cost of converting the Olympic Stadium to a smaller 60,000-seater arena was an unfair advantage during the bid as it amounted to illegal 'state aid'.\n\nFears are mounting that the stadium could remain empty for years and become a \u2018white elephant\u2019.\n\nLegal challenges by Spurs and Leyton Orient, and an anonymous complaint to the European Commission had heightened concerns about an indefinite delay to negotiations.\n\nThe stadium will now remain in public ownership and the OPLC will try to find tenants willing to pay rental on the venue.\n\nSome \u00a335 million already earmarked under the Olympic Budget will be used to transform the stadium after the Games.\n\nProspective tenants will be asked to bid for the stadium, with the running track remaining in place.\n\nFormer London mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: \u201cWith just eight months to the Olympic Games it\u2019s essential this fiasco is sorted out quickly.\n\n'The drift and delay we have seen over the past two years cannot continue. It\u2019s time for the Mayor of London to get a grip and put the interests of Londoners first.\n\n'It\u2019s time for the Mayor to take responsibility and ensure the future of the stadium delivers the greatest possible value for London taxpayers and a world-class sporting legacy that will benefit ordinary Londoners.'\n\nAndrew Boff, Olympic spokesman for the Conservative Group on the London Assembly, said: \u201cThis catastrophe is entirely down to Sebastian Coe\u2019s insistence that the stadium should retain an athletics track after the Olympics.\n\nAll smiles: West Ham's board of directors, including The Apprentice TV star and businesswoman Karren Brady, pose outside the Olympic Stadium after their initial victory earlier this year\n\nOLYMPIC STADIUM - TIMELINE OF FOOTBALL CLUBS EYEING BIG MOVE\n\nNovember 2007 - Stadium design officially unveiled. Leyton Orient football club begins preliminary talks about moving into the stadium . January 2010 - West Ham confirms it wants to move into the Olympic Stadium. March 2010 - The race to use the Olympic Stadium after the London 2012 Games begins as prospective tenants are asked to make their interest known . October 2010 - Tottenham Hotspur reveals it is making a joint bid with sport and entertainment giant AEG to move into the stadium. November 2010 - West Ham and Tottenham are short-listed as the two final bidders. February 2011 - The OPLC announces West Ham as its preferred bidder. October 2011 - Legal wrangles cause OPLC and the Government to decide to keep the stadium under public ownership. West Ham announces its intention to be the tenants.\n\n'That criterion reduced the number of bidders for the site and prevented any serious sustainable regeneration plans, with the exception of that by Spurs, coming forward.\n\n'Coe\u2019s masterplan has turned the Olympic legacy into the Millennium Dome mark two but with a financial climate that gives it a less positive future.\u2019\n\nMayor of London Boris Johnson claimed yesterday\u2019s decision is \u2018the best way to ensure we have certainty over the stadium\u2019s future\u2019.\n\nHe added: 'We will keep it in public hands but we will effectively rent it to a football club, almost certainly West Ham, and that will cover the costs and I think it will be a very good deal for the taxpayer.'\n\nSports minister Hugh Robertson said the West Ham deal had become \u2018bogged down in legal paralysis\u2019.\n\n'Particularly relevant has been the anonymous complaint to the EC over \u2018state aid\u2019 and the OPLC received a letter from Newham Council saying because of the uncertainty they no longer wanted to proceed. That was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back and we thought it better to stop it dead in its tracks now.\u2019\n\nIt is understood that no contract has been signed with West Ham, allowing the move to a fresh tender process, but the club will be encouraged to bid again.\n\nInterested parties will have until January to submit their bids and the OPLC will then try and put together a package of tenants that makes the stadium viable.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

Stadium 'white elephant' tag", "text": "Coe sticks to his guns over Olympic Stadium and dismisses 'white elephant' tag\n\nSebastian Coe has rejected claims that the Olympic Stadium was in danger of becoming a white elephant.\n\n\n\nA deal with West Ham and Newham Council collapsed amid legal challenges, with the Government announcing last week that the stadium would remain in public ownership and be leased out after the 2012 Games.\n\n\n\nThe London 2012 chairman said: 'I think it was the right decision to cut through the potential for ongoing legal challenge here and, worse than that, ongoing legal challenge that was taxpayer-fuelled.\n\n\n\nWhite Elephant: The battle continues over what shall be done with the Olympic Stadium after the Games\n\n'I do think it is very important that we maintain a commitment to an Olympic legacy and to a mix of tenancies in there - that is a commitment we made and think we should see through.'\n\n\n\nLondon 2012 and Olympic Delivery Authority Executives were appearing at City Hall to answer questions about preparations for the Games.\n\n\n\nAssembly member John Biggs said: 'The decision that has been made regarding the stadium is at very high risk of creating a white elephant.'\n\n\n\nHe also suggested that the unravelling of the stadium deal and the 'continued insistence on the mixture of uses in the legacy is at risk of jeopardising at massive public expenditure' the future of the venue.\n\n\n\nA 'more fundamental review' of the options might be considered, he noted.\n\n\n\nLord Coe, a two-time athletics 1500m Olympic champion, also knocked back suggestions that there was not enough demand for athletics at the stadium.\n\n\n\nStanding firm: Sebastian Coe continues to fight against critics of the Games\n\nCapacity at the 80,000-seat stadium is set to be shrunk after the Games. Original proposals were that it be a 25,000-seat venue with an athletics track. A football club as a tenant is still possible.\n\n\n\nAsked how many people he would expect to attend an athletics event, Lord Coe noted that London was bidding to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships in the belief that there would be full crowds throughout the competition.\n\n\n\nClassic one-day international track meetings, such as the Diamond League, showed there was a demand for athletics in Britain, he argued.\n\n\n\nLord Coe said: 'London is now the only city that stages two of those back-to-back. We not only sell out for every one of those meetings but we would also probably be able to sell five times that number of tickets.\n\n\n\nPut to use: West Ham were in line to purchase the stadium, but the deal collapsed\n\n'There is no lack of demand for top-class track and field in this country but clearly sitting alongside the use of the stadium for local events, English schools championships and the plethora of events and other competitions that are there.'\n\n\n\nIt also has to be for community-based used which 'for one of our national sports is not an unreasonable thing to ask for in London,' he said.\n\n\n\nA one-day meeting in Brussels or Paris could draw crowds of between 50,000-70,000 people.\n\n\n\nLord Coe added: 'If we had a larger venue we would fill that venue. You have only got to go to Crystal Palace for any of those Diamond League meetings to know how many people turn up on spec hoping to get tickets. Don't run away with the idea that track and field is a sport that is not supported.'\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

first, or sport becomes a killer", "text": "Safety first, or sport becomes a killer... as proved with Dan Wheldon\n\n\n\nOne of the founding principles of western medicine originates from the Latin phrase primum non nocere, which translates as first do no harm. This simple instruction supersedes cures and healing, prognoses and diagnoses; it certainly takes precedent over the budgetary requirements of NHS middle managers.\n\n\n\nPrimum non nocere cuts directly to the heart of modern medical care. Do not make a bad situation worse, it says. The patient is in enough trouble as it is without you sawing off the wrong leg, or any leg at all unless absolutely convinced this will improve his prospects.\n\nIt would serve equally well as rule No 1 for any sporting body, too. Had the executives of IndyCar had an equivalent of 'first do no harm' in their charter, Dan Wheldon would be alive today.\n\nTragedy: Dan Wheldon lost his life in an horrific crash at the Las Vegas Indy300 this week\n\nThis is what happens when sport loses sight of its duty of care. IndyCar forgot that its first responsibility is not to the owners, the sponsors, the television companies, the promoters; it is not even to the fans.\n\n\n\nIndyCar's primary mission is to ensure - as much as is possible in a sport with inherent danger - that its drivers compete and finish safely. Everything else lines up behind.\n\nWheldon was racing at 225mph around a 1.5mile oval track, amid 34 cars, often four abreast. The only shock, really, is an absence of fatalities on other weekends.\n\n\n\nHe had also been offered an incentive of \u00a33.16m if he could win the race from last place on the grid. Who knows if this compromised his thought processes when carnage unfolded ahead? A serious crash was also an opportunity to make up ground through the field. In a split second, did one instinct overrule another? We can never know.\n\nIt seems a long way from a Las Vegas speedway track to Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand, but that is where the journey takes us, if we let it. Almost five days on and still the fall-out from the red card shown to Wales captain Sam Warburton in a Rugby World Cup semi-final continues.\n\n\n\nHorrific: British driver Wheldon was killed in a 15-car pile-up on a track where speeds reached 225mph\n\nThere will be further recriminations on Sunday, if France put up a poor show against New Zealand in the final. Welsh absence will be regretted and referee Alain Rolland's adherence to the rulebook cursed.\n\n\n\nYet what happens if rugby stops caring for its protagonists? It ends up as IndyCar, with blood on its hands. Warburton was sent off because the consequences of a tip tackle are horribly grim; and the moment rugby no longer recognises this it invites tragedy in through the front door.\n\n\n\nIn this of all weeks, the International Rugby Board should be commended for understanding that player safety outrides any talk of the occasion, or some unquantifiable feeling for the game that referees must possess.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, IndyCar got its spectacle in Las Vegas on Sunday; but at the cost of a man's life.\n\n\n\nHere is a bit of fun for the morning tea-break. Take your favourite piece of newspaper polemic in support of greater leniency for tip tackling and replace the key words in the headline with the consequence of dropping an opponent head first from height.\n\nA duty of care: Dangerous sports' governing bodies must protect their sportsmen from harm\n\nI'll start you off with an example. Here is a headline from a column in The Independent by Jonathan Davies, the former Wales fly-half: 'Forget directives, it's a dose of common sense we need now.' So take out the key words and insert the potential consequences of tip tackling, and what have you got? 'Forget directives, it's a broken neck we need now.' You try one.\n\n\n\nWhat is amusing is how quickly rugby is catching up with football, having occupied the high moral ground for so long. It turns out that the sport is not above slagging off the referee for making a significant judgment call in an important match, nor is it above specious claims of victimhood, the type that pollute every Saturday evening phone-in these days.\n\n\n\n'I've just come back from Rotherham United and the referee was rubbish...' Yes, mate, he always is at Rotherham. That's been the problem there for 141 years: lousy referees.\n\nIt wouldn't have happened to an All Black, we hear. Tana Umaga got away with doing it to Brian O'Driscoll in 2005. Worse has gone unpunished in other games. Fabrice Estrabanez of France and Sukanaivalu Hufanga of Tonga only got yellow cards for tip tackles. And on and on.\n\nRed card: Wales captain Sam Warburton was sent off for a tip tackle on Vincent Clerc last weekend\n\nIt cannot be long before somebody claims all they want is for referees to be consistent, and arranges a meeting with the head official, Paddy O'Brien. Hi-ho the derry-o, football here we come.\n\n\n\nToo right, Umaga was lightly treated during the Lions tour in 2005 and that is one of the reasons IRB directives around dangerous tackles changed. So, yes, it would happen to a New Zealand player these days because the rulebook insists on it. Others, such as Hufanga, have earned lengthy suspensions for tip tackling at this Rugby World Cup, despite not being sent off at the time.\n\n\n\nYet the fact that some referees judging similar offences have chosen to issue yellow cards and 10 minutes in the sin bin, rather than red, signalling permanent expulsion from the game, is because referees are human beings, not robot overlords, and therefore capable of variance.\n\n\n\nRolland cannot be responsible for the relative leniency of Steve Walsh when in charge of the match between France and Tonga. He can only be true to what he thinks is right. Equally, the IRB cannot factor in the possibility that the best northern hemisphere team will not get to the final when they issue guidelines on tip tackling. They can only consider the cost in human, not sporting, terms, and act accordingly.\n\n\n\nThis admirable concern has not happened within the offices of IndyCar. If anything, the well-being of the drivers has been relegated to the third tier, behind commercial considerations and delivering excitement for the fans.\n\nInitially, the \u00a33.16m bonus prize for 2005 champion Wheldon was going to be offered to a driver from outside the IndyCar community. And these cars race in packs at 225mph, remember. The outcome, horrendous as it already is, might even have been worse had the field been peppered with IndyCar virgins.\n\n\n\nWe are dealing with extreme sports here, IndyCar and rugby. Driving fast around a track has always been considered the work of the most daring members of the community, however, and all involved know the dangers of human error.\n\n\n\nYet rugby's extremes have evolved. As the sport has embraced professionalism, fitness levels have increased. The players are bigger, the hits are bigger, the pain is greater, the potential damage more severe. Even the full backs have upper arms like ham hocks these days, scrum-halves are six-footers.\n\n\n\n'It is not a contact sport, it is a collision sport,' said Francois Pienaar, South Africa's World Cup-winning captain from 1995. Rugby was always hard, and there was risk, but these days the players are honed enough to make tackle after relentless tackle, to put their bodies on the line more readily. The hits in historical matches seem almost demure by comparison.\n\nIt is in this environment that the IRB seek to avert disaster, and if they make this the priority, that is proper governance.\n\n\n\nPrimum non nocere. There can be no guarantees, but those who ignore the principle in sport do so at their peril; or at the peril of brave men like the late Dan Wheldon.\n\nLet's keep Olympics on the level\n\nWilliam Fox-Pitt (right), the leading three-day eventer in the world, is angry that foreign competitors are being allowed to use British facilities in the build-up to the Olympic Games.\n\n\n\n'There is an element to being British that says, \"Let's all share\",' he complains. 'I don't think it's about sharing. It's a competitive world and it's about making use of our own facilities and systems.'\n\n\n\nNo, it isn't. It is about welcoming the world to London for a festival of sport.\n\n\n\nWe are not Canada. We should not wish to own the podium, by fair means or foul. The Plastic Brit phenomenon already shows a disappointing aversion to the principles of fair play if medals are at stake. Yes, we would like the home athlete to be victorious; but not at all costs.\n\nIf British equestrianism gives every rider a fair shake, it should be applauded, not considered queer.\n\nBit late now Arsene, eh?\n\nIt is now being claimed that Arsene Wenger has \u00a350million to spend on improving his squad this season.\n\n\n\nIsn't it funny how, once the transfer window is shut, Arsenal have all this money just lying around, yet when it was open, it was almost as if they had to sell their two best players to get a decent centre half?\n\nDirty Laundry\n\nRicardo Teixeira, president of Brazil's 2014 World Cup organising committee, is now the subject of an official police investigation into illegal transfer of funds and money laundering.\n\n\n\nWeasels on the run. No let-up. We will get there in the end.\n\nNo winners in race row\n\nThe problem with claims of racism is that they are often impossible to prove. Unless the offending phrase has been heard, it is the word of one man against another. So it is with Patrice Evra and Luis Suarez. Evra is adamant he was insulted; Suarez equally furious in his denial.\n\nTelevision evidence reveals nothing, the referee heard only Evra's complaint and the clubs are backing their men but, then, they would.\n\n\n\nJ'accuse: Patrice Evra (left) says Luis Suarez (centre) made racist remarks to him last weekend\n\nEvra was previously involved in a confrontation with Chelsea groundsman Sam Bethell, amid claims that he was provoked by being called an 'immigrant'. The FA found no evidence of racism on Bethell's part and Evra was banned for four matches for fighting.\n\nYet, equally, David Rocastle once revealed, after Arsenal had played Independiente of Argentina, that the opposition players knew only one word of English and it was n****r. So it would not be the first time an opponent has tried to wind up a black player this way.\n\nUnfortunately, the unsightly spectacle of claim and counter-claim demeans both sides. We do not know who to believe, so we end up doubting all parties. Without proof, this is truly a game without winners.\n\nWhat do Orient bring to table?\n\nBarry Hearn, chairman of Leyton Orient, says Tottenham Hotspur took what he calls a bung to withdraw from the battle for the Olympic Stadium. Boris Johnson, the London Mayor, has offered \u00a317million to help with new transport facilities around a redeveloped White Hart Lane.\n\n\n\n'I would take a bung if it helped us,' Hearn mused.\n\n\n\nHe was using a figure of speech, but was not far from the truth.\n\n\n\nOrient's claim on the Olympic site seems built around a rather spurious sense of entitlement. It is hard to see what they are bringing to the party.\n\n\n\nWest Ham United want to keep the running track - thereby maintaining the Olympic legacy - and much of the capacity, so that the arena can stage major events in other sports, including cricket and rugby, plus concerts.\n\n\n\nOlympic dream: Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn wants his club to move to the stadium in Stratford\n\nTottenham, by staying where they are, will help drive the much-needed regeneration of their area.\n\n\n\nLeyton Orient? It is not so much what Hearn can do for you, as what you can do for Hearn. Like as good as knock the stadium down, leaving it with a 25,000 capacity and no running track.\n\n\n\n'Can we build up, if not down, and get it covered when we play?' Hearn asks. 'We wouldn't move in with a running track between the pitch and crowd.'\n\nWell, don't do us any favours, Barry. We'd hate to inconvenience a football club that currently averages 3,710 fans per league game with something as trifling as an Olympic legacy.\n\n\n\nWhat do Leyton Orient want with a 25,000 capacity stadium anyway? They cannot fill the 9,271 spaces at Brisbane Road. As for building down, the Olympic stadium was constructed on contaminated land. They've gone as far as is safe. Build down and Hearn might be able to get his fans closer to the action, but they might not be able to see it for green smoke and quadruple-headed mutant sewer rats.\n\n\n\nMaybe Hearn thinks he can pad out the arena with discount offers and reduced ticket prices, except it is precisely that type of pledge that has made him such an opponent of the West Ham bid.\n\nArtists' impression: How West Ham see the Olympic Stadium looking in future - but what do Orient propose?\n\nHearn talks community, but what could be more of a community initiative than a club based in the London borough of Newham, moving to a stadium in the London borough of Newham, and offering cheaper tickets to the people of the London borough of Newham?\n\nIt was little more than two years ago that Hearn was so taken with Leyton Orient's role in the community that he was talking of transferring to Harlow or Basildon 'where a lot of our core support has moved'.\n\n\n\nEarlier that year, Hearn's company, Matchroom, bought Brisbane Road with an arrangement that splits the profits 50-50 with the club in the event of a sale.\n\n\n\nSo, just to recap: we spend \u00a3496m building a pristine Olympic facility, we then reduce it to slightly less than the size of the Darlington Arena, abandon or submerge the running track at enormous cost and move in the 21st-best team in League One, leaving the chairman free to cut a property deal on his former home around the corner.\n\n\n\nHearn is due in court, asking for his legal costs in mounting the challenges that forced a judicial review. The figure is in the region of \u00a3250,000 and, if he is successful, will be met by the Olympic Park Legacy Company and perhaps Newham council.\n\nStill no news on what Leyton Orient are bringing to the table, though, beside a big empty sack for that Government bung.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/10/18/article-2050639-0E67EEE200000578-756_634x369.jpg",

Olympic Park", "text": "Welcome to Ikeaville: Flatpack furniture giant to build 26-acre suburb at London's Olympic Park (let's just hope they don't lose the manual)\n\nIkea has announced that it is moving into the property business as it reveals a new 26-acre development near the Olympic Park.\n\n\n\nStrand East will contain 1,200 new homes, 480,000 square feet of offices and a 350-bedroom hotel in Stratford, east London.\n\n\n\nIt is the first major British development for LandProp, part of the Inter Ikea Group, which owns the intellectual assets of the furniture chain.\n\n\n\nPlans: Strand East will stand in the shadow of the Olympic stadium in east London\n\nThe company is believed to have paid about \u00a325million for the site, which had previously been in receivership.\n\nIt is the second biggest private-sector project in the Olympic Park, after the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre which opened last month.\n\n'Not only does it create a new high quality, waterside destination which provides new homes, jobs and leisure facilities, it is a demonstration of investor confidence in the area's future in a difficult market,' Olympic Legacy Minister Bob Neill said.\n\nThe development's canalside location has led to it being called a 'mini Venice', and it will boast a boat taxi service and a floating cocktail bar.\n\n\n\nPoliticians hope the Games will spark a wider regeneration of the area.\n\n\n\nIkea: The developer is a company linked to the chain of furniture stores\n\nLandProp managing director Harald Muller said: 'We are hugely excited to be bringing forward these plans, we see Strand East as a place for families which contributes to the regeneration of Stratford and takes its place alongside the many neighbourhoods of London.'\n\n\n\nHe added that although London would be the focus of its UK activities as 'the machine that will always work', the company was already assembling sites in undisclosed locations around the UK.\n\n\n\nThe development company already operates in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Holland among other countries.\n\n", "images":

Warner", "text": "Warner confident London can trump Doha as World Championships vote looms\n\nUK Athletics chief Ed Warner has promised world records and big crowds if London wins the right to host the 2017 World Championships.\n\nUKA's bid to bring the biennial showpiece to the 2012 Olympic Stadium will be put to a vote of 27 International Association of Athletics Federations council members in Monaco on Friday.\n\nLondon is up against a rival bid from Qatari capital Doha but Warner, the chairman of UKA, is convinced London has a strong case.\n\nKey: The Olympic Stadium is central to London's bid\n\nWarner told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme: 'This is an athlete-centric bid.\n\n'We are putting in place conditions which will be ideal for athletes to break records in London.\n\n'With the right time of the year in the athletics calendar, we have a great facility at the Olympic Stadium and it is going to be full - morning and evening sessions - of fans that understand athletics and are passionate about it.\n\n'And they'll be from nations all around the world. London is a multi-cultural diverse city. Every athlete will have a home set of supporters there.'\n\nFull of hope: Ed Warner\n\nWarner is also convinced that a London championships would be a huge commerical success and he also believes the desire for a strong Olympic legacy post-2012 will stand the bid in good stead.\n\nHe added: 'Secondly, we have got a very strong commercial bid. If we win we will be bringing the World Championships back to western Europe - the bread basket of the sport.\n\n'It's absolutely critical for the health of global athletics we nurture the audience in the core western European market.\n\n'Finally, the Olympic legacy itself. We have had huge support from the IAAF to secure the future of the Olympic Stadium for athletics for many years to come.\n\n'This would complete the circle - to bring athletics back to the stadium to justify its existence for the long term.'\n\nWarner admits the Doha bid does have its positives but is concentrating only on arguing the case for London and winning over a 'large wedge of swing votes'.\n\nHe said: 'The Doha bid will be technically excellent and they have a very powerful argument of taking the sport into virgin territories.\n\n'However, when I look at the commercial appeal of London, it stands head and shoulders above any other city.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

teeter on the edge of a slump", "text": "What's another billion or three!\n\nPleading guilty to being a party pooper, ROBERT HARDMAN says that as we teeter on the edge of a slump, the ever-soaring cost of the Olympics is unforgiveable\n\n\n\nEvery day, the organisers of the 2012 Olympics must thank their lucky stars for unending global economic disaster. \u2018Pheweee,\u2019 they mutter as another basket-case economy in the Eurozone demands another trillion on pain of implosion.\n\n\n\nBecause if times were normal and stable, there would not just be an outcry about the handling of the London Games. Heads would roll.\n\nMinisters would be apologising to the House every week.\n\nInstead, we just shrug. Another billion or three chucked down the pan by another bunch of unsackable incompetents? Never mind. It\u2019s only a few billion. That\u2019ll barely cover their pensions anyway.\n\nThe London 2012 Olympics running track: The cost of the opening ceremonies is just one of those that has dramatically increased from the original estimate\n\nHence, our virtual indifference to this week\u2019s announcement that Olympic organisers have miscalculated the number of security guards required \u2014 by, er, more than 100 per cent.\n\n\n\nLast week, the Games were going to need 10,000 guards. This week, the figure has been revised to 23,000. Once again, never mind. Let\u2019s throw money at the problem. We are going to spend an extra \u00a3271 million to resolve the matter. That\u2019s \u00a321,000 per extra guard. Not bad for a fortnight\u2019s work. That\u2019s more than some soldiers in Helmand get in a year.\n\n\n\nWho is to blame for getting this so amazingly wrong? Yesterday, I asked the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (the bit of the Government in charge of the Olympics), the London organising committee LOCOG and the Home Office.\n\n\n\nEach one steered me to one of the other two.\n\n\n\nThe Home Office offered the following general explanation: \u2018The plans for venue security have matured considerably as venues have been completed.\u2019 It\u2019s not terribly reassuring, is it?\n\n\n\nBarmy\n\n\n\nArial photo shot of the London 2012 Olympic Stadium to mark '1 year to go to the Olympic Games'. Expected costs of the games have risen yet again this year\n\nMeanwhile, in other news, the opening and closing ceremonies will no longer be a \u00a340 million festival of British exuberance. The cost has doubled. Only the other day, one of the organisers assured me that the extravaganzas would be so spectacular that they would make me \u2018weep\u2019.\n\n\n\nClearly, it has already made other people weep. Because we now learn that the Prime Minister has authorised a further \u00a340 million from the Olympic contingency pot to be spent on the big show.\n\n\n\nWhy the doubling of the budget overnight? What on earth was wrong with the original plan?\n\n\n\nOlympics Minister Hugh Robertson assures us that it will be money well spent in terms of promoting Britain.\n\n\n\nPerhaps this former Army officer can, at least, insist that the organisers include the most famous image of London in their show in return?\n\n\n\nFor as things stand, not a single member of the best display team in the land \u2014 the Foot Guards \u2014 has been invited to take part. If we have to cough up another \u00a340 million, can we please see a few bearskins and the Band of the Household Division in addition to all The X Factor winners and East End diversity acts.\n\n\n\nJust about everything we were promised in the barmy, cocksure campaign to secure this municipal ego trip has failed to materialise.\n\n\n\nThe bills are soaring. The fluffy bunny stuff about \u2018inspiring\u2019 a new generation of athletes has been proved to be palpable nonsense. As for the promise of a tourism bonanza, it\u2019s looking so grim that West End theatres may have to shut up shop for the duration.\n\n\n\nEvery day, we get news of a fresh \u2018adjustment\u2019 or a tweak to a particular budget.\n\nIf we are going to have to spend an extra \u00a340 million, can we at least have some Household Cavalry thrown into the proceedings?\n\nMy personal favourite is the swimming pool, originally planned for a whopping \u00a373 million and now well on its way to the \u00a3300 million mark.\n\nThe roof alone has cost more than \u00a3100 million.\n\n\n\nJust this week, we learned that the pool needs yet another top-up. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s just another \u00a35 million. Why?\n\n\n\nApparently, it is because of \u2018the greater clarity now established on the final costs of commissioning the venue\u2019. In other words, we got our sums wrong \u2014 again. It\u2019s been the story of the Games.\n\n\n\nAnd still, the organisers or the Olympics Minister assure us that they are \u2018on budget\u2019 \u2014 much as Greece likes to assure us that it is not bust.\n\n\n\nBut, this week, some inescapable truth broke through the cloud of obfuscation. Those pesky accountants at the National Audit Office (NAO) are just refusing to get with the Olympic spirit.\n\n\n\nInstead, in their latest Olympic Progress report, they warn that \u2018more money will be needed unless there is rigorous action to control costs\u2019.\n\n\n\nDeluded\n\n\n\nKen Livingstone admitted the London bid had been a 'con trick' to siphon off government money into the East End\n\nAs things stand, with eight months to go, the contingency fund for all unexpected eventualities \u2014 floods, strikes, terrorism, bird flu \u2014 stands at \u00a336 million. I suppose it might cover the unpaid minibar bills once the International Olympic Committee has moved on.\n\n\n\nBut does anyone think that will be enough?\n\n\n\nIf they can get the security guards wrong to the tune of \u00a3271 million this week, what do you think they might come up with next week?\n\n\n\nThe list of false promises goes right back to 2005 when the then London Mayor Ken Livingstone, Sebastian Coe and former Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell promised us the Games would cost an eye-watering \u00a32.4 billion.\n\n\n\nThen it doubled. Then it trebled. By 2007, it had hit \u00a39.3 billion. That\u2019s still the figure, so we are told by the organisers.\n\n\n\nBut listen to the ex-organisers.\n\nFirst, there was the extraordinary admission from Jack Lemley, the former chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority (the bit that builds the stadiums). He resigned in 2006, conceding that the final bill could hit \u00a320 billion.\n\n\n\nTwo years later, Ken Livingstone admitted the London bid had been a \u2018con trick\u2019 to siphon off government money into the East End.\n\n\n\nThen there were the deluded promises that a victorious Olympic bid would somehow translate into a million new people playing some sort of sport. This week\u2019s NAO report gives the true figure \u2014 108,600.\n\n\n\nWe have had no such trouble boosting our obesity rates, however. But what did we expect? Was the bid team being incredibly naive or just deceitful?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the European Tour Operators Association has reported that bookings for London during the Olympics have fallen off a cliff. They are 90 per cent down. At least London\u2019s rivals are happy, proving there is no place for sentimentality in the cut-throat world of flogging bed space.\n\nVisitScotland, for example, have just declared the London reservation slump as a \u2018fantastic opportunity\u2019, adding: \u2018We will be looking to tactically target those who are looking to get away.\u2019 And who can blame them?\n\nThe Orbit tower under construction at the Olympic stadium - but it is the cost of the games that have gone into orbit\n\nNow, I know we should all be \u2018getting right behind the Games\u2019 and being a little more patriotic. But as someone who has been grumbling about the megalomania of the Olympic movement since long before London was awarded these Games, I happily plead guilty to being a party pooper.\n\n\n\nBut we might, at least, have been told the truth.\n\n\n\nInstead, we have been treated like imbeciles by those who believe they have a divine right to squander other people\u2019s money in the name of sport. It is also our misfortune that we should have signed up to this in times of plenty and are still obliged to deliver the same star-spangled show during a vicious recession that is teetering on becoming a slump.\n\nBut then normal rules do not apply when it comes to the Olympics.\n\nJust two years ago, LOCOG, was offered a bargain \u2014 a 10,000-seat stadium just five minutes walk from the Olympic Park. Leyton Orient Football Club would not be using their ground during Olympic fortnight. Club chairman Barry Hearn was offering it to Lord Coe\u2019s lot for absolutely nothing.\n\n\n\nIt might save, say, the cost of building a \u00a320 million hockey stadium.\n\n\n\nThe response? No thanks. As far as LOCOG was concerned, it had promised London and the International Olympic Committee a brand new shiny hockey stadium. And that was what it was going to deliver.\n\nLegacy\n\n\n\nIt was all part of the great Olympic \u2018legacy\u2019 \u2014 regardless of the demand for hockey stadiums in Newham, East London.\n\n\n\nIt is far too late to change much about these Games, let alone give them back to Beijing.\n\n\n\nSo let us make them work. But that does not mean we have to carry on treating them as a special case, shovelling good money after bad.\n\n", "images":

Martin Samuel", "text": "Crisis... what crisis? Manchester United will make sure UEFA see them right\n\nThe Stretford End can sleep easy. Long term, there really is no crisis at Manchester United: UEFA will see to that. Right now, however easily Wolverhampton Wanderers were rolled over on Saturday, issues remain.\n\n\n\nThe midfield needs an upgrade, the young players will take time to develop and replacing all-time greats such as Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs is near impossible.\n\nThe growing power of Manchester City may even test the resolve of Sir Alex Ferguson. Stay strong, however, and all will return to its natural order.\n\n\n\nFalse alarm: Wayne Rooney is dejected in Basle, but the club will still thrive\n\nWhy do you think David Gill, Manchester United's chief executive, is so staunchly behind the new financial fair play regulations? He knows that, once established, they will give United the clout to overcome setbacks far greater than defeat in Basle.\n\n\n\nTheir spending power will be so huge, their advantages so many, that an early Champions League exit will be as unlikely as a lap of honour from Malcolm Glazer.\n\n\n\nEven before Wednesday's defeat, Gill was insisting that UEFA impose 'appropriate sanctions' on clubs who fail to comply with financial fair play. This lobbying will redouble with United vulnerable.\n\n\n\nSo forget talk of the empire falling. United may have rough times immediately ahead, but long-term can emerge stronger than ever.\n\n\n\nAny despondency around Old Trafford is as misplaced as the optimism that has met Martin O'Neill's arrival at Sunderland. Not because he is the wrong appointment. Not because he cannot turn the club round.\n\n\n\nThe drama of the win over Blackburn Rovers is precisely the type of energy Sunderland hoped the new manager would bring. The problem is that even in the short time O'Neill has been out of football, the rules of engagement have changed. The ambition he once shared with Randy Lerner at Aston Villa is no longer legal.\n\n\n\nAt Sunderland, O'Neill must learn to know his place. And what a dead end street it is.\n\n\n\nSunderland have never benefited from the riches and global profile of the modern European game, so have a limited fan base at home and abroad. So even if O'Neill persuaded Ellis Short, the owner, to spend big in pursuit of a dream, those plans would be strangled at birth.\n\n\n\nSunderland are not allowed to grow through owner investment, so O'Neill's fantasy of one day producing a team to play like Barcelona will remain just that.\n\n\n\nThere are only two ways Sunderland can challenge the elite: the first is to buy a way in, which is no longer permitted; the second is to produce young players of such brilliance that massive improvement occurs organically.\n\nNet result: David Vaughan starts Sunderland's revival against Blackburn, but the gap between the club and the European elite grows by the day\n\nAnd good luck with that. At the first sign of promise, one of UEFA's anointed few will swoop and the player will be lost. Where is Jordan Henderson now? Where is Wayne Rooney? Andy Carroll? Phil Jones?\n\n\n\nAs the regulations that limit a club's potential begin to bite, the appeal of playing for a club of Sunderland's stature will reduce further. More than ever, the focus will be on a well-established elite; and top of that pile will be Manchester United.\n\n\n\nSo if O'Neill wishes to coach the next Barcelona he has one hope. It is that, short-term, United's pains worsen, Ferguson tires of the struggle and the enterprising manager of Sunderland becomes his successor.\n\n\n\nAlthough, quite who will want O'Neill's old job by then remains to be seen.\n\nVidic injury is just so cruel\n\nNews that Nemanja Vidic has damaged three major ligaments in his right knee and could be out for a year is a crushing blow for the player and for Manchester United.\n\nVidic may well be 31 by the time he returns and even with advances in modern sports science it is ambitious to believe he can achieve the same physical standard having sustained such a serious injury late in his career.\n\nWith pace a vital factor in the modern game, and Rio Ferdinand also advancing in years, this may be the beginning of the end for the United captain.\n\nCertainly, he will need every last drop of that famous courage if he is to remain at the top, particularly as Sir Alex Ferguson may have little choice but to recruit a younger replacement.\n\nFootball can be very cruel.\n\nBitter blow: Nemanja Vidic writhes in agony and faces a lengthy absence from the game\n\nDalglish argument flawed\n\nKenny Dalglish has a gripe with the Football Association and would certainly deserve sympathy if highlighting inconsistency in the decision to charge Luis Suarez for a rude gesture at Fulham fans.\n\nHis view that the FA are now compromised as a disciplinary body, however, having successfully appealed against Wayne Rooney's three-match ban with UEFA, is flawed.\n\nUnless there are extraordinary circumstances, a player receiving a red card in domestic football is given an automatic statutory suspension, to expedite the process.\n\nAppeals are therefore a complication, and if considered unnecessary or frivolous, carry the potential for additional punishment. UEFA's system is very different, with each case considered on merit and open to question. That is why the FA cited precedents of more lenient sentences in Rooney's appeal.\n\nAll clubs agreed to the FA process so cases were administered swiftly and fairly, with finite boundaries; if UEFA went by these rules, too, Dalglish may have a point. As it is, there is no argument.\n\nEuropa League IS second best\n\nHow childish of Michel Platini, the UEFA president, to link Manchester United's disappointment at playing in the Europa League to his stereotypical perception of English arrogance.\n\n'The world does not revolve around England,' he sniffed. 'You shouldn't criticise the Europa League because you've played in three Champions League finals.'\n\nYet Sir Alex Ferguson wasn't criticising. He was merely expressing his regret at the disruption to United's season, caused by falling into an inferior competition.\n\nAny elite club, from any major footballing nation in Europe, would have similar concerns. Platini is delusional if he does not accept how the Europa League is perceived. Matches are played on Thursday, for heaven's sake; of course it is second best.\n\nWembley glory was Brum do\n\nBirmingham City are in financial crisis after the assets of owner Carson Yeung were frozen, following charges of money laundering in Hong Kong. The bank has withdrawn the club's overdraft facility and more players will have to be sold in the January transfer window.\n\nAssets frozen: Carson Yeung\n\nThe fact is, Yeung's purchase of Birmingham was always suspect, teetering on the brink of collapse in the early days, and stuffed full of grand promises which bore little scrutiny. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger seems greatly bothered about Manchester City these days, but it is the defeat by Birmingham in the Carling Cup final that is the real travesty, founded on money the victors plainly did not have.\n\nThe same could be said of that other very modern fairy-tale, Portsmouth's FA Cup final win in 2008. Almost since that day, the fortunes of the club have spiralled downwards, through several charlatan owners, until the present crisis finds Portsmouth chief Vladimir Antonov under arrest for alleged large scale bank fraud and forgery. Another financial collapse beckons.\n\nIt is worth noting that Antonov was introduced to the club by noted broker, banker and former Football League chairman Keith Harris, who schemed to buy Manchester United with his ill-fated Red Knights consortium. One can only hope a more reliable calibre of investor was lined up for Old Trafford.\n\nPSG are no match for Tevez ego\n\nBad choice: City's Carlos Tevez\n\nRepresentatives of Carlos Tevez met AC Milan to discuss a January loan move. One problem with that: third parties do not own the rights to the player any more.\n\nIt cost West Ham \ufffd30million to discover such arrangements are not allowed in English football, meaning Manchester City must agree the Tevez deal, and they want him off the books permanently.\n\nJuventus are willing to pay \ufffd20m, placing Tevez in roughly the same price band as Darren Bent, which leaves Paris Saint-Germain, newly awash with Qatari loot and willing to splash it on any name that will put them on the map.\n\nPSG are another City. High on ambition but low on prestige; a work in progress. Tevez would arrive trailing his giant ego, convinced he is doing them a favour, just as he did at City. Monsieur, beware.\n\nOld Firm on tour\n\nThe Scottish Premier League are discussing taking one of the Old Firm derby matches abroad, after discovering keen interest from Qatar.\n\nThis would not follow quite the same principle as the 39th game although, coincidentally, that is the number of times Celtic and Rangers seem to meet each season.\n\nUnited front?\n\nAndre Villas-Boas has asked Chelsea's players to include him, and his staff, in goal celebrations. He believes this shows they are united. If he has to request a cuddle, however, it rather suggests they aren't.\n\nNo surprises there\n\nJerome Valcke, secretary general of FIFA, says that gala affairs such as the annual players' awards dinner could not be held in England because the organisation does not feel welcome here. Pat yourselves on the back for that, everybody.\n\nAND WHILE WE'RE AT IT...\n\nEnjoy the anonymity\n\nThere were no calls for the head of Jason Lee this week; no excitable front page demands for his squad to be brought home in disgrace; no effigies of individual players burned outside pubs.\n\nHe was not depicted as a turnip, or a wally, and a flick round the radio dial would have located no phone-in discussions of his tactics, team selections or choice of training camp.\n\nYet Lee is the coach of Great Britain's hockey team. And at the Champions Trophy tournament in New Zealand, his players have contrived to lose 4-1 to Australia, 8-1 to Spain and have been beaten by Germany, twice. And this with the Olympics next year.\n\n'The result spoke volumes about Britain's resolve,' stated one report after England's first defeat by the Germans. Not that we're easily pleased.\n\nSo the next time a figure from a major sport is up at some specious awards ceremony, to mass grumbling that ironman triathletes, taekwondo champions and open water swimmers are going unrecognised, just remember the difference external pressure makes.\n\nEngland's hockey players will return from New Zealand this week to continue lives of pleasant anonymity, without public recrimination or condemnation.\n\nDented pride aside, they will go about their business unchallenged, walk down the street without meeting a negative word or action.\n\nWith the same results, the footballers would be in hiding. The life may be good, the money is great, but there is a reason those big mock Tudor houses are surrounded by even bigger fences. It's just in case England lose to Spain - and it wouldn't have to be an 8-1 scoreline, either.\n\nWhy increase the tension?\n\nAvoiding the Republic of Ireland in the European Championship finals draw means England are now free to arrange an anticipated warm-up match in Dublin.\n\nYet who in their right mind would do that? While the phrase 'No surrender' is still inserted into the national anthem by a section of England's support - and it is - Dublin should be considered off limits.\n\nThere are plenty of places Fabio Capello's team can travel without tension. In Ireland it comes with the territory.\n\nThe last match there, in 1995, had to be abandoned due to the behaviour of England's fans and nobody can guarantee a return 17 years later will be different. The players do not need this distraction while preparing for a major tournament.\n\nWhatever the incentives, it is a foolish risk. If the names come out of the hat in a qualifying draw and England have to play, that is different; but why invite unnecessary trouble?\n\nLast time out: England fans throw missiles onto Lansdowne Road pitch\n\nAshton has to learn\n\nChris Ashton should use his month out of rugby to do some serious thinking. When he broke into the England team, his exciting play, flamboyant style and daffy personality drew comparisons with the young Paul Gascoigne. They were intended as a compliment.\n\nThe likeness remains, but it is no longer a positive. Like Gascoigne, Ashton has developed a propensity for trouble; he is on the fringes of every row, every scandal, each indignity to befall his sport.\n\nHe is being advised to cash in on his fame fast, while blaming every setback on his celebrity status and the media spotlight it brings. This is a good moment to take stock.\n\nThere is a decent bloke who is not being represented, a fine rugby player and a man who can lift his sport, if he channels his energy in the right way.\n\nGascoigne was the same. He chose a different path; it is not too late for Ashton to learn from his mistakes.\n\nChannel his energies: Chris Ashton\n\nEqual billing\n\nWith uncanny timing, the BBC has delivered a shortlist for Young Sports Personality of the Year that is entirely female, neatly countering the roll of honour for Sports Personality of the Year that was completely male.\n\nNow Lucy Garner, the world junior road race cycling champion, Paralympic swimmer Eleanor Simmonds, who won four medals at the European Championships, and Lauren Taylor, youngest winner of golf's Ladies' British Amateur Championship at 17, will never know if it was their ability that earned the prize, or the ham-fisted management of a media storm. So nobody wins.\n\nMore Plastic Brits\n\nThere will be 25 wrestling mats in use during the London Olympics, and when the competition is over, all will be returned to the manufacturers in France.\n\nAs pointed out by Raphael Martinetti, president of wrestling's governing body, Fila, when he arrived in the capital for a test event this week, the Olympic legacy in the sport will be close to non-existent.\n\nThat is because, as noted here, the home team is stuffed full of Plastic Brits, mostly Ukrainians plus the odd Bulgarian, who came in to assist with coaching and then usurped the home-grown competitors.\n\nFila are partly to blame, for making switches of nationality so negotiable, but Martinetti's frustration at Team GB's naked ambition is justified.\n\n'This leaves no legacy from the Games,' he said. 'It is not good for the country. It is totally stupid.' He was being polite.\n\nActually, it is worse. Put bluntly, in spirit at least, it is cheating.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

London Olympics countdown enters its final 200 days with government and organisers believing there is a legacy Britain can look forward to long after the last medal has been won and the show is over.\n\n\n\nOn the day three more Games venues had their future ownership announced, Prime Minister David Cameron held his first cabinet meeting of the New Year at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London.\n\n\n\n'I want the message to go out loud and clear, from tourism to business, sport to investment, we are determined to maximise the benefits of 2012 for the whole country,' Cameron said.\n\n\n\nCalling the shots: Cameron leads the debate during the Cabinet meeting at the handball arena in Stratford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'Today, as we mark 200 days to go, and six out of the eight Olympic venues having already secured their future, we are well on track to delivering a lasting legacy for the whole of Britain.'\n\nSporting legacy and the economic regeneration of a run-down area of east London, without the facilities becoming a drain on public finances after the Games, were central to London's successful bid in 2005 but critics have questioned how much money the government can recoup.\n\n\n\nConstruction giant Balfour Beatty PLC will take over the running of the Olympic Park, which includes the 115 metre high AccelorMittal Orbit feature, in a 10-year \u00a350m deal.\n\nAll aboard: PM Cameron and deputy Clegg board the train to Stratford and share a joke en route (below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wave-shaped Aquatics Centre and multi-use Handball Arena will be operated by locally based Greenwich Leisure Limited.\n\n\n\nThe new contracts will create at least 254 jobs on the Park, whose estate management and maintenance has also been secured, and means six of eight permanent venues now have a clear ownership beyond the Games.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, The Government expects the Orbit, a landmark helter-skelter of a structure designed by artist Anish Kapoor and taller than New York's Statue of Liberty, to attract up to a million visitors a year.\n\n\n\nAlmost there: The Olympic Park in Stratford is nearing completion\n\nThey hope the Aquatics Centre could see 800,000 users a year as a local community facility accessible to all as well as remaining a venue for world class events.\n\nThe multi-use Arena will become the capital's third largest, hosting up to half a million visitors a year to concerts, exhibitions and sports events.\n\nThe remaining two venues yet to have confirmed legacy operators are the main stadium, which has cost \u00a3486m to build, and the international broadcast and press centre.\n\n\n\n'To find operators to take over these world class facilities so far ahead of the Games and to secure their commitment to spread jobs and opportunities throughout the local communities is the icing on the 2012 cake,' said London mayor Boris Johnson.\n\n\n\nFinal countdown: The Olympic clock in Trafalgar Square (above) while children mark the event at the British embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia (below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'We can now start the run in to a fantastic year of celebration with huge pride and optimism that London will stage a great Games, delivering lasting sustainable benefits long after the athletes have departed.'\n\nThe Government has moved to calm security fears after Police carrying out tests managed to smuggle a fake bomb onto the main site. While the Olympic Delivery Authority declined to directly comment on the incident, it said 'testing is standard practice' in all major security operations.\n\n\n\n'Such tests have a key role in developing our capability to ensure that London 2012 is safe and secure and that we are best prepared to detect potential threats before and during the Games,\" a statement said.\n\n\n\n'Members of the public with tickets should be reassured that such exercises are being staged to ensure their safety, our number one priority.'\n\nGet involved: British Ambassador Mark Canning (centre) with Indonesian students in Jakarta\n\nAnd organisers are still grappling with yet another ticketing problem. A limited ticket sale has been suspended indefinitely after computer problems kept causing trouble for buyers.\n\n\n\nThe tickets came from customers who decided to submit them for resale, but the online system did not work properly and sales remained suspended Monday, a spokeswoman for the organising committee said.\n\n", "images":

spy probe", "text": "Fourth man arrested in Olympic stadium spy probe\n\nA fourth suspect was arrested on Wednesday by detectives investigating allegations that Tottenham Hotspur spied on Olympic officials during its stadium bid.\n\nScotland Yard said a 45-year-old man was being held at a south London police station after his property was searched.\n\nThe investigation surrounds allegations by West Ham United and the Olympic Park Legacy Company 'in respect of the unlawful obtaining of information', the force said.\n\nSources said an 'amount of material was seized' during the search.\n\nThree other men, aged 29, 39 and 57, have been arrested in recent months during the inquiry by the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Economic and Specialist Crime Command.\n\nArrest: Police have made a fourth arrest in connection with spying\n\nOlympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) chairwoman Baroness Ford claimed in November that the north London football club had all 14 members of her board monitored by private investigators.\n\nSpurs deny putting officials under surveillance.\n\nA deal with West Ham and Newham Council to use the stadium in Stratford, east London, after the 2012 Games collapsed in October last year, with the Government announcing that the stadium would remain in public ownership.\n\nTottenham had already lost out to West Ham in the race to become the OPLC\u2019s first choice to move into the stadium after the Olympics.\n\nChallenges by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, plus an anonymous complaint to the European Commission, had led to fears that court action could drag on for years while the stadium remained empty.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

into the red and main stadium could become a white elephant", "text": "Olympics may go \u00a32bn into the red and main stadium could become a white elephant, MPs warn\n\n\n\nThe Olympics may go nearly \u00a32billion over budget, MPs warned yesterday.\n\n\n\nTheir report into the London Games also raised concerns about the Olympic legacy and the danger of the main stadium becoming a white elephant.\n\n\n\nMargaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \u2018The Olympic Delivery Authority\u2019s management of the building programme has been exemplary.\n\n\n\nConcern: MPs have a very real worry that the Olympic Stadium will become a white elephant\n\n\u2018However, the \u00a39.3billion public sector funding package is close to being used up and we are concerned about whether the running of the Games will be within budget.\n\n\n\n\u2018Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around \u00a311billion.\u2019\n\n\n\nShe highlighted the fact that the bill for security is expected to double because of the need for more guards.\n\n\u2018We are particularly concerned about the significant increases in the security bill. It is staggering that the original estimates were so wrong,\u2019 she said.\n\n\n\nThe report states that the LOCOG organising committee has been forced to renegotiate a contract for venue security from a \u2018weak negotiating position\u2019.\n\n\n\nWorried: The Commons Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge is concerned that public sector funding for the Olympics has almost run out\n\nMrs Hodge added: \u2018There is a big question mark over whether it secured a good deal for the taxpayer.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe original estimate for the number of security guards in and around the venues was 10,000 \u2013 a \u2018finger in the air estimate\u2019, according to the Commons report.\n\n\n\nThe Government announced in December that the figure has more than doubled to 23,700. Security costs from the Olympics budget have risen from \u00a3282million to \u00a3553million.\n\n\n\n\u2018LOCOG itself now has almost no contingency left to meet further costs, even though it has done well in its revenue generation,\u2019 says the report. On legacy issues, the committee raised concerns over targets to increase participation in sport and on finding a use for the main stadium after a deal with West Ham United Football Club collapsed.\n\n\n\n\u2018We were promised a strong Olympic legacy but the Government has chosen not to adopt the target of one million more people participating in sport by 2013, and plans for the stadium have fallen through,\u2019 said Mrs Hodge.\n\n\n\n\u2018It must not become a white elephant. The Government is dispersing responsibility for delivering the legacy and we need clarity about who is accountable.\u2019\n\n", "images":

red", "text": "The Olympics may go nearly \u00a32billion over budget, MPs warned yesterday.\n\nTheir report into the London Games also raised concerns about the Olympic legacy and the danger of the main stadium becoming a white elephant.\n\nMargaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: \u2018The Olympic Delivery Authority\u2019s management of the building programme has been exemplary.\n\nConcern: MPs have a very real worry that the Olympic Stadium will become a white elephant\n\n\u2018However, the \u00a39.3billion public sector funding package is close to being used up and we are concerned about whether the running of the Games will be within budget.\n\nClick here to resize this module\n\n\u2018Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around \u00a311billion.\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nShe highlighted the fact that the bill for security is expected to double because of the need for more guards.\n\n\u2018We are particularly concerned about the significant increases in the security bill. It is staggering that the original estimates were so wrong,\u2019 she said.\n\nThe report states that the LOCOG organising committee has been forced to renegotiate a contract for venue security from a \u2018weak negotiating position\u2019.\n\nWorried: The Commons Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge is concerned that public sector funding for the Olympics has almost run out\n\nMrs Hodge added: \u2018There is a big question mark over whether it secured a good deal for the taxpayer.\u2019\n\nThe original estimate for the number of security guards in and around the venues was 10,000 \u2013 a \u2018finger in the air estimate\u2019, according to the Commons report.\n\nThe Government announced in December that the figure has more than doubled to 23,700. Security costs from the Olympics budget have risen from \u00a3282million to \u00a3553million.\n\n\u2018LOCOG itself now has almost no contingency left to meet further costs, even though it has done well in its revenue generation,\u2019 says the report. On legacy issues, the committee raised concerns over targets to increase participation in sport and on finding a use for the main stadium after a deal with West Ham United Football Club collapsed.\n\n\u2018We were promised a strong Olympic legacy but the Government has chosen not to adopt the target of one million more people participating in sport by 2013, and plans for the stadium have fallen through,\u2019 said Mrs Hodge.\n\n\u2018It must not become a white elephant. The Government is dispersing responsibility for delivering the legacy and we need clarity about who is accountable.\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \u2018With 140 days to go until the Olympic Games, we are on time and under budget, with over \u00a3500million worth of uncommitted contingency remaining. We are in a strong position and, while we can\u2019t be complacent, are confident that we can deliver the Games under budget.\u2019", "images":

taxpayer \u00a311billion, report warns\n\nSecurity estimates have rocketed from \u00a3282million to \u00a3553million\n\nEvent in danger of becoming 'white elephant', say MPs\n\n\n\nCritical: Margaret Hodge, pictured, said it was 'staggering' that security estimates were so wrong\n\nThe London 2012 Olympics is running \u00a32billion over budget, with planning for the event so poor that security costs have doubled, a damning report has revealed.\n\n\n\nMPs said it was 'staggering' that security estimates had soared from \u00a3282million to \u00a3553million when London only learned it would be hosting the Games a day before the 7/7 bombings.\n\nThe swelling budget for security has helped to push the likely total cost of the Olympics towards \u00a311billion - well above the \u00a39.3billion that the Government has set aside for the sporting spectacular, the Commons Public Accounts Committee found.\n\nThe committee's report also raised concerns about the legacy of the Games and warned that the Olympic Stadium must not become a white elephant.\n\nThe Government has continued to insist it is confident the Games will come in under budget.\n\nBut the London organising committee (Locog) now needs more than twice the number of security guards it expected.\n\nThe report said Locog's initial assessment that 10,000 guards were required was simply a 'finger in the air' estimate.\n\n\n\nMargaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: 'The venues and infrastructure of the London Olympic Games are on track to be delivered on time and within budget.\n\n'The Olympic Delivery Authority's management of the building programme has been exemplary.\n\n\n\n'However, the \u00a39.3billion public sector funding package is close to being used up and we are concerned about whether the running of the Games will be held within budget.\n\n\n\n'Taking into account costs outside the package, the full cost to the public of the Games and legacy projects is already heading for around \u00a311billion.'\n\nThe Olympics have long been regarded a potential terrorist target, and London learned it would host the Games on July 6, 2005 - only a day before 7/7 suicide bombers Mohammed Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer, Hasib Hussain and Jermaine Lindslay blew themselves up on the capital's public transport network.\n\nFifty-two innocent victims were killed in the atrocity.\n\n\n\nMrs Hodge said: 'We are particularly concerned about the significant increases in the security bill.\n\n'Locog (the London organising committee) now needs more than twice the number of security guards it originally estimated and the costs have roughly doubled.\n\n\n\n'It is staggering that the original estimates were so wrong.'\n\n\n\nAlmost ready: The Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, and other 2012 venues are on track to be delivered on time and under budget\n\nThe report states that Locog has been forced to renegotiate its contract with G4S for venue security from a 'weak negotiating position'.\n\n\n\nMrs Hodge added: \"There is a big question mark over whether it secured a good deal for the taxpayer.'\n\n\n\nLocog's original estimate for the number of security guards in and around the venues was 10,000 - a 'finger in the air estimate', according to the report.\n\nThe Government announced in December that figure has more than doubled to 23,700.\n\n'Locog itself now has almost no contingency left to meet further costs, even though it has done well in its revenue generation,' says the report.\n\nThe committee also raised concerns about how many Britons would take part in sport after the Games, as well as questioning the future of the Olympic stadium after a deal for West Ham United to take it over fell through.\n\nMs Hodge added: 'We were promised a strong Olympic legacy but the Government has chosen not to adopt the target of one million more people participating in sport by 2013, and plans for the stadium have fallen through.\n\nChampion: It was hoped the success of stars like Jessica Ennis would inspire one million more people to participate in sport by 2013, but the Government chose not to adopt the target\n\n'It must not become a white elephant.\n\n\n\n'The Government is dispersing responsibility for delivering the legacy and we need clarity about who is accountable.'\n\n\n\nThe report states that with only 109,000 new people regularly participating in sport against the original one million target - which the new Government chose not to adopt - the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has got 'poor value for money' for the \u00a3450 million spent through national governing bodies.\n\n\n\n'It is unclear what the sporting participation legacy of the Games is intended to be,' says the report.\n\nTerror threat: The announcement that London would host the 2012 games was made a day before the 7/7 attacks\n\nSuicide plot: 7/7 bombers, left to right, Hasib Hussain, Shehzad Tanweer, Jermaine Lindsay and Mohammad Sidique Khan\n\nDCMS rejected the figure of \u00a311 billion of public money being spent on the Games and defended the legacy aims.\n\n\n\nA DCMS spokesman said: 'With 140 days to go until the Olympic Games, we are on time and under budget, with over \u00a3500million worth of uncommitted contingency remaining.\n\n'We are in a strong position and, while we can't be complacent, are confident that we can deliver the Games under budget.\n\n\n\n'As we told the Public Accounts Committee in December we do not recognise the figure of \u00a311 billion.\n\n'We have always been transparent about what is included in the \u00a39.3billion.\n\nAssurance: Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson told MPs he expected the Games to come in under budget\n\n'The cost of purchasing the Olympic Park land will ultimately come back to the public purse through the resale of the land after the Games and was therefore not included.\n\n\n\n'Funding for the legacy programmes, that the Public Accounts Committee refer to, comes from existing business-as-usual budgets and we have been clear about this.\n\n'These are for projects designed to capitalise on hosting London 2012 but are not an additional Olympic cost.'\n\n\n\nDCMS said the legacy included regenerating part of east London and that tenants have been secured for six out of eight venues on the Olympic Park, and that a number of campaigns including the Youth Sport Strategy and the School Games strategies legacy were inspiring a generation to play sport.\n\nThe report was released less than a fortnight after Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson told MPs that he expected confirmation the sporting spectacular would come in under budget.\n\n\n\n'We are on track, on time and just under budget to deliver a great games,' he said.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

Waterfield", "text": "We need a China crisis to claim gold in London, warns diving star Waterfield\n\n\n\nPete Waterfield believes he and diving partner Tom Daley have the ability to win gold at the Olympics \u2013 but only if the Chinese favourites slip-up.\n\nThe British pair, who compete in the 10m platform, claimed silver in the latest round of the FINA World Series in Beijing last week, and Waterfield said the result added momentum to their preparations for London.\n\n\n\nSilver service: Waterfield (right) fears the Chinese duo might be tough to beat\n\nHome duo Cao Yuan and Zhang Yanquan finished first at the Water Cube in China, but Waterfield thinks the gap is closing.\n\n\n\n'We are catching them,' he told Sportsmail. 'As long as we go into the Olympics fully fit and have worked as hard as we can, all we need to do is put pressure on them.\n\n'We've seen in the past that putting by pressure on them, they do miss dives. Gold is definitely not out of reach. But if they don't miss their dives you're going to struggle.'\n\n\n\nWaterfield and Daly beat the same Chinese pairing at last year's World Series in Sheffield after they had faltered.\n\n\n\nPerfect symmetry: The duo took silver last week in Beijing\n\nAt the World Series event last week, Daly also took individual silver, while Waterfield added individual bronze.\n\n\n\nThe 31-year-old said rivalry between the two was inevitable but that it remained friendly.\n\n\n\nWaterfield added: 'That's just the way our sport is, we understand that. And even though we we're competing against each other we still want the other to do well.\n\n\n\nImprovement: Waterfield and Daley bettered their London showing in Beijing\n\n'Obviously I don't want him to beat me and I'm sure he doesn't want me to beat him but in China, we were both on the rostrum. That's the ideal world. If we can do that in London that would be great.'\n\n\n\nThe result in Beijing was a marked improvement on the duo's showing at the test event at the Olympic Aquatics Centre in February, where a mistake on their difficult 4.5 somersault dive left them down in seventh spot.\n\n'We've been working on that dive and it went a lot better in China,' Waterfield added.\n\n'But we could still improve. In the individual we've both done it for, like, nines. 'If we put the two individual ones together then the four and a half will be right on. It's definitely coming along, I think we still scored seven and a halves, eights in the synchro so it's definitely better than where it was.'\n\n\n\nNext up for Waterfield is a two week break before he heads to Moscow and Tijuana in Mexico for the third and fourth World Series events.\n\n\n\nHe was speaking at Durand Academy in London as the Crystal Palace England Diving Talent Centre tested the 100,000th school child in their search for diving's next generation of athletes.\n\n\n\nThe programme, headed by former diving world champion Chris Snode, has been running for four years, and is designed to unearth diving talent by examining children's physical attributes and inviting them for coaching sessions.\n\n\n\nThe Durand Academy children were put through their paces by jumping, stretching, and testing their balance, with several pupils selected for further coaching.\n\n'Programmes like this are fantastic for unearthing the Olympic stars of tomorrow,' said Waterfield.\n\n\n\n'I stumbled across diving when I was a kid but the testing programme makes sure that talent is spotted an early age and that the children can benefit from the world class coaching at Crystal Palace Diving Club.'\n\n\n\nThe school is in Vauxhall MP Kate Hoey's constituency and the former sports minister was also in attendance.\n\n\n\nShe said: 'The key to a true Olympic legacy rests with instilling a lifelong passion for sport in our children.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

tower in 26-acre suburb near London's 2012 park", "text": "Olympic torch: Flat-pack giant Ikea lights the way with 40m high tower in 26-acre suburb near London's 2012 park\n\n\n\nA giant 40 metre illuminated tower will light up the East London skyline when a new 26-acre development is built by Ikea.\n\nVisible for miles, the sculpture which resembles the Olympic Torch, will be lit at night with more than 600 LED lights.\n\nAt the flick of a switch, the colour and intensity of the bulbs will be able to change to produce a range of dramatic effects set to dazzle the night sky over London.\n\n\n\nDramatic: An image of what the tower will look like against the backdrop of the night's sky\n\nThe sculpture - which should be finished in July - is being built in new development called Strand East, in Stratford, East London.\n\n\n\nIt will be made from a simple, wooden lattice of 72 twisted, diagonal laths and 16 horizontal steel rings held together by 32,000 bolts.\n\n\n\nThe development will be split into five areas each with its own distinctive identity and design approach with the tower rising in the North East Quarter which will focus on creativity and the arts.\n\n\n\nAndrew Cobden, spokesman for the development, said: 'We are very excited to see the sculpture going up and the public space at Dane\u2019s Yard coming to life.\n\n\n\n'It will be a beautiful landmark for the site and we hope local communities will also enjoy it.'\n\nIkea announced it would be moving into the property business last year when it revealed the new development near the Olympic Park.\n\nThe sky's the limit: The dramatic new 40m tower promises to bring the Ikea development to life\n\nStrand East will contain 1,200 new homes, 480,000 square feet of offices and a 350-bedroom hotel in Stratford, east London.\n\n\n\nThe tower being built in Stratford, London\n\nIt is the first major British development for LandProp, part of the Inter Ikea Group, which owns the intellectual assets of the furniture chain.\n\nThe company is believed to have paid about \u00a325million for the site, which had previously been in receivership.\n\nIt is the second biggest private-sector project in the Olympic Park, after the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre which opened last year.\n\n'Not only does it create a new high quality, waterside destination which provides new homes, jobs and leisure facilities, it is a demonstration of investor confidence in the area's future in a difficult market,' Olympic Legacy Minister Bob Neill said.\n\nThe development's canalside location has led to it being called a 'mini Venice', and it will boast a boat taxi service and a floating cocktail bar.\n\nHe added that although London would be the focus of its UK activities as 'the machine that will always work', the company was already assembling sites in undisclosed locations around the UK.\n\nThe development company already operates in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Holland among other countries.\n\nPlans: Strand East will stand in the shadow of the Olympic stadium in east\n\nThe planning application was submitted to London Thames Gateway Development Corporation and was passed by the London Borough of Newham.\n\n\n\nAround 25 per cent of the development will be open space, including a riverside park that will run along the western edge of the site overlooking the River Lee.\n\nThere will be a new bus route for the neighbourhood along with walkways and cycle routes leading to Stratford High Street.\n\n\n\n", "images":

canoe sprint squad", "text": "Olympic veteran Brabants heads up Team GB canoe sprint squad\n\nTim Brabants is among the nine athletes selected by the British Olympic Association to represent Team GB in the flat-water Canoe Sprint at London 2012.\n\nBrabants, Edward McKeever, Liam Heath, Jonathan Schofield, Jessica Walker, Rachel Cawthorn, Angela Hannah and Louisa Sawers will compete in the kayak across six events, with Richard Jefferies racing in the canoe in two events.\n\nBrabants, competing in his fourth Games, will be defending the K1 1000m crown he won in Beijing four years ago.\n\nTeam: The canoe squad\n\nLondon-born Brabants also picked up a bronze in the K1 500m event but he became the first Briton to win a gold medal in either the sprint or slalom kayak discipline after leading from start to finish.\n\nTeam GB chef de mission Andy Hunt said: 'The Canoe Sprint team has really progressed since Tim Brabants won the first ever medal for Team GB by taking bronze in Sydney back in 2000.\n\nWarming up: Liam Heath and Jonathan Schofield in training\n\n'Having a veteran and defending Olympic champion like Tim in the team will be a huge inspiration to everyone involved, and it is a chance for the younger competitors and the debutants to use that kind of motivation to create their own Olympic legacy.'\n\nThe 35-year-old had to come through a best-of-three race-off with compatriot Paul Wycherley to secure his place in this year\u2019s Games, however.\n\nHe said: 'I am really excited to be selected for my fourth Olympic Games. Now the selection process is complete, I can really focus on defending my Olympic title in London 2012.'\n\nVeteran: Tim Brabants has been to several Games\n\nThis year\u2019s Olympics marks the first time 200m events have been included, with Heath and Schofield expected to shine in the men\u2019s K2 after winning two silver medals in their World Cup events as well as a silver medal at the 2011 World Championships in Szeged.\n\nMcKeever and Walker line-up in the individual 200m men\u2019s and women\u2019s events respectively, while sole British canoeist Jefferies will also compete in the shorter format as well as the C1 1000m.\n\nRachel Cawthorn became the first British woman to win a medal at the world championships with bronze in Poznan two years ago and will compete in the women\u2019s K1 500m in London.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

an Olympic boost", "text": "Small businesses are expected to account for more than half of a multi-billion pound boost to the economy as a result of the Olympics coming to Britain.\n\nOfficial sponsor Lloyds TSB says the Games will have brought \u00a316.5billion to the UK between 2005, when they were awarded to London, and 2017. Construction is expected to generate \u00a313.5billion and tourism \u00a32billion.\n\nLloyds found that \u00a38.06billion - 52 per cent of the uplift from construction and tourism - will be delivered by small and medium-sized firms, including taxi drivers, restaurants and suppliers. London is expected to deliver \u00a36billion and other parts of the UK the remaining \u00a310.5billion.\n\nDavid Cameron says he expects the Games to bring in \u00a313billion in the next four years alone.\n\nClick here to resize this module\n\nDuring the six weeks from the start of the Olympics to the end of the Paralympics, the British Business Embassy, which has been set up by the Government's export agency UK Trade & Investment for the Games, will host 17 global business summits at Lancaster House, central London, to connect companies with investors and drum up business for Britain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, concerns that disruption over the Games could drive business from some firms remain and there has been criticism that firms out of London feel detached from potential benefits.\n\nThe Federation of Small Businesses has warned that the Olympic legacy could be a damp squib for small firms and could have been far greater if the Government had not been so intent on protecting headline sponsors.\n\nBut Lawrence Mallinson is one entrepreneur who has already benefited from a boost to his firm. He is the boss of James White drinks in Ashbocking, near Ipswich, which he took over 24 years ago. At the time it was a cider-maker but was struggling to survive and had been turned down for finance by the banks.\n\nNow a juice-maker, its new product, a beetroot juice called Beet-It, is being requested by athletes at the Games. Teams from Norway, Canada, Australia, Britain, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Belgium have ordered supplies.\n\nLawrence, 54, an accountant and a founder of the New Covent Garden Soup Company, says: 'When we first did beetroot juice I thought it was a very small market. Yet last month we had sales of \u00a356,000 for the 2\u00bdfl oz [70ml] concentrated shots alone, fuelled by the Olympic teams.\n\n'The shots now account for about ten per cent of the business, while Beet-It accounts for half of the \u00a35million turnover.'\n\nAnd while London's commercial property market is expected to come to a virtual standstill during the Games, one agency has set its sights on the wealth of international business opportunities the event promises to bring.\n\nDeVono Property currently finds and acquires offices for British firms moving into central London, where it is based. It intends to use the slowdown to steal a march on its competitors.\n\nDirector Adam Landau, 33, who founded the agency in 2003 with co-director Robert Leigh, also 33, anticipates a 30 per cent jump in its client base and expects to turn over \u00a32.5million this year.\n\nHe says: 'We've had our Olympic strategy in place for months. We know who's coming and have meetings arranged. These include a number of fast-growth, technology-related firms from the US that typically aim to expand their workforces fivefold within two or three years and are looking at overseas investment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n'We are a local company that has never had a global presence, but thanks to a high-profile event like the Olympics, we believe that is about to change.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/09/article-0-13F67E9A000005DC-30_1024x615_large.jpg"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/09/article-0-13F67E9A000005DC-30_1024x615_large.jpg", "date": "09/07/2012"}, "rank_247": {"title": "Team GB fans need to make some songs - Laura Williamson", "text": "Laura Williamson: We're in tune but we need to get on song too\n\nGB or not GB: that is the question. What do we call our \u2018greatest team\u2019? Great Britain will do for me: this GB nonsense makes us sound like a new American Major League Soccer franchise.\n\n\u2018Come on Great Britain!\u2019, however, does not exactly roll off the tongue.\n\nIt\u2019s something that has proved problematic in the opening days of the Olympic Games: you\u2019ve got your face painted red, white and blue but you haven\u2019t got a clue what to shout.\n\nNeed some chants: 'Team GB' fans don't know what to shout\n\nGreat Britain\u2019s first Olympic football matches both followed a similar pattern.\n\nAt the Millennium Stadium for the women\u2019s game on Wednesday and Old Trafford for the men\u2019s on Thursday there was a huge swell of noise as the teams walked out on to the pitch.\n\nThen, nothing \u2014 just a few boos for Liverpool\u2019s ex-Manchester City striker Craig Bellamy playing at the home of Manchester United.\n\nThis is new territory, watching our first men\u2019s Olympic football team since 1960 and the first women\u2019s side in history, and it exposed a pertinent problem.\n\nWhat are you supposed to sing?\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go GB\u2019?\n\nNo, too American.\n\n\u2018Team GB\u2019? Boring.\n\n\u2018Stuart Pearce\u2019s barmy army\u2019?\n\nMaybe not.\n\n\u2018We only play in a home Games/Play in a home Games\u2026\u2019 might be more appropriate.\n\nThese details matter, you see.\n\nNice one pal: Craig Bellamy congratulates his compatriot Ryan\n\nIt\u2019s the same reason some were so outraged by our Scottish and Welsh footballers\u2019 decision to seal their lips during God Save The Queen.\n\nThese athletes are aiming for personal glory, first and foremost, but they are also representing us \u2014 our Olympic hopes and dreams \u2014 too.\n\nIt\u2019s the same feeling that propels grown men and women to trot proudly around London wearing ill-fitting replica shirts and waving Union flags.\n\nIt\u2019s the often agonising experience of watching a British player at Wimbledon hitting every ball with them and feeling the same peaks and troughs of emotion.\n\nIt\u2019s the wonderful ridiculousness of cheering on a British swimmer you\u2019ve never heard of in the vain hope he or she might sneak into a semi-final or shedding a tear when an athlete in British colours steps up on to the medal podium.\n\nSuper sub: Scott Sinclair put Great Britain 2-1 up\n\nAs we have seen already in this Olympic Games, with record crowds flocking to the men\u2019s road race and Britain\u2019s swimmers marvelling at the partisan swell of noise in the Aquatics Centre, sport means so much more when you feel a sense of identity.\n\nIt\u2019s wonderful to watch, marvel at and appreciate a sporting spectacle as a neutral, but it has so much more impact when it feels like an interactive experience.\n\nShouting at the television isn\u2019t going to make British athletes run quicker or swim faster, but you\u2019ll still do it anyway. All that remains is to find a way to sing when we\u2019re winning.\n\nThey said what?\n\nPress release of the week: \u2018England women on their way\u2019 trumpeted a British Olympic Association press release after Great Britain\u2019s first Olympic women\u2019s football team won their first match. They looked like England in their white shirts and only the English players sang the national anthem, but what happened to \u2018Team\u2019 GB?\n\n...And this is what I've been doing this week\n\nNot much, really. Been quite a quiet one.\n\n\n\nJust football, diving, cycling and beach volleyball on the agenda.\n\nThough, I have a confession to make: is anyone else finding a home Olympics just a little bit emotional? Tissues at the ready.\n\nEmotional: A home games is getting everyone excited\n\nTaking in Hey Ya (which means \u2018Let\u2019s Go\u2019 in Arabic), an exhibition of images and videos about Arab women in sport, at Sotheby\u2019s. My favourite picture was of Mariam Hussein, a Somalian basketball player, bouncing a ball in a pair of Ray-Ban shades. Let\u2019s go, indeed...\n\nSmiling as a girl in a Great Britain replica shirt tried to re-enact Steph Houghton\u2019s winner against New Zealand on the Tube during my journey back from Cardiff on Wednesday. We\u2019ll never be able to measure it, but that\u2019s your Olympic legacy right there.\n\nPerformance of the week", "images":

riot smoke that still hangs over Britain", "text": "The Olympic flame burns bright \u2013 but it\u2019s riot smoke that still hangs over Britain\n\nA year ago, some of our youth were in training for a very different set of games \u2013 the riots that spread through our cities. It seems poor taste to mention them in the midst of the Olympic love-in, but they cast a long shadow.\n\nBuildings near me are gone. They smouldered for days. So did the resentment \u2013 I sniff it still. When it\u2019s sunny in the park I can smell the cider and the skunk, but at night a more sour smell lurks on the streets \u2013 fear.\n\nFor while we celebrate the greatest and the fittest and the highest achievers in our shiny new stadiums, there are people who live right beside these places who feel as excluded from it all as they ever did.\n\nRiots Tottenham August 2011\n\nI am not trying to excuse mindless violence, but we might ask what has changed in the past year.\n\nAll kinds of people fear there will be more riots. The police have repeatedly warned of chaos to come but this is often dismissed as a strategic ploy to stop their numbers being cut.\n\nWhat is most shocking, though, is that when young people themselves are asked, at least a quarter of them believe there will be more riots.\n\nThey are nonchalant about the reasons: boredom, feeling there is no future, peer pressure (everyone is doing it). And because they still cannot afford the things they want.\n\nThose who have been criminalised by the courts for stealing a bottle of water have not suddenly stopped wanting to consume all we are told to consume. Rather their chances of working so they may be able to get it have been lessened by their convictions.\n\nIn the so-called \u2018Olympic boroughs\u2019, youth unemployment is particularly high. These are areas of poor health and few ways out.\n\nIf the Olympic legacy was to help those at the bottom it would have to mean jobs and homes. In reality it has meant the training of some volunteers and another palace of branding \u2013 Westfield shopping centre.\n\nThe Olympic Village, now sold off to the Qataris, is hardly going to provide affordable social housing.\n\n\n\nWarmth, wit and wisdom: Games presenter Claire Balding shows that at least the Games have given girls some real role models\n\nYet one of the legacies after that ravey utopian Opening Ceremony could be a vision of the power of co-operation as well as competition.\n\nIt has also been amazingly refreshing to see \u2018fit\u2019 women \u2013 fit in the proper sense. It\u2019s a break from the flaunting-their-curves, letting-themselves-go on some cocktail of Fake Bake and Heart Break commentary.\n\nInstead we see fine athletes, bodies that sweat, real smiles, total grimacing effort. From Jessica Ennis\u2019s brilliance to the warmth, wit and wisdom of Clare Balding, our girls finally have some role models that are not about sex or shopping.\n\nBUT the harsher reality is that many of the sports we have excelled in require a good income. Hackney and Tower Hamlets are unlikely to produce a Zara Phillips.\n\nIf there is a \u2018legacy\u2019, it could be cheaper and more accessible sports facilities.\n\nLast summer, we witnessed mass vandalism and real hatred towards the police. There was a kind of zombie shopping and absolute hopelessness.\n\nIt was sparked by the police shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham. A year on, police have still not told Duggan\u2019s family why he died, and job prospects in the area are even worse than when the riots started.\n\nThe official response to the riots \u2013 heavy sentences and the assertion that it was all simple \u2018criminality\u2019 \u2013 does not bode well in being able to prevent it happening again.\n\nThe riots were not \u2018political\u2019 but they took place at a time when everything from free higher education, access to decent employment and a home of one\u2019s own was being taken away from young people.\n\nThe Olympics were supposed to be about the regeneration of a cultural and industrial wasteland. But we still have an excluded generation that has been allowed to go to waste.\n\nThat\u2019s why the burning of the Olympic flame is not enough to banish the memories of those who set our cities alight. They didn\u2019t feel they were winning a year ago. They still don\u2019t.\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nThe Dangling Boris, the slow loris of politics, is getting cuter by the day \u2013 if you ignore his bid for world domination. There is a touch of fiddling while Rome burns to it all, but as half of London is a ghost town and the shops are eerily empty, I see no better place for him than suspended mid-air, king of all he surveys, wondering when he can be helped down.\n\n*********************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nRIP Gore Vidal. When asked whether his first sexual experience was with a man or a woman, he replied: \u2018I was too polite to ask.\u2019\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\n\n\nNOW to the big Olympic question: Why does full waxing (including in what we may delicately describe as \u2018the Speedo area\u2019) seem to be de rigueur for male swimmers and cyclists, while some gymnasts, who also need to be aerodynamic, remain hairy? Male grooming looks as if it is a very time-consuming and mysterious Olympic sport.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no honour in murder\n\n\n\nI have long objected to the phrase \u2018honour killing\u2019.\n\nThe word is murder.\n\n\n\nThe abuse and killing of women is not a \u2018cultural practice\u2019 that we must treat differently to any other murder. It is the most abominable way of controlling women. We do not have to dance around the issue of Islam either. This is against every moral law.\n\n\n\nNow that some justice has been achieved for Shafilea Ahmed, a young woman most parents would have been proud of, we must also recognise the bravery of her sister Alesha, who witnessed her murder at 15 and, despite being terrified, finally gave evidence against her parents.\n\n\n\nWives and daughters live in petrified silence but the police are starting to keep records. Last year police reported nearly 3,000 cases of what they call \u2018honour-based\u2019 violence. Very few of these get to court.\n\n\n\nThis silence is deadly. May Shafilea\u2019s death and her sister\u2019s courage be a beacon to those who are suffering, and those who are being bundled off into arranged marriages.\n\n\n\nThe belief women bring shame on to these communities has to be challenged.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26157344-0-image-a-11_1584611009461.jpg",

"date": "05/08/2012"}, "rank_19": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics: Legacy is in our hands - Des Kelly", "text": "The Olympic legacy is in our hands... now let's not waste it\n\n\n\nIt will soon be over. The music will stop, the flags will be packed away and as we stand there wondering where the time went someone will flick the lights out and the greatest party we have ever known will be over. Our world will return to normal.\n\nAnyone touched by the Olympics will bid the Games farewell with a heavy heart. You will know them. They will be acting as if they are at a family gathering, clasping hands, slapping one another on the back and making promises not to leave it quite so long next time.\n\nBut we always do. Real life crowds in. The magical moments slip through our fingers and the extraordinary becomes the everyday once more.\n\nHappy and glorious: Crowds in the Olympic Park lap up the action\n\nWithin 48 hours, the news will no longer be led by great feats of human achievement, but by tales of war, bogus celebrities and economic gloom.\n\nA double dip will not be a gymnastic marvel, but a miserable reminder of national debt. David Cameron and Ed Miliband will still try to score meaningless points from the despatch box, everyone will ignore Nick Clegg, and the people elected to represent the country will bray from the House of Commons benches with all the decorum of bankers on a stag weekend.\n\nThere is even a football match tomorrow featuring two of the biggest clubs in the Premier League. At some point over the course of the season the collision of Manchester City and Chelsea will have sporting significance, but before the end of the Olympics it feels distinctly inappropriate, like a drunken heckle at a memorial service.\n\nBy midweek, Roy Hodgson will be attempting to convince us that England\u2019s footballers can pick up on the Olympian optimism and we\u2019ll sigh, wish it were only true and the memories will fade a little more.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have to let euphoria evaporate just yet. We can click through the snapshots on our cameras or replay the picture book in our heads and remember what a celebration this has been.\n\nIn my mind, I am still sitting trackside on the finish line as Mo Farah wins Britain\u2019s third gold medal on the greatest ever night for the nation\u2019s sport. I remember a man from Barbados cheering on my left; an Australian (!) on my right and how our cries were swept away in the deafening noise rolling down from the grandstands and crashing on to the track.\n\nI have another jewel to keep from \u2018Super Saturday\u2019. It happened when I joined the multitude travelling back into town on the Javelin train. As the doors opened and everyone spilled out on to the platform at St Pancras, there wasn\u2019t the usual commuter scrum and hustle for the gate.\n\nMo-ment of glory: Farah and Bolt (below) have produced some of the most exciting spectacles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, and without prompting, a mighty cheer went up; a spontaneous, collective cry of joy from hundreds of people on their way home who wanted to celebrate the amazing night they had shared together one more time.\n\nThat is the \u2018legacy\u2019 we should keep. For a while, London and Britain was at its best. This wasn\u2019t a bogus Olympic bubble like Beijing. It was a tantalising taste of what real life could be if we are clever enough to sustain it.\n\nJamaican sprinters told the world they loved Birmingham. Female footballers marvelled at the passion of Manchester and Cardiff. People spoke to one another on the London Underground. Shop staff genuinely wanted to help. Folk offered one another assistance with luggage or simple directions. Volunteers at the park were simply happy. London bustled as a metropolis should, but it wasn\u2019t cold or in far too much of a hurry to care. People actually smiled and said \u2018hello\u2019.\n\nWe all loved the sport, of course, but we loved the spirit too.\n\nNaming wrongs Brazil have already scored a horrible own goal with their 2016 Olympic plans after announcing the main athletics arena will be called the Havelange Stadium \u2018in honour\u2019 of an ex-FIFA president who took kickbacks from World Cup television deals in the 1990s.\n\nWhat are they going to call the 2016 cycling arena? The Ronnie Biggs Velodrome?\n\nWe loved the sense of community, the celebration of how wonderful and diverse human beings are. We loved the coming together of people, the understanding that despite colour, creed or politics, we\u2019re all essentially the same. Fundamental bonds were shared across borders, continents, classes and ages.\n\nWinning a race on a track isn\u2019t finding a cure for cancer or splitting the atom, but when a man runs as spectacularly as David Rudisha in setting that new 800m world record, the entire planet can collectively marvel at what humans are capable of.\n\nHere was a Kenyan Masai tribesman, coached by an Irish priest, living in Germany and managed by an Australian being embraced by the rest of the planet.\n\nThere were other incredible stories. The American, Manteo Mitchell, broke his leg during the 4x400 metres relay. He even heard his shinbone snap at the 200m mark. But somehow he kept on running because his team-mates needed him.\n\nWe saw Oscar Pistorius, a man who had both his legs amputated below the knee as a child, run at the Olympics. I\u2019ll say that again; a man missing two legs ran at the Olympics \u2014 the very highest echelon of world sport. If that astonishing achievement doesn\u2019t inspire someone to try and go one step further than they ever thought possible, nothing will. We saw Wojdan Shahrkhani nervously step on to the judo mat at the ExCeL Arena to become Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female Olympian.\n\nHumble crowd: The spectator have even brought humour to the fine art of standing and waiting in line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in her homeland, the cheers were stifled. Saudi newspapers ignored her story in fear of religious hardliners outraged by the presence of a woman at the Games. Shahrkhani was abused, warned Saudi society would shun her family and told she had \u2018thrown away her place in the afterlife\u2019, yet the trembling girl stepped on to the mat anyway.\n\nShahrkhani looked a far cry from being an athlete, never mind a hero, but when the Mecca-born teenager said: \u2018Hopefully this is the beginning of a new era\u2019, we could only applaud.\n\nOne day history may regard her as the Emmeline Pankhurst of the Middle East and place the brief moment of defiant emancipation alongside the Black Power salutes of Tommie Smith and John Carlos in Mexico 1968.\n\nOf course, there was the towering speed and exuberance of Usain Bolt to cherish. But the also-rans were celebrated, too, the runners who trailed in last but were acclaimed like champions.\n\nEnter card details\n\nThe travel website Expedia has signed a deal to sponsor Premier League referees and officials.\n\nI assume this means players can now be booked online.\n\nWhen the leaders crossed the line at the end of the 5,000m qualifier this week, it took another minute and a quarter for 33-year-old Filipino backmarker, Rene Herrera, to make it to the finish.\n\nIt is an eternity at this level but he was urged on as if he were about to break a world\u2019s best. When he slumped to the track, Mo Farah was the first to approach and place a congratulatory hand on his shoulder.\n\nThat is what will define these Games. It was generous. The crowds were patriotic, enthusiastic, but never blindly jingoistic. When the Team GB hockey team was being annihilated by Holland, there were no boos from the crowd. The audience recognised Dutch brilliance.\n\nAnd how\u2019s this for a statistic: 80,203 watched the women\u2019s football final at Wembley between the USA and Japan. If further proof is needed of Britain\u2019s Olympic passion, then it is surely there.\n\nThe only person I can recall being jeered with any genuine gusto throughout the Games is Sepp Blatter when his name was announced at Wembley. I can think of few recipients more worthy.\n\nWhich brings us on to the Education Secretary, Michael Gove. He was spotted at the Olympic archery last week. What a shame the British team didn\u2019t pull him out of the stands at Lord\u2019s and pin him to a target with arrows through his earlobes.\n\nGove decided in October 2010 to axe the \u00a3162m school sports partnership funds that linked a network of local schools and PE teachers. When he was smacked about the court of public opinion, a partial backtrack followed and \u00a365m was restored, but the money is no longer ring-fenced for sport after 2013.\n\nBack to business: The Community shield takes place on Sunday - between Manchester City and Chelsea\n\nWe hear that since the Coalition came to power, 21 school playing fields have also been sold and the Government have announced they will no longer order state schools to provide at least two hours of physical exercise every week.\n\nRemember all this when you see politicians glad-handing medal winners and making vague promises to \u2018build on Olympic success\u2019. They are more likely to build on the penalty area.\n\nThe pre-Games slogan said \u2018Inspire a Generation\u2019 and the signs are it has succeeded. People have witnessed the galvanising effect sport can have at close hand. It might not be on the grand scale of the Olympics, but those smaller, personal triumphs can feel just as important.\n\nIf people tell you money isn\u2019t the answer, point at the cycling team and their expensive technical perfection; point at the rowing team and ask how many of them benefited from the facilities private education offers.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about Government \u2018handouts\u2019, either. Giving people, and children in particular, the best opportunity to play sport at local facilities, or just in an open space somewhere, should be integral to our education system and a compliment to the National Health Service. It\u2019s a central part of what life is about, not some postscript.\n\nFor a time London and Britain was beautiful; it was the best it could be \u2014 and all because of sport. \u2018I\u2019ve got a permanent smile on and my jaw is aching,\u2019 said Jessica Ennis. She\u2019s not the only one. Let\u2019s try and keep it that way.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

warns former Olympic champion", "text": "Our children will be less fit than we are, warns Lord Coe as he calls for more competitive sport in schools after the Olympics\n\nLondon 2012 chairman convinced that Games have lived up to expectations\n\nCalls for sport to be promoted more in schools\n\nThe current generation of parents will probably be the first to be fitter than their children, former Olympic champion Lord Coe has warned.\n\n\n\nThe former Tory MP, who chairs the London 2012 organising committee, called for competitive sport to be promoted more in schools to help combat childhood obesity.\n\n\n\nHe urged politicians to capitalise on the success of the Games and demanded more focus on sport in primary schools.\n\nLegacy: Lord Coe, pictured at the offices of the London 2012 organising committee, has called for more focus on sport in schools after the Olympics\n\n'It is very important that we recognise that has to be underpinned by good quality physical education and by getting people into patterns of exercise,' Lord Coe told the Guardian.\n\n\n\n'We have to recognise that we are probably going to be the first generation of parents that are marginally fitter than our kids.'\n\n\n\nCentral to London's successful bid to host the Olympics was a promise by organisers that the Games would inspire the nation's young people to become more involved in sport.\n\nLord Coe, who won Olympic gold medals in 1980 and 1984, said he was convinced that the Games had lived up to expectations.\n\n\n\nBut he urged politicians not to let a debate over the post-Games legacy to descend into political point scoring.\n\n\n\nWeighty issue: Lord Coe said the current generation of parents was likely to be the first to be fitter than their children\n\nThe shadow Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, has called for a cross-party consensus on the best way to maximise the positive impact of the Olympics.\n\n\n\nShe said: 'We mustn't confuse high quality physical education within schools, and competitive sport. They are, in essence, two different things.\n\n\n\n'Done properly, they take you to the same virtuous outcome. Everybody recognises that giving young people a competitive outlet through sport is a very good thing.'\n\nNext steps: Politicians are keen to capitalise on the success of the Games and encourage families to live more healthily", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

these Games mark a truly historic watershed", "text": "Mo's joyful embrace of Britishness and why these Games mark a truly historic watershed\n\n\n\nMo Farah did it! But actually, he did much more than he knows when he won two gold medals at these Games.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron may have tweeted \u2018Mo Farah is an Olympic legend and a true British hero. We can all be proud of his extraordinary achievement\u2019, but not even the PM quite understands the significance of what has come to pass in these past two weeks.\n\n\n\nFor the fact is the man millions have been leaping off their sofas to cheer over the line was born in Somalia and came to London when he was eight years old. His eldest brother, Faisal, stayed behind, and is now a farmer on a smallholding without electricity. They are close. Two brothers, two lives and a journey that changed everything for one of them.\n\nSomething's changed: Britain's Mo Farah celebrates winning the men's 5000m final with his wife Tania and daughter Rhianna\n\nToday Mo, while remaining a devout Muslim, extols his adopted country.\n\n\n\nWhen he was asked last week after his victory in the 10,000 metres if he\u2019d rather be representing Somalia, his simple response spoke volumes. \u2018Not at all, mate. This is my country.\u2019\n\n\n\nHis joyful embrace of Britishness, replicated by other British Olympians of immigrant stock, has aroused the same rapturous feelings of pride in people who, until now, were wary of nationalistic celebrations and expressions \u2014 including me.\n\n\n\nBut these two weeks have been a watershed of true significance. There has been a visceral reaction among black and Asian Britons to what we have seen. For some, it has been perhaps the first time they have really felt a part of this country. For others, the promise of tolerance and integration has come true.\n\n\n\nSeeing the mixed-race and black competitors fighting fiercely for their personal bests and for their country has been the moment when history turned a page.\n\n\n\nAnd the evidence is not just up there on the medal podiums.\n\n\n\nTen days back, on a London Underground train, I met a Somali family festooned in Union Jack kit. The mum had a red-white-and-blue band across her forehead under a black Muslim head scarf; her sons had on Team GB T-shirts and caps and held Union flags, and on her daughter\u2019s leggings were pictures of crowns, Big Ben and St Paul\u2019s.\n\n\n\nIntegration\n\n\n\nThey were coming back from a halal restaurant after breaking an 18-hour fast for Ramadan, when Muslims can\u2019t eat or drink anything. They told me they were so happy because of Mo Farah\u2019s British victory.\n\n\n\nThey wanted their children to be like him, to make this country proud of them. Near us, a white family was just as joyous and for the same reasons. And I thought: \u2018This is brilliant, we are in it together.\u2019\n\n\n\nOf course I am not labouring under the illusion that this extraordinary festival of goodwill means racism and anti-immigrant hostility have vanished, and that all playing fields are now level. Or that all ghettoised communities are letting the walls fall.\n\n\n\nBut over these Olympic days, even I found it impossible to stay on my soapbox and lament the discrimination and segregation that too often blights this country still.\n\n\n\nJessica Ennis shed a happy tear after her heptathlon victory - and she wasn't alone\n\nWhen half-Jamaican Jessica Ennis, black British boxer Nicola Adams and others of similar heritage claimed their medals, I wept with joy as the National Anthem played. Like millions of other migrants and their children, I threw myself into the warm pool of belonging.\n\n\n\nWe have had such winners before, like the super-driven champions Daley Thompson and Dame Kelly Holmes. But this time, because the Olympics is in London, the whole country has shown its most integrated, optimistic self. Since the July bombings of 2005, the land has too often felt fragmented, mutually suspicious and riven by bigots and Muslim extremists.\n\n\n\nThis Olympics is a turning point \u2014 and it is one with special significance for me personally and my people, the Ugandan Asians. It was 40 years ago this August that Idi Amin announced he was expelling all Asians from the lovely spot in Africa we had helped build over many generations.\n\nBelonging\n\n\n\nThose who had British passports arrived in the UK, many with only \u00a350 in their pockets. It was unbelievably hard for the cast-outs to resettle, to accept that their fortunes had changed and there was no going back.\n\n\n\nIn the early Seventies, Britain was in economic turmoil and the incomers faced overt prejudice. But there were also countless kind Britons who gave the exiles clothes, homes, jobs and loans.\n\nThis group has achieved more success \u2014 and more quickly \u2014 than any other since World War II.\n\n\n\nThey are millionaires, professional high-fliers and among the top in educational tables. What\u2019s more, like my mum, they are true patriots.\n\nA golden promise: Nicola Adams claimed gold in the 51kg boxing category, and a place in the history books\n\nShe said that Britain made her feel safe, independent and truly happy. Whatever my criticisms, I, too, know I would never have become the person I am, or developed so many skills, enjoyed so many rights, got into a profession I love or found my voice, in Uganda.\n\n\n\nThere was no democracy back there, no freedom of speech, no expression of dissent allowed within communities or nationally. It hurts when indigenous Britons attack me for my skin colour or faith, or for presuming to come to live in their country. But that is offset by the love I get from my English husband and white friends.\n\n\n\nLast year, two French footballers of African descent spoke candidly about the difference between their country and Britain, the nation where they now both play for Tottenham.\n\n\n\nBenoit Assou-Ekotto explained why England felt to him more open than France: \u2018Here in Britain it is different. People might say that their parents are from the Ivory Coast or Nigeria or whatever, but they are fiercely proud of being here and the society accepts that.\n\n\n\n\u2018France has been unwilling or unable to accommodate the sons and daughters from its former colonies.\u2019\n\n\n\nOpen-minded\n\n\n\nBenoit\u2019s team-mate, Sebastien Bassong, agreed, and passionately. \u2018It\u2019s just a fact,\u2019 he said. \u2018In Britain it is more open and that\u2019s why people come here. They know they will get a chance no matter how they dress or where they\u2019re from. Here, minds are more open.\u2019\n\n\n\nIt was that national sense of open-mindedness that allowed people like Mo Farah to come to this country \u2014 and, in return, it is the reason he has been so proud to embrace the flag and the culture and give back.\n\n\n\nThere has been much talk about the post-Olympic legacy, about getting the young into sports and the health benefits of doing that. But just as important is the legacy of Britain\u2019s winning inclusivity.\n\nThe Games showed this country\u2019s diverse identity in its very best light, made and re-made by natives and strangers through sheer determination.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26157344-0-image-a-11_1584611009461.jpg",

Share this article Share Great Britain's athletes achieved their greatest medal haul in over hundred years. But London 2012 is about much more than just sport. It's about the 70,000 volunteers who slipped into their purple outfits, every day without fail, to help the Games run smoothly. It's about the 1,000 plus troops who were drafted in at the last minute to help bolster security in the wake of the G4S fiasco - but did their duty without complaint.\n\nAnd it's about the Britons who filled stadiums and venues, and lined the streets for every race, whatever the weather, wrapped in union flags and shouted themselves hoarse - roaring on athletes from every nation. Britain and London took the Olympics to its heart and has worn the rings with pride.\n\n\n\nDawn: Sunrise over the River Thames on the final day of the London 2012 Olympics\n\nRings: The Olympic flag flutters in front of the soon-to-be-named Elizabeth Tower as the final day of competition begins\n\nLondon at large: Equestrian events at Greenwich Park were set against the backdrop of the famous observatory and Canary Wharf\n\nFew cities in the world boast the kind of landmarks London has in spades. And the organisers did their best to show of the best of London - cleverly staging events so they showcased the capital's spectacular highlights. Visitors were given a healthy dose of the city's royal heritage; from the the beach volleyball, which took place in a purpose-built stadium in the shadow of Buckingham Palace; to the rowing events at Eton Dorney, overlooked by Windsor Castle. The equestrian centre at Greenwich Park gave guests a taste of London old and new, surrounded by the Naval College and Royal Observatory, and behind it the skyline of Canary Wharf. And on the final day, the men's marathon snaked around the city's ancient streets, finishing up on the mall. In case anyone has forgotten why they fell in love with London this past fortnight, tonight's closing ceremony will showcase scale models of the city's most famous landmarks in a top secret sequence .

(Photo by Oli Scarff/Getty Images) The Queen today congratulated the athletes of Great Britain and the Commonwealth, saying their efforts had 'captured the public's imagination and earned their admiration'. As London 2012 draws to a close, the Queen said Team GB's success - the best performance in more than a century - would inspire a new generation of Olympians and remind everyone how sport 'unifies communities and nations'. The Queen herself played a starring role in the opening ceremony for the Games, featuring in pre-recorded film scenes with Daniel Craig starring as James Bond, before appearing to parachute from a helicopter into the stadium. More than two weeks on, following an Olympics heralded by many as the most successful Games ever, she sent a special message to Team GB, organisers and volunteers, as well as passing messages to the Commonwealth commending their performances in London 2012. 'As the 2012 London Olympic Games come to a close, I offer my congratulations to the athletes of Great Britain and the Commonwealth, whose efforts across the range of Olympic disciplines have truly captured the public's imagination and earned their admiration,' the Queen said. 'The outstanding performance of Team GB, in achieving the greatest Olympic success since 1908, will, I am sure, have inspired a new generation of Olympians and reminded us all how sport unifies communities and nations. 'I congratulate, too, the organisers of the Games, as well as the thousands of volunteers who have epitomised the Olympic spirit through the warm welcome they have shown to the sporting teams and spectators from all around the world. 'As a nation, we now look forward to the Paralympic Games and wish all athletes every success.'\n\nWiggins rides: The Olympics ventured to the outer reaches of London for the road cycling events, based in the grandeur of Hampton Court Palace\n\nHorse Guards Parade: Organisers somehow managed to sandwich a huge 11,000 seat beach volleyball stadium into the packed streets around Westminster and the royal palaces Best seat in the house: Visitors on the London Eye overlook the temporary beach volleyball stadium in Horse Guards Parade Prime Minister David Cameron insists Britain should be proud of the way London hosted the Olympics and its athletes dominated competition.\n\nHe said : 'We showed the world what we're made of, we reminded ourselves of what we could do and, yes, we demonstrated that you should never ever count Team GB down and out. Cameron's comments carried undertones of vindication after a slew of negative coverage in the months leading up to the Games by British media, who criticised the event's 9 billion pound ($14 billion) cost and shortcomings in planning and security.\n\nLondon 2012 chief Sebastian Coe, flanking Cameron at the news conference, used his appearance to highlight the importance of an Olympic legacy.\n\n'Our collective challenge now is to make sure that we leverage every ounce of the golden opportunity that is in front of us, whether it's economic, whether it's social or whether it's sporting,' Coe said.\n\nCameron appointed Coe as Britain's Olympics legacy ambassador and assured British athletes that government and National Lottery cash would continue to fund their training programmes through to the 2016 Rio Olympics. US President Barack Obama even telephoned David Cameron to offer his congratulations for a 'brilliant' London Olympics, Downing Street said. A Number 10 spokesman said: 'The President praised the organisation of the Games and the amazing performance of Team GB athletes. 'And he thanked the Prime Minister for the hospitality the UK had shown to the First Lady at the start of the Games and the US team ever since.' Mr Cameron in turn offered the UK's congratulations on the US team's 'astounding' medals table-topping performance and said Britain had 'thoroughly enjoyed' hosting its athletes.\n\n\n\nWrite caption here\n\n\n\nGold medal: A full moon on August 3 is captured within the Olympic rings hanging from Tower Bridge\n\nWhatever weather: The rain fell on August 5 as female marathon runners negotiated their way around the city's streets, but spectators still lined the course in their thousands\n\n\n\n\n\nLeafy London: Olympic rowing events drew sports fans out to Eton Dorney, overlooked by nearby Windsor Castle Every Olympics fan will have a favourite moment of London 2012. It could be Mo Farah's achievements on the track, Tom Daley's joy at winning a diving bronze, or the astounding success of teen swimmers Ye Shiwen and Ruta Meilutyt. For IOC president Jacques Rogge, it's Sir Chris Hoy's tears after he won his second gold of the Games, making him Britain's greatest ever Olympian. Speaking ahead of tonight's Closing Ceremony Rogge said: 'There are so many things, I have not one favourite moment,\" Rogge said when asked at a news conference what it might be. 'If I would have to take one, not emotion, but a sentimental one, that would be the tears of Chris Hoy. I think that's one of the defining moments of the Games.' Hoy wept after clinching his sixth Olympic cycling gold medal, in the keirin, last Tuesday, ensuring Britain matched their Beijing record of seven track titles. Rogge said many athletes had managed to write Olympic history in London, including American swimmer Michael Phelps, who became the most decorated Olympian, and Britain's Ben Ainslie, who became the most successful Games sailor. He also picked out Italian fencer Valentina Vezzali for racking up a sixth gold and Andy Murray for winning his first big tennis title. 'I could go on for the rest of the Games but the marathon finishes in two hours so therefore I will shorten my speech,' he said.

And the mayor of the Brazilian city admits he faces a battle to better London 2012, which he called the 'greatest Games ever'.\n\nAt a joint press conference with Boris Johnson in central London, Eduardo Paes said: 'As we predicted you just did the greatest Games ever.'\n\n'I really want to congratulate Mayor Boris Johnson for leading the city of London into these great Games.\n\n'These are Games of legacy, I've been to London many times and it's amazing what you did in the area of the Olympic park.\n\n'The logistics of the operation, the mobility of the people in London is really something.\n\n'We came here for a little advice from Mayor Boris and we're going to use the lessons we learned here in London for Rio's Games.\n\n'The city of Rio, it's not as rich as yours, but we're in good shape now.'\n\nHe said the London 2012 team had done a \"great job\" and they had 'learned a lot' from London.\n\nThe Olympics were not something that just took place for the two or three weeks the Games are on, 'but happens before and after'.\n\nHe added: 'Everyone's looking at London, this was already a great city and it became even a greater city so Rio will try to follow you.

From Danny Boyle\u2019s magical opening ceremony, celebrating our history with more than a touch of humour, to tonight\u2019s climax, we have been excited and inspired by the world\u2019s greatest sportsmen and women.\n\nThe biggest surprise of the Olympics has been the rediscovery of a shared sense of national pride. It is as if, liberated from our traditional scepticism and self deprecation, we are rather enjoying being British. Team GB has done us proud.\n\n\n\nAnd, as we hand over the baton to Rio 2016, Lord Coe and his team should be congratulated on having staged one of the most successful Olympic Games in modern times.\n\n\n\nIn the venues around London and elsewhere, outstanding sporting moments were shared with visitors from all over the world in a spirit of joy and celebration of achievement.\n\nI saw this for myself last Wednesday after winning the chance in the ballot to buy tickets for the main arena. It really did match the Olympic creed that the \u2018most important thing is not to win but to take part\u2019.\n\n\n\nAre there lessons from the success of the Games for the British economy? I\u2019d take three from the experience of the past fortnight.\n\nFirst, and most important, we have been reminded that an objective that is worth attaining, like a gold medal, requires years of hard work. Success does not come overnight. That is as true of our economy as it is of sport.\n\n\n\nThe success of our economy in the years ahead depends on the foundations we lay today. That means focusing on improving education and skills so that we are equipped to face the challenges from competitors around the world. And it means reforming our banking system so that banks focus less on making money in the short term, and more on building businesses to serve their customers\u2019 interests over the longer term.\n\nYes, for many years, our financial sector sustained the illusion that it was possible to become a millionaire overnight by buying and selling pieces of paper. But we have seen how paper fortunes in financial markets can disappear overnight. Things need to change. The Government\u2019s plans to build a wall between banks\u2019 risky trading on one side, and their lending to businesses and families on the other, will help. As will the injection of new competition into our banking system. And, as recent scandals have shown, banks could learn a thing or two about fair play from the Olympic movement.\n\nHard work: Tom Daley's dedication should teach bankers to think about the long term, and not the short The second lesson is that motivation does not come from financial incentives alone. Again, the financial sector has done us all a disservice in promoting the belief that massive financial compensation is necessary to motivate individuals. Look at the success of the volunteers whose presence at the Olympic Park and around London did so much to create the atmosphere of happiness that pervaded the Games, and who represented all of us so well when greeting and helping the many visitors from overseas. Motivation is more than mere money. Over the years, the people who have impressed me most in business have been those motivated primarily by the desire to show that their products are the best. By being passionate about what they produce, and the customers whom they serve, they achieve success, and, in so doing, they make money, almost as a by-product. There is no substitute for passion and commitment to one\u2019s sport or business. The final lesson from the Olympics is that competitive team sports \u2013 and all the athletes in London belong to a team \u2013 are an essential part of children\u2019s education. Learning to play in a team, the importance of trusting others in order to find success, how to cope with victory and defeat, are all preparation for the world of work. Building on initiatives such as Chance to Shine \u2013 which has brought competitive cricket to more than one-and-a-half-million boys and girls in state schools \u2013 and the Wimbledon Junior Tennis Initiative, we need to help schools restore competitive sports to their place in a rounded education. We must invest in the next generation so that they not only win gold medals in sport but in their working lives, too.\n\nLessons for success: Victoria Pendleton's tenacity and hard work should be a role model for British business\n\nThe Games have shown that sport can generate an atmosphere of trust and understanding. In the midst of the most difficult economic times for several generations, the need for countries to trust each other and work together is more important than ever. The origins of the financial crisis were global. So too must be its solution.\n\nAs the warm glow fades, what remains? Most visibly, a huge part of East London has been regenerated, transforming the area for good. But the organisers also set out to \u2018inspire a generation\u2019. I am sure they have succeeded. And, of course, we are left with a legacy of magnificent venues in which young athletes, inspired by these Games, can set out to fulfil their dreams.\n\nBy spreading happiness and good cheer the Games have made us all feel better. And, who knows, the impact on confidence may give the economy a boost. But ultimately the Games cannot alter the underlying economic situation we face. If the rest of the world were growing normally, the rebalancing and recovery of our economy would be much easier. But it isn\u2019t. Even the rapidly expanding emerging market economies are slowing, and the problems of the euro area continue with no obvious end in sight.\n\nBankers should concentrate on laying a solid foundation for customers, not focusing on making quick cash\n\n\n\nAt home, unlike the Olympians who have thrilled us, our economy is not at full fitness right now. But it is slowly healing. The conditions are in place for a recovery, and the Bank of England is, and will carry on, doing all we can to help bring it about. Interest rates are low. Inflation has fallen. We have injected money to stimulate the economy. The squeeze on real take-home pay is coming to an end. And the Funding for Lending Scheme, launched just over a week ago, will help families and businesses who need a mortgage or a loan to get one. But if we have learnt anything from the past fortnight, it is that commitment and hard work over a long period are necessary for eventual success.", "images":

today", "text": "Tax breaks for sports clubs can make the first Olympic legacy a fitter, healthier Britain\n\nThe athletes are leaving. The flags have been taken down. The Olympics have finished with a flourish and the British people can rightly look bad with immense pride on a superbly orchestrated Games.\n\n\n\nThere is much talk of an Olympic legacy. The government has said that it will continue to fund elite athletes for Rio 2016. The Prime Minister has also announced that primary schools will be required to focus on team sport. So far, so predictable.\n\n\n\nBut we cannot risk making the same mistakes as Australia. After Sydney 2000, 12 years on Australia's Olympians did poorly. And Australia is an outdoor, sporting nation.\n\nPhoenix from the flames: As the Olympic flame died, it was replaced by a Phoenix which rose above the stadium but what will be the longer lasting impact of England hosting the flame?\n\nDespite the optimism, happiness and glory of the past fortnight we cannot get away from the fact that Britons are self-deprecating, slothful and often pessimistic. If we wait too long, I fear that we will fail to capitalise on the stunning success of London 2012.\n\n\n\nOur economy needs to capitalise on the wave of positivity from the Olympics. Will the Mo Farah and Jess Ennis-inspired feel-good factor really generate economic growth at last? I doubt it because taxes, regulations and barriers to investment, risk taking and job creation remain too high).\n\n\n\nThe wonderful Mayor of London (who, if Prime Minister, would definitely know how to capitalise on the past fortnight for our nation's benefit) has called for us to roll out some grand infrastructure projects. That's all well and good but they will take years to come on stream.\n\nGolden victory: Great Britain's Mo Farah is one of many athletes who has inspired the younger generations to take up sports - but this shouldn't be the only legacy of the games\n\nIf we want an immediate legacy from the Olympics then it should be in the fields of health, nutrition and sport - and not just for the young. For in addition to ensuring money is available for sports coaching for kids (principally because teaching unions are refusing to encourage their members to coach kids themselves), the Government should take immediate positive steps to encourage adults to become more active.\n\n\n\nIf memberships of gyms and sports clubs, personal training sessions and personal health expenditure were all tax deductible then I expect that we would see an explosion of activity among those who most need to become active. We need a fitter Britain, with people pre-empting problems rather than having them dealt with by the NHS when they fall ill through obesity-related conditions.\n\n", "images":

The flags have been taken down. The Olympics have finished with a flourish and the British people can rightly look bad with immense pride on a superbly orchestrated Games.\n\nThere is much talk of an Olympic legacy. The government has said that it will continue to fund elite athletes for Rio 2016. The Prime Minister has also announced that primary schools will be required to focus on team sport. So far, so predictable.\n\nBut we cannot risk making the same mistakes as Australia. After Sydney 2000, 12 years on Australia's Olympians did poorly. And Australia is an outdoor, sporting nation.\n\nDespite the optimism, happiness and glory of the past fornight we cannot get away from the fact that Britons are self-deprecating, slothful and often pessimistic. If we wait too long, I fear that we will fail to capitalise on the stunning success of London 2012.\n\nOur economy needs to capitalise on the wave of positivity from the Olympics. Will the Mo Farah and Jess Ennis-inspired feel-good factor really generate economic growth at last? I doubt it because taxes, regulations and barriers to investment, risk taking and job creation remain too high).\n\nThe wonderful Mayor of London (who, if Prime Minister, would definitely know how to capitalise on the past fortnight for our nation's benefit) has called for us to roll out some grand infrastructure projects. That's all well and good but they will take years to come on stream.\n\nIf we want an immediate legacy from the Olympics then it should be in the fields of health, nutrition and sport - and not just for the young. For in addition to ensuring money is available for sports coaching for kids (principally because teaching unions are refusing to encourage their members to coach kids themselves), the government should take immediate positive steps to encourage adults to become more active.\n\nIf memberships of gyms and sports clubs, personal training sessions and personal health expenditure were all tax deductible then I expect that we would see an explosion of activity among those who most need to become active. We need a fitter Britain, with people pre-empting problems rather than having them dealt with by the NHS when they fall ill through obesity-related conditions.\n\nThis is a change that could be announced today by the Chancellor. It would show that the government is serious about creating an immediate Olympic legacy.", "images": ["https://anmblog.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c565553ef01a5117270c0970c-pi", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/blogs/blaney_rss.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=14366613&name=blog.blaneyblog.page&mo_vs_pl=we&mo_vs_pr=dm&mo_vs_ct=bl&mo_tb=0&category=home&mo_site=dailymail&mo_logged_in=0", "http://anm.intelli-direct.com/e/t3.dll?230&0&%20&iAddPAR&iREGQry&iSale&0&0&0&0&0&0&%20&1500&%20&0", "https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png"], "top_image": "https://anmblog.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341c565553ef01a5117270c0970c-pi", "date": "13/08/2012"}, "rank_16": {"title": "Olympics 2012: What we can take away from the London Games...", "text": "Our revels now are ended: So what can Britain take away from the London Olympics?\n\nAnd so, to quote (somewhat fittingly) Shakespeare, our revels now are ended. And with them, two weeks of glorious, feel-good bonhomie, joyful exaltation, unbridled merriment and intoxicating upliftment, the likes of which I cannot remember ever feeling before in London.\n\n\n\nWill the nation now breathe a collective sigh, exhausted and emotionally drained from the mass euphoria which has overcome us since the opening ceremony, or will we shed a poignant tear, sad that this successful celebration of British athletic achievement, and with it Britain and Britishness, has come to an end? The latter, I think - and for good reason.\n\nLondon 2012 has been a triumph, a gargantuan victory over everyone and everything. Team GB has beaten not only the other world class athletes on the track, field, water, velodrome or arena, but also the political nay-sayers, the portentous cloud left by last summer\u2019s riots, and the habitually offensive buffoonery of overpaid and under-performing Premier League footballers, which all served as the backdrop to these games.\n\nThe Olympic legacy for Britain is one of increased unity, belonging and pride in our country for all who live here and for all who call it home\n\nLast night at the closing ceremony a somewhat quirky medley of British music, from the Spice Girls to George Michael and Eric Idol, brought the curtain down on the London 2012 oneiric idyll, and with it came Lord Coe\u2019s laconic but fitting words, \u201cwe did it right\u201d \u2013 delivered in that quintessentially British, restrained way.\n\n\n\nThe tally of 29 British gold medals certainly defied all expectation, and marks a rarity for our country, which so often fails to deliver at the highest level that we as Brits are accustomed to feeling let down on the big sporting occasions.\n\nBut beyond memorable sporting triumphs, what have the London Olympics bequeathed to us? What will their social ramifications be in years to come? How will they endure in the popular consciousness?\n\n\n\nI for one think they have bequeathed several great and meaningful things at a very opportune moment. I certainly hope these games will have a resoundingly positive effect on the social, cultural and racial fabric of this nation and its values.\n\nWorld's best: Helen Glover and Heather Stanning stand proudly with their gold medals after winning the women's pair final at Eton Dorney\n\nFor me, the swathes of Union Jack flags, worn proudly by black, brown and white Brits together, have been a delight to behold. This harmless but stirring sense of patriotism, uniting formerly disparate communities behind Team GB, has been utterly beautiful, intensely moving and thoroughly enchanting.\n\n\n\nNaturally, the sight of Mo Farah draped in the Union Jack after his two victories, a symbolic gesture telling of an ardent desire to integrate both as an immigrant and as a Muslim, was majestic, deeply poignant and hopefully far-reaching in its potency. If anything, such is the stuff of which dreams (not to mention increased social cohesion and with it prosperity for all Britons) are made.\n\n\n\nIf we are honest, Britain\u2019s fast-fading grandeur and rapidly diminishing place on the world stage \u2013 now almost belonging to a bygone era, when men wore bowler hats and everyone on the BBC spoke in R.P. \u2013 has been reclaimed, if not reversed, over the past two weeks. We can never deny that Britain has changed, in many ways for the worse, but maybe, just maybe, these games have given us a tangible sense of hope for better things yet to come.\n\n\n\nInspirational: Mo Farah powered ahead of the field in the closing stages of the 10,000m\n\nA sense of the possible, a sense of not just what we once were, but of who we can still be, and who we will be in the future. A sense of where we can go as a nation is what I will take from London 2012. And maybe, on the evidence of the last two weeks, there is still lots to extol and acclaim. In short, there is still an awful lot of greatness here.\n\n\n\nMo Farah, Jennica Ennis and Nicola Adams \u2013 poster-men and women for a Britain of many hues and as a land of opportunity for all, were truly heroic, both in deed and stature.\n\n\n\nSo too were Sir Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins, Tom Daley, Greg Rutherford and countless others. I know that many black or mixed-race British athletes, such as Daley Thompson, Kelly Holmes and Linford Christie (to name only a few) were Olympic gold medalists in previous games, but it definitely felt that at London 2012 for the first time on home soil, both the country and the athletes felt genuinely at ease with our gloriously multi-racial background. There were no awkward contradictions, or moments of uncomfortable allegiance.\n\n\n\nEveryone felt at ease in their skin. For me, as a mixed-race Brit, this can only augur well, as it points to an increased racial maturity in our island consciousness. Hopefully this can serve as a watershed moment in the development of a Britain of many colours, which can lead to better race relations and to more unity, more integration and a less fragmented, less apologetic sense of Britishness.\n\nChampion: Wiggins, posing with his gold after the time trial, briefly became Britain's most decorated Olympian - until Chris Hoy's Olympics started\n\nWhat about the moral virtues that sport can impart? For me, London 2012 has highlighted one virtue beyond all others: humility. Humility and great sporting prowess are, sad to say, rare bedfellows. In fact, there is often a strong positive correlation between remarkable achievement on the track or field and obnoxious egos and galling hubris off it.\n\nAnd yet the London 2012 Olympics threw up countless beautiful examples of true greatness and true magnanimity of spirit coupled with true humility. I will long remember Mo Farah being interviewed after his 5000m triumph as an example of letting the actions speak for themselves and remaining utterly grounded, down to earth and peerlessly humble, even when he had just conquered the world.\n\n\n\nMany will also remember London 2012 for the almost superhuman athletic pyrotechnics of Usain Bolt, feats which were beyond exceptional. But so too was the humility with which he and his fellow Jamaicans, especially Yohan Blake, celebrated their astonishing record-breaking triumphs of speed. Such humility is deeply humbling and, coming in an event more used to imperious American brashness, braggadocio and swagger, was very welcome.\n\n\n\nBolt too deserves singular praise. With his comic gestures (performing press-ups after winning the 200m gold medal, or doing the Mobot out of deference to Mo Farah\u2019s 5000m victory), Bolt is not just a consummate showman, but an athlete so effortlessly at ease with his own sporting superiority that, like Muhammed Ali, Pele or Michael Jordan before him, he can just relax and show the world what a nice guy he is.\n\n\n\nFor me, Bolt\u2019s gesture in talking to the young track attendant in charge of carrying his kit before the 200m final, and in so-doing putting her at ease before arguably the biggest race of his life, speaks volumes about the man, his personality and his moral fibre.\n\n\n\nLikewise, another stand-out facet of these Olympics for me has been the unstinting devotion of the volunteers, who gave so readily of their time, smiles and goodwill to ensure the logistical aspect of the games passed smoothly. They were all perfect ambassadors of Britishness to the world \u2013 dedicated, friendly, cheerful, kind and exceedingly helpful. I was amazed, when attending events at the Olympic Park, at just how courteous and affable they all were - even in the midst of demanding crowds.\n\n\n\nTheir enthusiasm was beyond infectious. They truly did our city and our nation proud. The old adage \u201cGiving is the rent we pay for living\u201d could not have been more perfectly expressed in their warm demeanours and positive outlooks. Their selflessness deeply moved me, as did that of the Armed Forces personnel who came to the rescue of G4S, many cancelling leave after serving in Afghanistan to man the breach. They were examples to us all of what it means not to let the side, or the country, down in an hour of need.\n\n\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson emerged (rather unsurprisingly) as another Olympian victor, with the usual incredibly effective mixture of self-deprecating charm, self-lacerating humour and self-effacing posturing of which he is master captivating the hearts of both Londoners and those further afield. It remains to be seen what Johnson will do with his increased popularity, but Cameron probably has every reason to rue his heir-apparent\u2019s Olympic success.\n\n\n\nLondon too deserves applause. Despite the fact that London airports are today expecting the busiest period in their history, I am sure that, on the evidence of the last two weeks, the city will cope just fine. When so much had been said prior to the games of the transport calamities we faced, everything went far better than expected. The city and the tube stood up to the task and proved themselves more than capable.\n\nWonderful: The Olympics enthralled many for 16 days and threw up countless beautiful examples of true greatness\n\nOne can only hope that, beyond inspiring us to even greater sporting achievements, or getting more of us up off our couches and into healthier lifestyles, the Olympic legacy for Britain is one of increased unity, belonging and pride in our country for all who live here and for all who call it home.\n\n\n\nHowever foolishly naive and utopian that may sound, a shared, wholly integrated culture where all colours, ethnicities and backgrounds are proud to contribute to the fabric and well-being of our country must be the aim.\n\n\n\nFor all its many faults and imperfections, Britain is still a great country and remains a great place to live. Although my nationality is an accident of birth over which I had no control, these Olympics made me inordinately proud to be British.\n\n\n\nAs someone who was rapidly falling out of love with London prior to the last two weeks, these games have also served as a timely reminder, both to me and to the world, of the city\u2019s ineffable greatness. London caput mundi is a phrase which we have not heard for decades, if not centuries, but still nonetheless has a very pleasing ring to it. May it be a harbinger of renewed intellectual, cultural and creative vigour and further civic pride in the capital.\n\n\n\nHowever short-lived the incredible feeling of Olympic-engendered happiness proves to be, however swiftly we return to impending fiscal doom and economic woe, the London Olympics have done more good for the happiness quotient of this nation than a year\u2019s worth of prozac and political sound-bites put together could ever do.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26157344-0-image-a-11_1584611009461.jpg",

Olympics.\n\nEducation Secretary Michael Gove has scrapped regulations which dictate how much space schools should provide for their pupils for team games.\n\nNew rules state merely that \u2018suitable\u2019 outdoor space must be provided for sport and play.\n\nThing of the past? Schools will no longer be required to maintain a specific amount of space on their playing fields for team sports under rules brought in on the eve of the Olympics\n\nThe move calls into question the Coalition\u2019s strategy on school sport and building a lasting Olympic legacy which boosts competitive games.\n\nCritics warned that more playing fields could now be sold off, undermining the Coalition\u2019s commitment to strengthening competitive sport.\n\nDavid Cameron recently pledged to put sports such as netball, tennis and football on the national curriculum for primary school children and said the ethos of schools must change so pupils learn that \u2018winning and losing is an important part of growing up\u2019.\n\nThe new rules on school playing fields were drawn up on July 19, laid before Parliament on July 30 and come into force in October.\n\nUnder current regulations, dating from 1999, schools are expected to follow detailed rules on outdoor space laid down in a table which is enshrined in law.\n\nPrimary schools with fewer than 200 pupils, for example, should set aside 30 square yards or 25 square metres of \u2018game playing field\u2019 for every child.\n\nUp and running: London 2012 chariman Lord Coe and Prime Minister David Cameron have praised the success of the Olympics and pledge to build a lasting legacy which boosts competitive sport\n\nLarger primaries must set aside 50 square yards, or 42 square metres. Secondary schools must set aside up to 60 square yards, or 50 square metres, depending on its size.\n\nBut a recent Government consultation found many state schools were struggling to meet the requirements and suggested they be modified.\n\nSchool sport has proved a tricky issue for the Coalition during the Olympics after it emerged that it has scrapped a target for schools to provide two hours of PE a week.\n\nIt also emerged that Mr Gove has sanctioned the disposal of 22 playing fields, although most were at schools that had closed or were merging.\n\nThe Department for Education said it would soon consult on a new minimum requirement for playing field space, which would be simpler than the current \u2018bureaucratic\u2019 table of ratios. This would be non-binding guidance.\n\nContradictions: Despite a pledge by Mr Cameron to put team sports on the national curriculum, Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured) has scrapped regulations which dictate how much playing field space schools need to provide\n\nOfficials insisted the new policy states for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal PE lessons and for outdoor play, rather than simply team sport.\n\nBut Alison Moore-Gwyn, of the charity Fields In Trust, warned that playing fields could be cut back and called for a \u2018firm commitment from the Government to prioritise school sport and facilities\u2019.\n\nTim Lamb, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, an umbrella organisation for sports bodies, said the old regulations had been a \u2018key tool\u2019 in preventing playing fields being sold.\n\n\u2018Without a minimum requirement, the danger is that short-term expediency could jeopardise the ability of schools to deliver sport for future generations,\u2019 he said.\n\nLabour education spokesman Stephen Twigg said: \u2018This just shows how out of touch Michael Gove is.\n\n\n\n'Not satisfied with getting rid of the target of pupils playing two hours of sport a week, he is now weakening the standards Labour introduced to protect school playing fields.\n\n\n\n\u2018If we are to ensure the Olympic legacy, the Government must ensure that schools provide a decent amount of space for competitive sports and play.\u2019\n\nA spokesman for the Department for Education said: \u2018These regulations set out for the first time that all schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for both formal PE lessons and for outdoor play.\n\n\u2018By removing pages and pages of bureaucratic restrictions we will make it easier and cheaper to provide the badly needed extra school places that this country needs so urgently.",

playing fields introduced days before Olympics", "text": "Backlash grows over plans to cut back on school playing fields introduced days before Olympics\n\n\n\nCharities say change could make it easier for schools to cut back playing fields\n\nMinisters warn against 'salami slicing' of playing fields\n\nWarning: School fields face cuts\n\nMinisters were facing a growing backlash last night over the scrapping of rules which set out the minimum space schools must provide for team sports.\n\nCharities said the change \u2013 brought in on the eve of the Olympics \u2013 made it easier for schools to justify cutting back the size of their playing fields.\n\nThe warning came as Labour said it would call a Commons vote to demand a U-turn on the axing of the regulations, which specify the amount of \u2018team game playing fields\u2019 schools must provide.\n\nShadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the move could lead to \u2018salami slicing\u2019 of school pitches.\n\nIt also emerged that more than half of respondents to a consultation on the proposed change were opposed to it.\n\nBut the Department for Education said the rule change was needed to allow more school places to be created quickly and cheaply to accommodate a surge in the birth rate.\n\nCouncils and schools will be able to ask the Education Secretary to build extra permanent or mobile classrooms on playing fields to meet growing need for places. Under rules which are still in force, schools must provide between 2,500 and 75,000 square metres of space for team games depending on the number of pupils.\n\nThe new rules, laid before Parliament last month and coming into effect in October, merely say schools must provide \u2018suitable outdoor space\u2019 for physical education and play.\n\nThe detailed table of minimum space requirements will be rewritten and simplified later in the Parliament but will be laid down in non-binding guidance rather than law. Don Earley, deputy chief executive of the charity Fields in Trust, said: \u2018Clearly the effect of having these tables in guidance rather than legislation is more flexibility for schools to look to dispose of part of a playing field.\n\nShadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the waning could lead to 'salami slicing' of school pitches\n\n\u2018Why on earth would we want to move the table from rules and regulations and into guidance? Clearly the rules will not be as strong. We are looking for a stronger lead from the Department for Education.\u2019\n\nMr Twigg said Labour would table a motion when Parliament returns next month to allow MPs to debate the changes. \u2018It\u2019s not too late for the Government to change its mind,\u2019 he said. \u2018We need to ensure there is no salami slicing of school playing fields.\u2019\n\nA summary of responses to a consultation on the changes revealed that 52 per cent of respondents disagreed with it, with only 35 per cent agreeing.\n\nSome local authorities warned that \u2018developers would deliver the minimum standard possible\u2019 and \u2018without specific spaces set out in regulation a valuable lever would be lost\u2019.\n\n\n\n'It\u2019s not too late for the Government to change its mind. We need to ensure there is no salami slicing of school playing fields.'\n\n\n\nThe disclosures put the Coalition under growing pressure over its strategy for creating an Olympic legacy through schools. It has already faced criticism for scrapping a scheme aimed at building links between schools and clubs and reducing the amount of ring-fenced cash for school sport.\n\nOfficials at the Department for Education said \u2018extremely strict\u2019 rules which controlled the sale of playing fields remained in place.\n\n\u2018We will only agree to the sale of school playing fields if the sports and curriculum needs of schools and neighbouring ones can still be met,\u2019 a spokesman said.\n\n\u2018All schools must have access to suitable outdoor space for formal PE lessons and for outdoor play.\n\n\u2018By removing pages and pages of bureaucratic restrictions we will make it easier and cheaper to provide the extra school places that this country needs so urgently.\u2019\n\nAt present, schools can be granted a formal \u2018relaxation\u2019 if they cannot provide enough outdoor space to fulfil the regulations.\n\nSome, especially in the inner-cities, do not have the requisite space on site and must bus pupils to parks or community grounds or use indoor areas.\n\nThe minimum requirement tables are also used to assess the suitability of proposals to sell off playing fields. Without them, it could become easier to justify disposing of land, it is claimed.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/16/article-0-148F5789000005DC-732_233x423.jpg",

Don\u2019t be a twit, Jezza\n\nTargeted: Jeremy Clarkson has revealed that he was sent abusive tweets after he announced his ancient labrador, Whoopi, had died\n\nWhen Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s beloved Labrador Whoopi passed away, he announced it on Twitter. \u2018A few moments ago my dog died,\u2019 he tweeted.\n\nFrom his 503,861 followers he expected sympathy. Instead internet trolls joked about the demise of the family\u2019s 15-year-old pet.\n\nOne simply said: \u2018Good\u2019. Another asked: \u2018How does she smell?\u2019\n\nClarkson was understandably appalled. His response was to accuse Britain of being a nation of \u201862million complete and utter b*****ds\u2019.\n\nClarkson divides the world like Marmite. I happen to like him very much. And although the \u2018series-record\u2019 option for Top Gear on my Sky box \u2014 which automatically recorded every programme \u2014 was the first thing I deleted when I broke up with my long-term partner, that was more about ridding my world of my ex than of the talented, lovable Clarkson.\n\nAnyone who has ever regarded a dog or a cat as part of the family, as most pet owners do, can imagine his distress.\n\nBut hold on a moment. While it goes without saying that the behaviour of these internet trolls is as despicable as it is offensive, hasn\u2019t Clarkson brought their abuse on himself? Celebrities like him use Twitter because they benefit massively from the constant, 24/7 exposure it brings them.\n\nYet they are playing with fire. However many loyal fans a celebrity has on Twitter, it has become the underground playground for twisted inadequates who revel in others\u2019 misfortune.\n\nFollowing the death of Whoopi (pictured) one online troll asked Clarkson 'how does she smell?'\n\nBe it Stephen Fry or Rebecca Adlington, no one is spared their malign attacks.\n\nTwitter allows trolls, under the cloak of assumed identities, to make comments that they would not dare say even to their worst enemy in the pub. Comments that can be fired off in seconds without thought, decency or shame.\n\nAnd as soon as one troll attacks, others pile in, validated and encouraged in their bravado by each other\u2019s odious spite. The language of hatred becomes a badge of honour for these subterranean internet-obsessed losers.\n\nClarkson does not need Twitter to promote himself. He is the BBC\u2019s highest earner, taking home an estimated \u00a33 million a year from Top Gear, on top of income from his best-selling books. He has around 350 million viewers a week in 170 different countries.\n\nOf course, I feel sympathy for him losing Whoopi and for the horrible cyber attack he\u2019s endured. But when he responds by saying all of us in Britain are utter b*****ds, that sympathy quickly diminishes.\n\nThe truth is that this country is mostly full of decent people, and we British are among the greatest animal lovers in the world.\n\nRather than condemning all of us in his unconsidered response, Clarkson should stop playing into the hands of a few vile weirdos \u2014 and immediately close his Twitter account.\n\nIt\u2019s back tonight and the X Factor\u2019s Louis Walsh says he\u2019s hoping to appear in a tenth series after this one, attacking fellow judge Tulisa as a \u2018chav in a tracksuit\u2019 for good measure.\n\nLouis vows he won\u2019t be like Bruce Forsyth, saying he\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time to quit. True, he\u2019ll never be like Brucie \u2014 a man who is loved, talented and a true gentleman.\n\nKatrina Darling, Kate Middleton's cousin stars in Playboy's 'Britain's New Burlesque Queen' spread\n\nPippa sets the bottom line . . .\n\nMuch harrumphing as the cousin of Kate Middleton strips for Playboy for a six-figure sum. So what if Katrina Darling disports a fabulous derriere for profit? Why should sister Pippa be the only one making a fortune on the back of her bottom.\n\nTears for tragic Tony\n\nNo one could have failed to be moved by Tony Nicklinson\u2019s anguished tears after he heard he\u2019d lost his legal battle for the right to end his life, with a doctor\u2019s assistance, when he chooses.\n\nPain: Mr Nicklinson is comforted by his wife after the High Court ruled that a doctor should not be allowed to help him die\n\nMentally sound but locked in a body that no longer functions, Mr Nicklinson is the most powerful advocate for a change in the law to allow assisted suicides. The judge ruled, sadly but quite rightly, that it is for Parliament and the will of the people to decide if another\u2019s life can be ended in such circumstances \u2014 and what safeguards need to be in place to protect those who, unlike Mr Nicklinson, do not have loving and devoted families with their best interests at heart.\n\nChristine Bleakley has blamed the poor viewing figures of Daybreak on ITV\n\nHaving moved from her \u00a3100,000-a-year job on the BBC\u2019s One Show to ITV\u2019s Daybreak for a reported \u00a36 million, Christine Bleakley now says ITV bosses only have themselves to blame for lousy viewing figures. They hyped the show too much, she says, and \u2018it meant we were asking to be shot down\u2019. Such humility. Is it any wonder TV audiences can\u2019t stand her?\n\nSo distraught was Kristen Stewart after her tryst with a married father ended her love affair with Robert Pattinson, that she pulled out of a TV awards ceremony with her Twilight co-star. She couldn\u2019t cope with the emotional backlash, and there are now fears her career is over.\n\nTo which I have but two words of comfort \u2014 Angelina Jolie. She has gone on to make several rubbish movies and rake in millions. Hollywood, it seems, is very forgiving of blood-sucking marriage-wreckers.\n\nRichard Burton\u2019s diaries are about to be published. In them he describes Elizabeth Taylor as: \u2018The prospectus that can never be entirely catalogued . . . an ache in the stomach when I am away from her . . . a wildly exciting lover-mistress . . . beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography . . . and I shall love her for ever.\u2019 Yes, it ended in two divorces and heartache, but who would not wish to be loved in such a way?\n\nOlympic legacy\n\nFor the first time in nearly 50 years the Paralympics is almost sold out. Now a row has broken out as spectators in wheelchairs cannot sit with all the members of their families \u2014 there is not enough special seating available.\n\nNo one could have anticipated the unprecedented demand for tickets. How sad it would be if the disappointment of a handful of spectators were to take the shine off what we all want to see \u2014 the achievements of our paralympians.\n\nA fashion wannabe: Victoria Beckham performs with the Spice Girls during the Closing Ceremony\n\nEnormous fun to see the Spice Girls mime their way through two of their hits at the grand finale.\n\nBut Victoria Beckham included in the fashion hall of fame alongside Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Paul Smith and Burberry? Surely someone was having a laugh. VB is nothing but a fashion wannabe.\n\nFifty Shades Of Grey has become a best-seller with the over-70s, and the irrepressible Esther Rantzen, 72, declares she is a fan. You\u2019re never too old for wild sexual fantasies, she says. Quite so. But what happens in real life when Mr Grey is a pensioner who, instead of whipping off his Armani belt for a bit of slap and tickle, struggles with the elasticised waistband of his comfy trousers?\n\nBrady sadism goes on\n\nMoors Murderer Ian Brady is reported to have revealed where the body of his fifth child victim is buried.\n\nKeith Bennett, who would have been almost 60, was tortured to death by Brady at the age of 12. Keith\u2019s mother Winnie Johnson has maintained a lifelong campaign to get Brady to tell her where her son\u2019s body lies so she can give him a decent burial.\n\nShe is now dying of cancer. Brady\u2019s sadism lives on.\n\nVowing she\u2019s never had cosmetic surgery, Sly Stallone\u2019s 90-year-old mum Jackie seemed startlingly line-free at the premiere of her son\u2019s movie The Expendables 2. She says her extraordinary looks are due to good genes and chemical peels. So how do we account for the humungous trout pout that now looks like a whale\u2019s bottom?\n\nWestminster Noticeboard...\n\n+ The diminutive Speaker John Bercow says those who criticise him are just envious and that his reality TV star wife Sally is his \u2018asset\u2019. She\u2019s independent, he says, that\u2019s why the male-dominated media attack her.\n\nPoor deluded fool. It\u2019s not men who can\u2019t stand Sally the Alley, it\u2019s women \u2014 because she\u2019s a vulgar, self-obsessed exhibitionist parading as a feminist who has never achieved anything except on her husband\u2019s coat-tails.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron and his wife Samantha sit at a cafe during a holiday in Majorca\n\n+ Sartorial criticism of David Cameron enjoying a coffee with his wife Samantha on holiday in Mallorca is unfair. Give me our fully-clothed PM and his wife on a break he\u2019s paid for himself any day, compared with a bare-chested Tony Blair en famille on a freebie with Cherie in the Bahamas.\n\n\n\n", "images":

Olympics - Gary Neville", "text": "Like the Olympics, football has to show its humanity\n\n'Unparalleled drama and excitement'\n\n\n\n'We won't witness drama like this for a long, long time'\n\n\n\n'What was to follow blew everyone's mind into a thousand pieces'\n\n\n\n'What happened will linger long in the memories and hearts and defied belief.'\n\n\n\nNo, that's not the Olympics. That's what journalists were writing about another sporting event that took place three months ago on May 13 at the Etihad Stadium, when Sergio Aguero scored against QPR in the 94th minute to win Manchester City the Premier League, having been 2-1 down at 90 minutes and looking certain to lose the title to Manchester United.\n\n\n\nThere hasn't been a ball kicked in the Premier League since then but apparently a lot of people have decided in those intervening months that football is a waste of time, players are the lowest of the low and that there's little to look forward to on this first Super Sunday of the season.\n\n\n\nIt's back: Premier League football started again on Saturday\n\nWhat has happened since then is that we've hosted the Olympic Games and felt extremely proud as we enjoyed a fantastic two weeks of sport. But we don't half like doing ourselves down most of the time.\n\n\n\nEven a few weeks before the Olympics began they were going to be a shambles and a waste of taxpayers' money. As it turned out, we had a wonderful Olympics. But then we also have a fantastic, multicultural, global product in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nI don't mean to shy away from the real challenges football faces. We do need to link football back to the community, get closer to the fans and make it more affordable. There is excess. There are problems with the globalisation of the game. And there are incidents of ill-discipline by players.\n\n\n\nBut nothing is ever as bad as it seems and nothing is ever as good as it seems. Didn't the Olympics cost \u00a37billion more than the \u00a32.3bn that was originally quoted back in 2005? Wasn't the bronze medallist in the 100m a drug cheat who was banned for four years? Didn't an American coach accuse the 16-year-old Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen of cheating? Weren't there empty seats at venues because too many had been allocated to sponsors or Olympic officials, the same kind of corporate people that are criticised for dominating football? Weren't some of the ticket prices in the \u00a3200-\u00a3300 range? It just depends which way you want to paint the picture.\n\n\n\nHomecoming: Jessica Ennis greets fans in Sheffield\n\nI'm delighted that the Olympics were so successful and proud of the sportsmen and women who worked so hard to achieve their goals to win medals for Team GB. But it's just lazy to use their success as a stick to beat football. Some of the clich\u00e9s that have been trotted out this week are that football needs a Dave Brailsford, the magnificent performance director of our cycling team.\n\n\n\nBut it was only nine years ago that football needed a Sir Clive Woodward after he guided the rugby union team to the World Cup. We have one of the great performance coaches in Sir Alex Ferguson, following in a long line of the likes of Sir Matt Busby, Bill Nicholson, Sir Alf Ramsey, Jock Stein, Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley and Brian Clough.\n\n\n\nFootball is still one of biggest mass participation sports in this country, with 115,000 affiliated teams - and that's just for people over the age of 16. If we want to get the country moving and playing sport as part of the olympic legacy, football has a big part to play. Some of the generalisations that were thrown around last week are quite insulting. Just saying 'footballers are lazy' or 'they need to be more humble' or 'they can learn so much' are just sweeping generalisations. If we're going to criticise, at least let's be specific.\n\nIf you asked me what can football learn from the Olympics, I would cite one particular lesson. The humanity of sportsmen and women was better portrayed at the Olympics because of the more relaxed relationships between the media and athletes. Journalists showed Olympians respect and they, in turn, trusted the writers and so were open and engaging in interviews.\n\nI loved the moments of elation but the two incidents that made me sit up and think were both relative failures: the two rowers, Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter, being interviewed on the BBC after they had come second in the men's lightweight double sculls; and Dai Greene being interviewed within one-and-a-half minutes of coming fourth in the 400m hurdles. The way they spoke showed that they felt as though they had let down the country, their families and friends and themselves. They were disappointed beyond belief.\n\nHumility: Great Britain's Mark Hunter (left) and Zac Purchase apologised for their performance and it melted the hearts of the nation\n\nAs they apologised - even though they didn't need to - they demonstrated a humanity that is almost impossible not to warm to. And I know footballers are the same. I've been in dressing rooms where experienced professionals have sat with their heads in their hands for an hour, barely moving, just overcome with disappointment.\n\n\n\nI've been culpable over the years in trying to protect young players who have made mistakes by telling them: 'Don't say anything. Don't speak. Let it go away.' But what the rowers and Greene demonstrated is that when you do front up and speak after disappointments, the public will almost always give you a chance. In fact, they like to see that you feel the way they feel.\n\n\n\nIf you were to say to me what the biggest challenge is for footballers, it would be stripping away the layers of PR people and agents who speak for them. That denies players the chance to communicate their own humanity, humility and professionalism. Let's put an end to the scripted statement, issued on behalf of the player, which is always the words of a PR professional or lawyer. Let's hear from the player, especially if it's an apology.\n\n\n\nOpen: Jack Butland spoke honestly while on England duty\n\nWhen Jack Butland and Tom Cleverley spoke so well and openly while on England duty last week, you could see that young players do have a freshness and almost innocence about them.\n\n\n\nYet over the years that can be replaced by a cynicism, as quotes are twisted and small errors are magnified into back page stories. Then they retreat behind a wall of agents and PR men and give the impression that they can't speak for themselves.\n\n\n\nTo the players I would say: 'Get rid of the hangers-on and speak for yourself. Attend your contract negotiations, put yourself up for interviews, take control of how you are perceived.' But the media also have a responsibility not to abuse the trust of players who are open, and to eradicate some of cynicism that has built up over the years. That's what I'd take from a wonderful Olympics. But none of that is going to prevent me from being excited about the football season.\n\n\n\nContrary to what you may have heard and read, the two aren't mutually exclusive.

"text": "Tories sell more playing fields than Labour as seven times more applications come from Conservative councils\n\n\n\nAccording to Labour figures, Conservative councils made seven times more applications to sell school playing fields\n\n\n\nEducation Secretary Michael Gove has already come under fire for allowing sales against the advice of an independent panel\n\n\n\nConservative councils have made seven times as many applications to sell off school playing fields as Labour since the general election, it has emerged.\n\nIn the past two years, 30 out of 35 applications to sell playing fields have been made by Tory councils, according to figures unveiled by the Labour Party.\n\nFour applications were made by Labour-run councils and one by a Lib Dem council.\n\nSelling off more: Conservative councils have made seven times as many applications to sell off school playing fields as Labour since the general election\n\nThe applications threaten to undermine the central Government\u2019s pledge to give more backing to school sports.\n\nEducation Secretary Michael Gove has already come under fire for allowing the sale of school fields on five occasions against the advice of an independent panel in the past 15 months.\n\nAnd yesterday he faced claims that he allowed the sale of a playing field in one borough against advice in exchange for its Conservative council funding a free school in the area.\n\nAn independent panel last month rejected a call to sell off tennis courts at Elliott School in Putney, in the London borough of Wandsworth, but Mr Gove defied the recommendation.\n\nUnder fire: Education Secretary Michael Gove has already been criticised for selling school fields on five occasions against an independent panel's advice\n\nThe school will now be turned into an academy while its operators have received the go-ahead to build a free school in the area.\n\nTransport Secretary Justine Greening, who is a governor at the school, has also publicly backed the sell-off to \u2018provide investment\u2019 in the school.\n\n\n\nHowever, campaigners accused the Government of \u2018backroom stitch ups\u2019.\n\nStephen Twigg, shadow education secretary, said: \u2018There is clearly a very cosy relationship between Michael Gove and Tory Councils.\n\n\u2018The Tory Council applies to sell off their school playing fields, and Michael Gove gives it the nod \u2013 often flying in the face of real concerns from the independent school playing field panel.\n\n\u2018These figures show the effect a Tory Council can have.\n\n\u2018It flies in the face of the assurances that David Cameron made about our Olympic legacy.\u2019\n\nMr Twigg added that schools resorted to selling their fields because the Government had cut its schools capital budget by two thirds, leaving many desperate for funds for essential repairs.\n\nResorted to selling: Schools sell their fields because the Government cut its schools capital budget, Stephen Twigg, shadow education secretary said\n\nBut a Government source said: \u2018This is just the usual hypocrisy from Labour.\n\n\u2018Labour sold off over 200 playing fields, including dozens when Stephen Twigg was a Schools minister.\n\n\u2018The bottom line is that this Government has only approved sales if the school has closed, has merged, or if equal or better facilities are being put in their place.\u2019\n\nPressure on ministers intensified at the weekend as the outgoing chairman of the British Olympic Association said private schools should share playing fields with state schools in exchange for their tax breaks.\n\nLord Colin Moynihan suggested that sharing playing fields should be part of the \u2018public benefit\u2019 test which they have to meet to get tax breaks worth \u00a3100million a year.\n\nSpoken out: Mr Twigg, left, said the sell-offs 'fly in the face of the assurances that Cameron made about our Olympic legacy' while Lord Colin Moynihan suggested playing fields should be part of the 'public benefit' test\n\n\n\nThe former sports minister and retired silver medallist rower said: \u2018State secondary schools with good sports facilities, as well as all independent schools, should be required to share their facilities and co-operate with the primary schools in their catchment areas.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018For the independent schools, this could be part of the public benefit requirement under the Charities Act.\u2019\n\nThe Government\u2019s commitment to sports has been called into question after ministers revealed that they had approved 31 school playing field sell-offs since the general election \u2013 ten more than previously disclosed.\n\nEven playing fields at the former schools of Olympians have been sold off.\n\nDani King, a gold-medal winning cyclist, has revealed her dismay that her old school, Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, had sold off its football pitch to a housing developer.\n\nGold medalist's dismay: Dani King, who won gold in cycling, was disappointed that her old school had sold its football pitch to a housing developer\n\nThe 21-year-old said: \u2018When I was at school I used to do lots on the playing fields. We used them for PE and I would do athletics and running at the after-school club.\n\n\u2018Playing fields are training venues for future Olympians.\u2019\n\nA Department for Education spokesman declined to comment on Lord Moynihan\u2019s suggestions.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

School gym where children collapse from heat exhaustion has air-con fitted for Games removed once athletes leave\n\nRokeby School gym had air con installed especially for volleyball stars training\n\nGym blighted by overheating problems and had previously seen pupils faint due to stifling air\n\nBut LOCOG remove air con units as soon as Games finish\n\nTeachers brand 'Olympic legacy' a 'joke' and 'hypocrisy'\n\nAir conditioning units fitted at a school gym that athletes were using for training have been removed just days after the end of the Olympic games.\n\nThe gym at Rokeby School in Newham, East London was known to be stiflingly hot and one teacher claimed that pupils could only use it for 15 minutes at a time because of the high temperatures.\n\nThere have even been cases in the past of children fainting during PE lessons as a result of the conditions.\n\nTeachers at the school have now hit out at LOCOG as 'hypocrites' who were going against the idea of the Olympic legacy.\n\nThe gymnasium at Rokeby School in deprived Newham, East London, had air con installed so athletes could train there before the Olympics\n\nOrganisers agreed to install air conditioning units in the school's gym so that volleyball teams could train in the sports hall a mile away from the Olympic stadium.\n\nBut in contrast to the 'Olympic legacy' promised to East London and the rest of the capital, the generators powering the new air conditioning units were removed as soon as the Games finished.\n\nLOCOG confirmed the air conditioning units would not remain at the all-boys school, prompting critics to label the 'sporting legacy'.\n\nOne teacher at the school branded the situation 'complete hypocrisy', while other staff, including the headteacher, were said to be 'very angry'.\n\nThe teacher, who did not wish to be named, said LOCOG removed the air conditioning in the stifling gym even though the school offered to pay to keep it in place.\n\nTraining base: LOCOG temporarily upgraded the school's gym so volleyball players could train there before competing at London 2012\n\nDetails emerged as David Cameron said Britain needed to 'use the inspiration of the Games to get children playing sport more regularly'.\n\nA pupil at the boy\u2019s secondary school reportedly collapsed in the sports hall and was rushed to hospital in the last week of term - just days before air conditioning was installed for the arrival of athletes.\n\nPupils are currently limited to using the hall for 15 minutes at a time, according to teachers, one of whom went as far as saying the the building was 'making children ill'.\n\nRokeby School, in the London borough of Newham, is just a mile from the Olympic Park in Stratford, and its students come from some of the poorest families in the capital.\n\nLOCOG, which was in charge of the school site during the Games, said the sports hall did not need permanent air conditioning because term did not fall 'during the hottest summer months.'\n\nA teacher at the school, who asked not to be named said: 'We have a lot of children getting headaches and experiencing breathing problems after playing sport in there. The building is making children ill.\n\n'It is one of the most used buildings in the whole school and is used by after school clubs as well.'\n\nLegacy: Rokeby School is around one mile from the Olympics Stadium in East London\n\nSimon Shaw, 53, a former teacher at Rokeby who is close friends with a number of teaching staff at the school said: 'They are furious. They wanted to keep the air conditioning but they\u2019ve just been walked over.\n\n'There is a big issue with ventilation in the sports hall - pupils have actually collapsed from overheating. They said the Olympics were going to bring all these benefits to children in an area that really needs them and its just rubbish.\n\n\n\n'They bend over backwards for athletes, but as far as they are concerned children can just suffer.'\n\n\n\n'They bend over backwards for athletes, but as far as they are concerned children can just suffer. It is disgraceful.'\n\nA LOCOG spokeswoman said: 'The air cooling used during the Olympics is temporary. Historically it might have been needed during the hottest summer months.\n\n'Those months are not when school normally happens, so the removal will not affect the students ability to enjoy their physical education classes during regular school months.\n\n'We always made it clear that the facilities we were putting in were for the Games time period only.\n\n'The air conditioning was hired by LOCOG and therefore there was no option for the school to buy from us.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

World Cup", "text": "Rugby chiefs aim to relight Olympic fire with World Cup 2015 stadium use\n\nOrganisers of the 2015 Rugby World Cup want to use the Olympic Stadium as one of their venues for the country\u2019s next global sporting event.\n\nBut their plan to make a formal application is on hold because there is uncertainty over issues such as tenancy and future capacity.\n\nIt is expected that the stadium, which currently holds 80,000, will eventually be occupied by West Ham United.\n\nBring the magic back: Rugby chiefs want to use the Olympic Stadium\n\n\u2018We have the option of using the Olympic Park to stage matches and that is at the forefront of our minds,\u2019 said Ross Young, England Rugby 2015\u2019s chief operating officer, on Monday.\n\n\u2018The issue we have is that they (Olympic Park Legacy Company) have gone through a number of options in terms of the long-term use of the stadium. That process is still on-going and it doesn\u2019t fit into the time-line we have to operate within. The issue is we can\u2019t get finite answers.\u2019\n\nOfficials from ER 2015 have visited more than 20 venues in the past few months and reported to the organisation\u2019s board a week ago.\n\nProspective host cities have been asked to submit proposals this week to support their applications \u2014 including financial input, the provision of fan zones, organising of special events around fixtures and other initiatives.\n\nWhile a list of potential venues will be submitted to Rugby World Cup Ltd next month, the Olympic legacy authorities will be given every opportunity to ensure the stadium can join that list.\n\nFuture unknown: The next tenants of the stadium have not been decided\n\n\u2018We will give the Olympic Park Legacy Company more time to come back to us with the answers we need,\u2019 said Young. \u2018Their major workload doesn\u2019t just stop with the parade in London, so what we\u2019ve said to them is to come back to us as soon as is practicable.\n\n\u2018When you\u2019ve got a venue which worked as well as it has, with twice the number of people to get in and out (compared to projected attendances for World Cup matches), then it would be na\u00efve not to consider it.\n\n\u2018The first thing we have to answer is whether top-level rugby could be played at that venue, but for now we don\u2019t have that info.\n\n\u2018Once the draw has been made, our time-line will involve the match schedule being finalised in the first quarter of next year. Until then, there is flexibility in terms of venue selection, but if that time comes and there are still too many question marks over the Olympic Park, then we will have to decide whether to hold on any longer or allocate games to other stadiums.\u2019\n\nWait and see: The application is currently on hold\n\nA number of city and town councils around the country \u2014 largely in conjunction with local football clubs \u2014 have approached ER 2015 to make applications to host matches, leading to regional contests between rival bidding venues.\n\nIt is understood that organisers will encourage this type of competition, with examples such as Sunderland challenging Newcastle in the North East, and Derby and Coventry vying with the rugby stronghold of Leicester in the East Midlands.\n\nThere is increased interest in considering East Anglia as a location for fixtures in light of strong interest from Ipswich, while the only \u2018gap\u2019 area is one of the sport\u2019s hot-beds, the South West, due to a lack of suitable stadia. That opens the door for Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium to pick up the slack.\n\nIn London, either the Olympic Stadium or Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium will serve as the third venue, with 90,000-capacity Wembley already pencilled in and Twickenham \u2014 which is due to undergo redevelopment to improve facilities \u2014 ready to stage the opening game and final.", "images":

impresses", "text": "Pavey back on track with good showing at Great North Run\n\nAlmost 40,000 people took part in the biggest Great North Run in history on Sunday, in what could be regarded as the first step towards a successful London 2012 legacy.\n\n\n\nLord Coe hopes the Olympics will inspire two million people to take up sport. And what more inspiration could they want than five British gold medal winners to fire the starting pistol?\n\n\n\nDouble Olympic athletics champion Mo Farah, long jumper Greg Rutherford, boxer Nicola Adams, rower Kat Copeland and double Paralympic gold-medal swimmer Ellie Simmonds started proceedings.\n\n\n\nImpressive: Jo Pavey (right) enjoyed a good run\n\nFarah, who was one of the stars of the track this summer with wins in the 5,000m and 10,000m, planned to compete in the race for the first time this year. But with the arrival of twin daughters he decided to pull out.\n\n\n\nThe 29-year-old said: \u2018The last few weeks have taken their toll and it would be disrespectful to take on the distance without the necessary hard training.\u2019\n\n\n\nBut British long distance runner Jo Pavey, who finished seventh in both the women\u2019s 5,000m and 10,000m in the summer, did compete and found more success in the half marathon from Newcastle to South Shields.\n\n\n\nTaking it on the line: Wilson Kipsang wins the Men's 2012 Bupa Great North Run in Newcastle\n\nAfterwards the 38-year-old, who finished fifth, said: \u2018Having the Great North Run to get back on the roads, it\u2019s been a big target to keep training and keep the motivation there. Today there was a really tough field. There were two Olympic champions and a world champion so it was always going to be hard.\u2019\n\nIn total 39,953 crossed the finish line \u2014 the Olympic legacy has a long way to go, but this was a great start.\n\nKenya\u2019s Wilson Kipsang, who won bronze in the Olympic marathon, won the men\u2019s race.\n\nKipsang snatched victory from fellow Kenyan Micah Kogo thanks to a dramatic sprint finish that went right to the line.\n\nHe pipped Kogo to the victory in the last 20 metres in a time of 59 minutes and six seconds.\n\nPushed all the way: Kipsang celebrates winning Great North Run ahead of fellow Kenyan Micah Kogo\n\nEthiopia's Imana Merga finished third and Chris Thompson was the highest-placed Briton in sixth with a time of 61 minutes.\n\nIn the women's race, Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba powered to victory on her half marathon debut.\n\nThe three-time Olympic champion and four-time world champion, who became the first athlete to retain the Olympic 10,000 metres title this summer, saw off the challenge of 2011 world marathon champion Edna Kiplagat and 2012 Olympic Games marathon champion Tiki Gelana to claim the victory.", "images":

Young women don't want to chip their false nails", "text": "Sport? Young women don't want to chip their false nails\n\n\n\nGot a spare minute? Go online at remains ofthegames.co.uk and you can buy a pair of traffic cones for \u00a35 or an Umpire\u2019s chair for \u00a3199 \u2014 great for sitting on and bossing your partner as he mows the grass.\n\nThe site is busily flogging stuff from our Olympic venues, claiming it\u2019s \u2018a chance to own fixtures, fittings and equipment used by some of the most famous sporting personalities in the world\u2019\u2014 a dubious claim for the cones, but there\u2019s pedal bins, coat hangers and many nasty green bean bags I suppose Mighty Mo or Jessica Ennis may have possibly touched in passing.\n\nI\u2019m really sad the Games are being dismantled \u2014 we\u2019ve missed an ideal opportunity to celebrate older people in the same way as the young Olympic and Paralympic champions. Why didn\u2019t LOCOG hold a Senior Olympics immediately afterwards? When I suggested this, loads of you agreed. Masters sports events already exist, starting with a 30-35 age group and no upper age limit, so why not British Senior Olympics?\n\n\n\nSo long! Janet is sad to say goodbye to the Olympics. She says we've missed an opportunity to celebrate older people\n\nT he USA Senior Olympics are taking place all this week, in states from Louisiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, to Georgia and Arkansas. Australia holds senior Olympics, too. Over here there\u2019s been silence from Boris, Dave and Seb.\n\nA lot of bilge was written about our Olympic \u2018legacy\u2019 \u2014as sales of junk food boomed and Wetherspoons reported excellent business, our main legacy will be beer guts and muffin tops.\n\nA few more of us have signed up for gym memberships, but the reality is, once the Olympic village litter bins and beds have been flogged off, winter will be here and sport will be something most of us enjoy from our armchairs.\n\nMeanwhile, the new Culture Secretary, Maria Miller, has written to broadcasters urging them to cover more women\u2019s sport, in order to inspire young women to give up nail extensions and fake tans and start exercising.\n\nSadly, life doesn\u2019t work like that \u2014 although I\u2019d be happy to watch women\u2019s hockey and football \u2014 every year we see plenty of women playing tennis on telly at Wimbledon, and it still remains a minority spectacle here.\n\nMaria Miller ranks only 20th in a mainly male cabinet, so she has about as much clout as a wet tea towel.\n\nInstead of bleating about \u2018women\u2019 (she\u2019s also the Minister for Women, a non-job as far as Cameron is concerned) she should be implementing my superior idea of Senior Sports Championships \u2014 a generation of fit older people would be less of a burden to the NHS and thoroughly enjoy running and participating in such a prestigious event.\n\nI can enter in the doubles of the tennis and senior women\u2019s boxing, and I wouldn\u2019t even need a trendy litter bin. We senior competitors would bring our own lunches, don\u2019t require expensive kit, and can get there for nought on our Freedom passes.\n\nWhat\u2019s not to like?\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Archers has lost the plot\n\nThe most irritating characters on The Archers, are without a doubt, whining Linda Snell and bumptious Vicky Tucker, married to Mike the long-suffering milkman.\n\n\n\nWhy they feature in almost every episode is a mystery. Vicky is expecting, and has been told the baby has Down\u2019s syndrome \u2014 with the result that the series has become like a public health announcement.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve heard every detail about the risks older mums face \u2014 in fact I could sit a GCSE in human biology. To capitalise on the storyline, BBC bosses were crass enough to run an on-line poll asking if\n\n\n\nVicky should have an abortion.\n\n\n\nFollowing complaints, it was taken down. Last Friday, Vicky announced she would never have an abortion, so we can expect months of further debate about bringing up Down\u2019s children.\n\n\n\nHow about a decent plot instead of a lecture?\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A\n\n\n\nWell done! Sarah Millican is avoiding the Ambassador Theatre Group for her next tour because their online charges\n\nA couple of stories about two very different comedians \u2014 one nice, one rather creepy. Well done, Sarah Millican (right) for tweeting fans she\u2019s avoiding the Ambassador Theatre Group for her next tour, because of hefty charges they impose on customers buying tickets online. Noel Fielding, on the other hand, asked his 340,000 Twitter followers to attack an art critic who had criticised him, and then congratulated them, saying \u2018really creative pummelling\u2019. In a separate incident, he attacked another woman via Twitter, who says it made her ill. His agent says he has now closed his account \u2014 hopefully until he can get a sense of perspective.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPopular: First lady Michelle Obama takes the stage during day one of the Democratic National Convention\n\nCritics claim he\u2019s reluctant to take major decisions, but supporters say President Obama remains on top of his job by eliminating distracting clutter.\n\n\n\nThey call him No Drama Obama \u2014 he only wears grey or blue suits, works out at the same time each day, eats the same food and sets aside family time at 6pm.\n\n\n\nThis routine is designed to give him time to think about \u2018more important issues\u2019.\n\n\n\nIn his re-election campaign Michelle (pictured) is being pushed to the fore, as her popularity ratings far exceed his \u2014 last week she was campaigning in Virginia, wowing audiences with her confident speech and camera-friendly manner.\n\n\n\nI doubt that the no-choice dress code applies to the First Lady \u2014 she is a showcase for U.S. designers, and rarely wears the same dress twice at big events.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMaking time for a Danish\n\nWorried about a drop in the local birth rate, a Danish nursery offered two hours\u2019 free child care one evening a week, dubbing it \u2018quality copulation time\u2019, when couples could get together to remedy the situation and make babies.\n\n\n\nThe kindergarten (one of seven through the country which made similar offers) said that of the 42 children enrolled there, 20 would be staying the extra time last Thursday evening \u2014 a special party had been laid on so they wouldn\u2019t miss being at home.\n\n\n\nSome of the parents said they were dropping off their kids to take advantage of a bit of breathing space, but had no plans to increase the size of their families.\n\n\n\nCan you imagine anything similar here?\n\n\n\nOnly if crates of beer, cocktails and a vat of wine was laid on for the parents not the kids.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt's love that matters, Rupert\n\n\n\nI once sat on Rupert Everett\u2019s knee at a party (I\u2019d had a few drinks, I admit) \u2014 up close his imposing face seemed strangely chiselled and immobile.\n\nHe\u2019s a lot of fun \u2014 the ultimate bitch, with loads of gossip \u2014 and as the extracts from his new book demonstrate, a very talented writer.\n\n\n\nMisjudged? Rupert Everett said he can think of nothing worse than being raised by two dads\n\n\n\nAs an actor, Rupert is not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but he\u2019s just received warm reviews for his portrayal of Oscar Wilde on the London stage.\n\nAt 53, is he getting crabbier in middle age? Interviewed to promote his new book, he says: \u2018I can\u2019t think of anything worse than being brought up by two gay dads.\u2019\n\nA bit rich from a man who dressed up in drag to play a headmistress in the remake of St Trinian\u2019s, announcing he based his character on Camilla.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Rupert has been open about his sexuality, and has written about his relationships, and that he worked as a prostitute.\n\nHe comes from a military background, and perhaps he didn\u2019t want to offend his mother, but why distance himself from a community that has always supported him?", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/04/26149576-0-image-m-35_1584592153582.jpg",

Olympic Stadium move", "text": "EU probe into football aid may scupper West Ham's Olympic Stadium move\n\n\n\nWest Ham 's move to the Olympic Stadium has been thrown into doubt after European Commission officials wrote to the UK Government asking for details about potentially illegal state aid to football clubs.\n\n\n\nThe Commission, an arm of the European Union, has power to halt West Ham's bid and has written to all EU countries with the same request but The Mail on Sunday understands the letter to the UK Government specifically mentions West Ham's potential use of the Olympic Stadium.\n\n\n\n'The Commission has sent a letter to all member states about state aid to professional football,' said a European Commission spokeswoman.\n\nUncertain future: New questions have been raised about the Olympic Stadium\n\n'The aim of the letter is to provide guidance to member states, whilst at the same time asking for information about any special financial rules that may exist for professional football there.'\n\n\n\nThe EC probe could prove beneficial to Premier League clubs as it is likely to highlight subsidies paid to Spanish, French and German clubs by city councils, such as the deal by Madrid City Council to buy Real Madrid's training ground in 2001 to clear its \u00a3200million debt at a rate which critics said was preferential.\n\n\n\nBayern Munich got \u00a3168million from city and regional governments to develop the infrastructure around their AllianzArena.\n\n\n\nOlympic legacy: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce\n\nThe drawn-out process of the Olympic Stadium legacy is due to be discussed tomorrow at the board meeting of London Legacy Development Corporation, the organisation set up by Mayor of London Boris Johnson to oversee the Olympic Legacy.\n\nA final decision on the four bidders, including West Ham, is expected to be delayed.\n\n\n\nWest Ham are expected to be win the right to rent the stadium from the LLDC having initially won the initial tendering process although that was eventually scrapped.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

"date": "13/10/2012"}, "rank_42": {"title": "London 2012 Olympics came under budget", "text": "Government confirm stunning Games cost \u00a3377m LESS than they budgeted for\n\nThe cost of the London 2012 Games has come in at \u00a3377million under budget, according to Government figures released on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe overall cost of the Games is forecast at \u00a38,921billion from a budget of \u00a39,298bn.\n\n\n\nWith some contracts still to be wound up after the end of the Games, ministers are describing the underspend as a 'prudent' estimate.\n\n\n\nOlympic spirit: The Government have revealed the Games came in under budget\n\nSports minister Hugh Robertson described the feat of managing the complex programme within budget as 'a tremendous success'.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'The work of the construction and delivery teams, from the ODA (Olympic Delivery Authority) and Locog (London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games), has set a very high standard and I have no doubt that London 2012 has set a new benchmark for the management of Olympic and Paralympic Games in future.'\n\nGo figure: Hugh Robertson\n\nTalks are also still ongoing between the London 2012 organisers and G4S to get the security firm to pay back money for the fiasco over its failure to provide enough security guards for the Games.\n\n\n\nRobertson said: 'There are projected savings of at least \u00a3377m so the predictions that I made this summer that we could bring this project in at under \u00a39bn has almost certainly been met.\n\n\n\n'The \u00a3377m figure is conservative because there are lumps of contingency that are still attached to the outstanding work. The central expectation has to be in line with the rest of the project that not all of that will be needed.\n\n\n\n'Locog (the London 2012 organisers) also have to conclude, and we have to sign off, the negotiations with G4S over the size of the amount of money that will be paid back to the public purse - so if you were to add to that \u00a3377m, anything that will not be used but is held against outstanding work and anything that might come back from G4S, it is entirely reasonable to expect that figure to rise.'\n\n\n\nSome \u00a3103 million of contingency is being held to cover the remaining risks in the programme. These include the retrofit of the Olympic Village to get it ready for use when it reopens after the Games.\n\n\n\nThere are also around 2,000 contracts with the ODA, the Olympic builders and London 2012 which still have to be closed out.\n\nIn addition, \u00a3480m of uncommitted contingency still remains within the budget.\n\n\n\nThe ODA's construction and transport programme has come in at \u00a36.714bn, according to the estimates. This is a drop of \u00a347m on the previous estimated figure.\n\n\n\nThe savings made by the ODA are now at \u00a31.032bn. Overall savings have been made through 'really tough project management' by London 2012, ODA and the Government, according to Robertson.\n\nLord Coe, meanwhile, made a direct pitch to coalition ministers today for help shoring up the UK's Olympic legacy.\n\n\n\nThe peer, who is expected to be confirmed as the new chairman of the British Olympic Association next month, attended Cabinet at No 10 to make sure ministers are 'engaged in the way they need to be'.\n\nGolden Mo-ments: The Games gave the while nation a massive lift this summer\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron made the former Tory MP a 'legacy ambassador' to boost UK sport in the wake of the successful Olympic and Paralympics.\n\n\n\nEducation Secretary Michael Gove told the peer the London 2012 bounce has already led to an increase in the number of students applying to be PE teachers.\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister's spokesman said it was 'always part of the planning' that the Games would be used to improve participation in sport and change attitudes to disability.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'Lord Coe said the legacy challenge was, in many ways, the biggest challenge of the Games project. He said he was delighted the Government had picked up this issue so quickly. A lot has already happened but we need to continue to work at it to make sure there is an effective legacy.\n\n\n\n'It was an opportunity for him to hear the thoughts of the Cabinet.\n\n\n\n'Clearly, this is an issue that cuts across many departments and already lots of departments are working on aspects.

against new school field rules", "text": "Michael Gove dismisses 150,000 who signed petition against new school field rules as he vows to continue with plans\n\n\n\nNew rules will make it easier for schools to cut back size of playing fields\n\nLabour claims the move could lead to 'salami slicing' of school pitches\n\nCoalition under fire for strategy to create an Olympic legacy through schools\n\nPressing ahead: Michael Gove has said he will axe legal quotas of school fields for team sports\n\nMichael Gove yesterday vowed to press ahead with rule changes that could see hundreds of schools sell off their playing fields.\n\nThe Education Secretary remained defiant over his plans to scrap regulations setting out the minimum space schools must provide for team games, facing down critics by telling them they were simply wrong.\n\nOpponents say the rule change - due to come into force tomorrow - will make it easier for schools to justify cutting back the size of their playing fields.\n\nSince details of the move were first revealed as Britain celebrated Olympics success, an online petition has attracted more than 150,000 signatures demanding a rethink.\n\n\n\nChallenging Mr Gove in the Commons yesterday, Nic Dakin, Labour MP for Scunthorpe, said: 'Considering the need to preserve our Olympic legacy, what does the Secretary of State have to say to those 150,000 people who signed a petition against his plans which will come into force this Wednesday to scrap minimum size regulations for school playing fields?'\n\nMr Gove replied: 'I admire their passion, but they are wrong.'\n\nUnder the current rules, schools must provide between 2,500 and 75,000 square metres of space for team games depending on the number of pupils they educate.\n\nIn future, they will merely be required to provide 'suitable outdoor space' for physical education and play.\n\nThe current detailed table of minimum space requirements will be rewritten and simplified but will be laid down in non-binding guidance rather than law.\n\nThe Department for Education says the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly and cheaply to accommodate a surge in the birth rate.\n\nOfficials also say that schools will find the new rules easier to follow because bureaucratic restrictions have been removed, allowing heads to decide what is best for their pupils.\n\nBut Labour claims the move could lead to 'salami slicing' of school pitches.\n\nAn Early Day Motion tabled in the Commons by Labour leader Ed Miliband to demand the scrapping of the new regulations has been signed so far by more than a dozen MPs.\n\nOpposition: 150,000 people have signed a petition and shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg commented on the importance of having good sports facilities\n\nShadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: 'We need our schools to have the best possible sports facilities so that we encourage a new generation of Olympic athletes, and healthy and active young people.\n\n'By telling schools they no longer need proper playing fields the Government is letting down our young people.\n\n'Labour believes all pupils should have access to playing fields, regardless of where they go to school. David Cameron said he wanted to 'spread privilege' in education - he should show he means it by reversing this decision before even more damage to school sport is done.\n\n'If David Cameron believes in school sport he should back Labour's motion to protect school playing fields.'\n\nBut the DfE defended the move. A spokesman said: 'For the first time these regulations require all schools to provide space for all the activities in their PE curriculum and for outdoor play.\n\n'We have made the rules much easier for schools to follow by removing bureaucratic restrictions and freeing schools up to decide what is best for their pupils.'\n\n\n\nMinimum requirements: In the future, schools will merely be required to provide 'suitable outdoor space' for physical education and play\n\nHe said that previous rules on playing fields favoured outdoor team sports, with no requirement for schools to have space for activities in the curriculum or for play time.\n\nThe Coalition has come under intense pressure over its strategy for creating an Olympic legacy through schools.\n\nIt faced criticism for scrapping a scheme aimed at building links between schools and clubs and reducing the amount of ring-fenced cash for school sport.\n\nIts record on the sale of school pitches also came under fire with revelations that more than 30 had been sold off since 2010 despite a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement.\n\nSome decisions to allow sales had been taken against the advice of a panel of experts.",

site used for the temporary equestrian centre, which remains a muddy quagmire and closed to the public six months after the end of the games.\n\nQueen's field in Greenwich Park was transformed into a spectacular venue for the equestrian events which saw thousands of spectators cheering Team GB's Olympic and Paralympic teams to victory.\n\nBut today some 45 acres remain fenced-off to the public and are likely to stay shut until summer, meaning they will be closed for an entire year.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nQuagmire: Queen's field in Greenwich Park, the site of the temporary equestrian

Cambridge, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry look on during the show jumping at Greenwich Park on July 31\n\nLocal residents have accused Olympic organising committee Locog of not employing sufficient staff and failing to re-lay the grass before the onset of winter.\n\nCircus Field on neighbouring Blackheath, which is a nature-conservation area and home to acid grassland, was transformed into a staging area for the events and also suffered damage.\n\n\n\nBefore the start of the games the Queen's granddaughter and Olympic medallist Zara Phillips said it would be pointless building a temporary venue that would simply have to be taken down again\n\nSev D'Souza, who led the 'No to Greenwich Olympic Equestrianism campaign', told the Daily Telegraph : 'This is the only green space within walking distance for many thousands of people and the most popular, accessible part of the park will have been out of bounds for more than a year.\n\n'We were promised by Locog that it would be back to normal as soon as was possible, but then they employed hardly any people to work on the site, so the work has not been completed. What we're left with is a mess.'\n\nIt cost an estimated \u00a3120 million to transform Greenwich Park for the games which saw Britain's Nick Skelton triumph in the showjumping and Charlotte Dujardin in the dressage.\n\n\n\nThere was success for Britain in the Paralympics events saw Sophie Christiansen and Natasha Baker both take gold with the British team collect a record 11 medal haul.\n\nBut the decision to use Greenwich as the site for the temporary centre had come under a great deal of criticsm before the start of the games.\n\nIn a 2009 interview with the Times, the Queen's grandaughter Zara Phillips, who would later leave Greenwich with a silver medal, said it would be pointless building a temporary venue that would simply have to be taken down again.\n\nShe said: 'Why don't you do it to a space that can used with a legacy, not Greenwich Park where people walk their dogs?'\n\n\n\nA Locog spokesman blamed bad weather at the end of the Paralympic games but said the park should be restored by Spring.\n\n\n\nHe said: 'Locog handed back the venue last month. We believe the condition of Greenwich Park will continue to improve. It will flourish by next spring, at the end of a full growing season.\n\nFenced off: Some 45 acres of Greenwich Park is likely to remain shut until summer meaning it will have been closed for an entire year Greenwich Park, looking pristine during the 2012 Olympics competition in the summer\n\nNick Skelton (left) and Sophie Christiansen (right) ride to Olympic and Paralympic victory at Greenwich during the 2012 games Great Britain's Mhairi Spence showjumping in the Women's Modern Penthathlon at Greenwich\n\n'We did have bad weather at the end of the Paralympic Games, which cost us a bit of time.\n\n'The reinstatement programme has been agreed with Royal Parks and is being implemented by them, and we have abided by all our planning conditions, working with English Heritage and Natural England.\n\n'The acid grassland is already in better condition.'\n\nGreat Britain fans show their support during the Individual Jumping Equestrian on Day 12 of the London 2012 Olympic Games at Greenwich Park on August 8\n\nAn aerial view of the Greenwich Park Equestrian Centre before the Games started\n\nVIDEO But can you put it back?

Wiggins", "text": "Gongs galore: 127 Olympians led by Sir Wiggo scoop New Year honours - but there's no Sir Mo Farah or Dame Jess Ennis\n\nOlympic athletes , coaches and organisers comprise 10% of honours list\n\nUK's first Tour de France winner Wiggins to be given knighthood\n\nParalympic cycling champion Sarah Storey is to be made a dame\n\nFour-time Olympic gold medalist Ben Ainslie also to be knighted\n\n\n\nCBEs for Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah, David Weir and Victoria Pendleton\n\nWiggins describes his 'disbelief' and says it is 'an incredible honour'\n\n\n\nArise Sir Wiggo: Bradley Wiggins, Britain's first Tour de France champion, has been given a knighthood in the New Year's honours list\n\nBritain's Olympic heroes have been rewarded for their success with a record number of gongs in the New Year honours list.\n\nThe athletes, coaches and organisers who brought delight to the nation this summer dominate the list like no other group before them.\n\nA staggering 127 awards have been handed out to those involved \u2013 more than 10 per cent of the total. The figure is unprecedented in the 122-year history of the list.\n\nAmong the 78 athletes and coaches honoured were cyclist Bradley Wiggins and sailor Ben Ainslie, who both received knighthoods.\n\nSir Bradley, as he will be known, made sporting history this year by becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France, and followed the feat by scooping an Olympic gold, as well as being crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year.\n\n\n\nHe heads a sparkling list of sporting heroes, including Paralympic cyclist Sarah Storey, who was made a dame, and Jessica Ennis, Victoria Pendleton, Mo Farah and David Weir, who all received CBEs.\n\nWiggins, affectionately known as Wiggo, said: \u2018It\u2019s quite something really. I never imagined that I would ever become a knight, so it\u2019s an incredible honour, but there\u2019s a slight element of disbelief, and it will take a while to sink in. There was never any doubt whether I\u2019d accept it or not, it was more a case that I never saw myself as a Sir, and I probably never will.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe honours crown a year of excellence in British sport \u2013 so much so that a special honours list was added to recognise the 65 medals, 29 of them gold, won at this year\u2019s Olympic Games, as well as the 120 medals \u2013 including 34 golds \u2013 won at the Paralympic Games.\n\nThere was also recognition for those behind the Games. Lord Coe, who headed London\u2019s bid team, becomes a Companion of Honour, while Jean Tomlin, who led the Games Maker programme for volunteers to help the event run smoothly, gets an OBE.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nKnight of the road: Wiggins followed his Tour de France triumph with an Olympic gold and was also named BBC Sports Personality of the Year\n\nKing Cool: Bradley Wiggins, pictured right in Manchester on Thursday night, said: 'It\u2019s quite something really. I never imagined that I would ever become a knight'\n\nBut eyebrows were raised that Mo Farah received only a CBE for his historic double track triumph in the 5000m and 10000m. In 2005, Kelly Holmes was made a dame for winning both the 400m and 800m at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Heptathlete gold medallist and London 2012 poster girl Jessica Ennis will also have to be content with a CBE.\n\nAndy Murray, who won Olympic tennis gold before becoming Britain\u2019s first men\u2019s Grand Slam champion for 76 years, can perhaps count himself unlucky to receive just an OBE.\n\n\n\nIt was also noted that while Sarah Storey was made a dame after her four golds at 2012, her Paralympic teammate, wheelchair athlete David Weir, who also got four golds, was made merely a CBE.\n\nThere was no mention of Danny Boyle, creator of the epic Olympics opening ceremony, who reportedly turned down a knighthood, or Stephen Daldry, who staged the closing party.\n\nVIDEO Sir Bradley will take some getting used to\n\nChampion: Ben Ainslie, who won four successive Olympic sailing golds, has received a knighthood in the list\n\nSupreme: Sarah Storey is the UK's most successful ever Paralympian and is to be made a dame\n\n\n\nThere was also nothing for cyclist Chris Hoy, who with six gold medals became Britain\u2019s most successful ever Olympian during the Games, because he had already been knighted after his heroics at the previous Olympics in Beijing.\n\nIn 2008, when Britain came fourth in the Olympics\u2019 medal table at Beijing, 54 honours were awarded in the New Year honours list.\n\nStorey, 35, who now has 11 Paralympic gold medals in total and is pregnant with her first child, said: \u2018I can\u2019t believe the number of times we\u2019ve said this year, \u201cOh, can 2012 possibly get any better?\u201d We feel so fortunate that 2012 will always stand out as being the most incredible year.\n\n\u20182012 has been quite amazing. I am still pinching myself, literally.\u2019\n\n\n\nNation's favourite: Jessica Ennis, who was the face of the Olympics for home fans, received CBEs after her heptathlon triumph in London\n\nInspiring: Jessica Ennis was the London 2012 poster girl and finished closely behind Bradley Wiggins in the running to be BBC Sports Personality of the Year\n\n\n\nBesides Wiggins and Ainslie, the most decorated sailor in Olympic history with four gold medals at four consecutive Games, knighthoods also go to Dave Brailsford and David Tanner, performance directors at British Cycling and British Rowing.\n\nAinslie said: \u2018This is an incredible honour. When I set out Olympic sailing 20 years ago, I never would have dreamt this would happen.\u2019\n\nCBEs also went to rower Katherine Grainger and cyclist Victoria Pendleton.\n\nLady in red: Jessica Ennis attends the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards in London\n\nOBEs go to equestrians Sophie Christiansen and Charlotte Dujardin, Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds and cycling couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny.\n\nAmong those to get MBEs are boxer Nicola Adams; canoeist Timothy Baillie; equestrians Laura Bechtolsheimer and Carl Hester; rowers Katherine Copeland and Helen Glover; wheelchair racer \u2018Hurricane\u2019 Hannah Cockcroft; and Paralympic swimmer Josef Craig.\n\nTriathlon gold medallist Alistair Brownlee gets an MBE but brother Jonathan, who took bronze, misses out, while the MBE also goes to Welsh taekwondo gold medallist Jade Jones, Paralympic blade runner Jonnie Peacock, long jump hero Greg Rutherford and silver medal gymnast turned Strictly Come Dancing star Louis Smith.\n\n\u2018To receive this honour is out of this world and something I never would have dreamt of as I grew up in the sport of gymnastics,\u2019 said Smith, 23.\n\n\u2018This year has been like no other for so many reasons.\n\n\u2018For me it\u2019s obviously one I\u2019ll never forget and I wasn\u2019t sure it could get any better, but to be awarded an MBE is the icing on the cake and without a doubt the proudest moment of my life.\n\n\u2018I just hope this acts as even more inspiration for future generations within sport in this country, further continuing the Olympic legacy.\u2019\n\nSwimmer Simmonds, 18, who won two more golds at London 2012 making her a four-time Paralympic champion, said: \u2018It\u2019s been a great honour to be included in the list which caps an amazing year for me personally and for British sport.\u2019\n\n\n\nVIDEO Rowing hero Helen Glover MBE 'an incredible privilege'\n\nThe honours also recognise those who contributed to London 2012 in a \u2018non-sporting capacity\u2019, with 49 \u2018back-room\u2019 staff from Paul Deighton, who was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, down to a MBE for volunteer Muhammed Khan.\n\nAway from sport, the Companion of Honour goes to Professor Peter Higgs, namesake of the Higgs boson or so-called \u2018God particle\u2019, which was finally proved to exist in July, 48 years after he first proposed it.\n\nNo Sir Mo: Mo Farah's gold medal-winning triumphs provided fans with two of the London Olympics greatest moments\n\nLightning: Mo Farah missed out on a knighthood but has been awarded a CBE Recognition: Cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who appeared on this year's Strictly Come Dancing, has been awarded a CBE\n\nRecognised with an MBE in the Diplomatic and Overseas list was also Captain Raymond \u2018Jerry\u2019 Roberts, 92, one of the four founder members of Bletchley Park\u2019s Testery section, tasked with breaking the German top-level code during the Second World War.\n\nAn MBE also goes to Penelope Clough, 53, who set up the Justice For Jane Campaign with husband John after her daughter was murdered by her ex-partner in 2010 while he was on bail.\n\nSport makes up about 10 per cent of this year\u2019s awards, education 10 per cent, health 7 per cent, and industry and the economy make up 12 per cent.\n\nA Cabinet Office spokesman said an unprecedented number of people from the sporting world had received honours.\n\nHe said: \u2018As we\u2019ve seen with the special list for Olympians and Paralympians, there is a desire to continue to expand the honours system and make sure we\u2019re extending the reach.\u2019\n\nNorthern star: Tennis champion Andy Murray enjoyed his most successful ever year as a tennis player winning both Olympic gold and the U.S. Open\n\nGolden girl: Swimmer Ellie Simmonds has been awarded an OBE, making the list despite being only 18-years-old\n\n\n\n", "images":

So far its all smoke and glitter", "text": "Laura Williamson: London's legacy? So far its all smoke and glitter\n\n\n\nGood old beach volleyball. If we learned nothing else from London 2012, it\u2019s that a skimpy outfit, a very shouty MC and loud pop music can breathe new life into even the most straightforward of games. That, at least, seems to be the sum of Britain\u2019s Olympic legacy so far if Saturday night television is anything to go by.\n\nThis week we had two of the Games\u2019 broadcasting stars, Gabby Logan and Clare Balding, going head-to-head on primetime TV, while the world\u2019s best squash players pitted their wits at the Queen\u2019s Club in a Perspex box with pink branding over on Sky.\n\n\n\nEven in the most traditional of competitions, the FA Cup, there was some chap called Lethal Bizzle entertaining us before kick-off at Upton Park. Quite what Sir Trevor Brooking made of it, I\u2019m not sure.\n\nSplash: Daley part of ITV's reality diving show on Saturday night\n\nWe\u2019ve had Victoria Pendleton and Louis Smith on Strictly Come Dancing, a rain-sodden Superstars revival and now Luke Campbell and Beth Tweddle in Dancing on Ice. Then there\u2019s Splash! (The exclamation mark, I\u2019m afraid, is part of the title.)\n\nWhile Balding was glammed up to present a new BBC game show called Britain\u2019s Brightest, Logan was on ITV in a neon pink shift dress (very London 2012 logo) watching people of varying degrees of fame try to dive. Not in a Gareth Bale way as she often does on a Saturday, but into water. Thank goodness Jo Brand was on hand to provide advice.\n\nNo diving show, of course, would be complete without Britain\u2019s favourite bronze medallist, Tom Daley. There he was, distributing words of wisdom with the poise of an 18-year-old destined for a lengthy television career. The future of a show that was more Eurotrash than European Championships remains to be seen.\n\nIt was bonkers. As I waited for Sam Allardyce to speak after West Ham\u2019s draw with Manchester United, I couldn\u2019t help notice a few colleagues\u2019 eyes wandering to TV screens in the press rooms. A girl in a gold bikini was prancing around a pool in Luton on one set.\n\nBalding was on the other, encouraging a contestant to guess the person whose first name was represented by a sheep and bra (Barbara Windsor, if you\u2019re wondering).\n\nThese programmes seem to be the result of television\u2019s lust to recreate the heady days of last summer. The premise of reality TV is that people become overnight stars and this, to an extent, was true of the Games. Yet Britain\u2019s short-term legacy seems to be about the fun and razzle-dazzle of London 2012: flash those multi-coloured lights and turn up the music, please.\n\nVenue: Horse Guards Parade hosted the Olympic beach volleyball competition\n\nWHAT THEY SAID\n\nVictoria Azarenka withdrew from the Brisbane International this week because she got an infection in her toe from \u2018a bad pedicure experience\u2019. Last year\u2019s Australian Open champion said: \u2018The doctor said it happens a lot.\u2019 Not if you\u2019re the world\u2019s No 1 tennis player, it doesn\u2019t.\n\nSuch is the frenzy, there were calls this week to make darts an Olympic sport after Phil Taylor\u2019s thrilling win over Michael van Gerwen in the PDC World Championship final. A discipline so dominated by men does not have a cat in hell\u2019s chance of being included, yet darts\u2019 fun, brash package gives us a prototype sports are falling over themselves to follow.\n\nBarry Hearn\u2019s at it again with ping pong, enticing 64 of the world\u2019s best to Alexandra Palace with a $100,000 prize fund, blaring music and bats designed to reduce speed and spin. Even netball\u2019s having a go, with a high-energy version - Fast Net - aiming for a new audience. It worked for Rugby Sevens after all, which debuts in Rio in 2016.\n\nBut amid the splash, glitter and razzmatazz on TV, spare a thought for beach volleyball. Last summer\u2019s beer-swilling bash at Horse Guards Parade gave it exposure beyond its sporting value, but also made it a bit of a laughing stock. The sport revelled in its moment, but there were no long-term foundations rooted in that temporary sandpit next to Downing Street.\n\nIt\u2019s the same with TV\u2019s attempts to jump on the bandwagon. It\u2019s all good fun, but is our Olympic ideal to be boiled down to a blast of artificial smoke and a cascading wall of glitter? Going by Saturday, those hopes for our grand Olympic legacy will be gone before you can say \u2018Splash!\u2019\n\nAND THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WEEK\n\n\n\nAt QPR on Friday, Harry Redknapp summed up one of the most irritating things in football: players not celebrating when they score against a former club.\n\n\n\n\u2018Inside they\u2019re going, \u201cHave that. It\u2019ll teach you to get rid of me\u201d,\u2019 said the QPR boss, laughing. \u2018But outside they\u2019re going, \u201cOh no, I didn\u2019t want to score\u201d. Great, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\n\n\nHappy return: Shaun Wright-Phillips didn't celebrate his winner against former club Chelsea\n\nTWEET OF THE WEEK\n\nMatch of the Day presenter Gary Lineker during ITV\u2019s - admittedly awful - FA Cup highlights show on Saturday night. \u2018Funny, you\u2019re never as popular as when you\u2019re not around. #motd\u2019. Mee-ow.\n\nWatching the BBC\u2019s coverage of the Great Edinburgh Cross-Country. Steve Cram\u2019s commentary was as authoritative as ever but it needed to be because, despite big names in the women\u2019s 3km invitational race and an exciting finish to the men\u2019s event, it looked like a souped-up sports day. While it\u2019s great to see more athletics on TV, the casual viewer might have been put off . . .", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

throw a ball or run when they start secondary school", "text": "Thousands of pupils 'hardly move' by the time they start secondary school and are unable to jump, throw a ball or run, warns head of UK Sport\n\nSusan Campbell claims thousands of 11-year-olds are 'physically illiterate'\n\nOlympic legacy could be lost without specialist training for primary teachers\n\nShe warned some pupils unable to take part in basic sports when they leave for secondary school\n\n\n\nThousands of children are starting secondary school unable to run, jump, throw a ball or catch, the head of UK Sport has said.\n\n\n\nSusan Campbell has claimed 'physically illiterate' children 'hardly move' by the time they are ready to make the transition from primary school.\n\n\n\nAnd she said the legacy of the Olympics in the summer could be lost if teachers in primary schools did not receive specialist PE training.\n\nBaroness Campbell (left) has said thousands of children are starting secondary school unable to run, jump, throw a ball or catch, and has called for extra training in PE for primary school teachers\n\n\n\nThe head of UK Sport said some children 'hardly move' by the time they leave primary school\n\nShe warned some 11-year-olds aren't able to take part in the most basic of sports by the time they go to secondary school.\n\nBaroness Campbell, chairwoman of UK Sport and the Youth Sport Trust, said sport should be taken as seriously as literacy and numeracy in primary schools.\n\nAnd she has called for primary school teachers to receive extra training in PE.\n\nShe told the London Evening Standard while there was enthusiasm among youngsters to get involved in sport after the Olympics, they may miss out because of a lack of training among primary school teachers.\n\n\n\nBaroness Campbell said about 20 per cent of pupils aged five are overweight when they start school, and the statistics only get worse as they make their way through school.\n\n\n\nShe said: 'Some secondary school teachers have 11-year-old pupils who hardly move, let alone catch or run.\n\n\n\nBaroness Campbell has said sport should be taken as seriously as literacy and numeracy at primary levels\n\n'If a teacher has ten children out of 30 like that in the class, it is a job to give them the focus they need.\n\n\n\n'They can\u2019t catch, throw, jump or run \u2014 the fundamental basic movements of every sport.'\n\nSpeaking before the North of England Education Conference, in Sheffield, Baroness Campbell said primary school teachers receive minimal training in PE, with most saying they do not feel confident in giving lessons in the subject.\n\nThe Department for Education has said competitive sport is being placed at the centre of its reforms of schools, according to The Telegraph.\n\n\n\nIt said it was looking to raise the status of sport in primary schools and was staging an Olympic-style school games.\n\n\n\nBaroness Campbell has warned some children 'hardly move' by the time they make the transition to secondary school\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

"text": "Back in the running: Path cleared for Bolt to compete in London on Games anniversary after Osborne gives athletes tax exemption\n\nChancellor George Osborne has granted a 'one-off' tax exemption to athletes competing in this summer's London Grand Prix, paving the way for Usain Bolt to run again at the Olympic Stadium.\n\n\n\nExcluding last summer's Games, the fastest man in the world has not raced in this country since 2009 because tax rules mean he would have to pay on his global income, including multi-million dollar sponsorship deals, as well as on his earnings for the Grand Prix.\n\n\n\nOsborne's decision comes following a series of meetings with former London 2012 chairman and Olympics legacy ambassador Lord Coe, who had lobbied for the exemption.\n\nStar attraction: Bolt was not expected to compete at this year's London Grand Prix\n\nOsborne said: 'The Government is determined to do everything possible to secure the Olympic legacy and I am delighted to grant this exemption.'\n\n\n\nThe world's leading athletes have made a habit of withdrawing from the London Grand Prix in recent years but after it was moved to the Olympic Stadium from its usual home of Crystal Palace to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the Olympics, the need for Bolt and Co to compete was made apparent to Osborne.\n\n\n\nThe Grand Prix - predicted to be a sell-out - is expected to be held over two days, starting with an evening session on Friday, July 26.\n\nU-turn: The door is open for Bolt to return to the Olympic Stadium\n\nBolt\u2019s agent, Ricky Simms, has welcomed Osborne\u2019s decision: 'It\u2019s good news for the Diamond League meeting and British sport in general.\n\n\n\n'The rules were discouraging a lot of the top stars from competing in the UK when they had options elsewhere.'\n\n\n\nHe added: 'I think it\u2019s about two weeks before the World Championships, which is quite late, but it\u2019s London and it\u2019s the Olympic Stadium again so it obviously has an attraction.'\n\nUsual setting: Crystal Palace will not be hosting the Grand Prix this year\n\nOsborne's exemption covers appearances fees, prize money and sponsorship income but it only covers non-resident athletes.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/02/07/article-2274849-168B3937000005DC-298_634x410.jpg",

League", "text": "Bolt to earn \u00a310,000 PER SECOND after agreeing to run 200m at Paris Diamond League\n\nUsain Bolt will earn a staggering \u00a310,000-a-second when he runs the 200m at the Paris Diamond League meeting this summer.\n\nThe triple Olympic champion will earn \u00a3200,000 as he warms up for the World Championships in August by competing in the French capital on July 6.\n\n\n\nOrganisers of the London Grand Prix on July 27 still hope to attract the Jamaican after the removal of a tax law.\n\nStreets ahead: Usain Bolt will command \u00a3200,000 to run in Paris\n\nBolt has committed to two other races this year, a 150m event on Brazil's Copacabana beach on March 31 and the 200m race at Oslo's Bislett Games on June 13.\n\n\n\nBolt, 26, will also compete in a 150m race on Brazil\u2019s Copacabana beach on March 31. His only other confirmed event is over 200m at Oslo\u2019s Bislett Games on June 13.\n\nDespite his extravagant fee, Paris director Laurent Boquillet insists it will be money well spent.\n\n\n\n'With Bolt, we know that we will easily fill the Stade de France,' he said.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Chancellor George Osborne granted a 'one-off' tax exemption to athletes competing in this summer's London Grand Prix, paving the way for Bolt to run again at the Olympic Stadium.\n\n\n\nExcluding last summer's Games, the fastest man in the world has not raced in this country since 2009 because tax rules mean he would have to pay on his global income, including multi-million dollar sponsorship deals, as well as on his earnings for the Grand Prix.\n\nFans favourite: Bolt may return to London for this summer's Grand Prix\n\nOsborne's decision comes following a series of meetings with former London 2012 chairman and Olympics legacy ambassador Lord Coe, who had lobbied for the exemption.\n\nOsborne said: 'The Government is determined to do everything possible to secure the Olympic legacy and I am delighted to grant this exemption.'\n\n\n\nThe world's leading athletes have made a habit of withdrawing from the London Grand Prix in recent years but after it was moved to the Olympic Stadium from its usual home of Crystal Palace to mark the one-year anniversary of the start of the Olympics, the need for Bolt and Co to compete was made apparent to Osborne.\n\n\n\nBolt\u2019s agent, Ricky Simms, welcomed Osborne\u2019s decision: 'It\u2019s good news for the Diamond League meeting and British sport in general.\n\n'The rules were discouraging a lot of the top stars from competing in the UK when they had options elsewhere.'\n\n\n\nHe added: 'I think it\u2019s about two weeks before the World Championships, which is quite late, but it\u2019s London and it\u2019s the Olympic Stadium again so it obviously has an attraction.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images":

is not a blow to London 2012 legacy", "text": "Shutting down of Don Valley Stadium is not a blow to London 2012 legacy, says Coe\n\nSebastian Coe will keep a close eye on the future of athletics in Sheffield with Jessica Ennis\u2019 hometown track at Don Valley Stadium due to close in September.\n\nLord Coe, who grew up in the city, insisted the decision was not a slight on the Olympic legacy and said the plans to refurbish nearby Woodbourn Road were \u2018actually quite thoughtful\u2019.\n\nDon Valley, the second largest track and field facility in the country, will shut later this year after Sheffield City Council opted to save \u00a3700,000 a year as part of \u00a350million of cuts.\n\nDemolished: Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield is to be demolished as a cost-cutting measure\n\nEnnis\u2019 coach, Toni Minichiello, has claimed the closure of Don Valley will be a \u2018hefty blow\u2019 to her chances of retaining her Olympic heptathlon title in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nLord Coe, speaking ahead of the Laureus World Sport awards in Rio, said: \u2018Sheffield needs a track-and-field facility. Of course, people are going to watch it closely.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know (about Ennis), because I haven\u2019t spoken to her about it. My own instinct is if Sheffield are not committing to international track and field then I can understand why a 25,000-seater arena that costs \u00a3700,000 a year to maintain is a drain on the resources.\n\n\n\nHome: The 25,000-seat stadium is the spiritual home of Olympics golden girl Jessica Ennis\n\n'I\u2019ve seen the proposal for the refurbishment of the Don Valley area. It\u2019s actually quite a thoughtful proposal.\n\n\u2018Now, clearly, it\u2019s not something that the legacy team in Government has a view on. These are things that are driven by local priorities. But there is a legacy there and it\u2019s actually quite a strong one.\u2019\n\n\n\nLord Coe also admitted the British Olympic Association, of which he is chairman, may not appoint a new chief executive after the departure of Andy Hunt, who resigned last month.\n\n\n\nSympathy: Lord Coe, who received an honour at Buckingham Palace earlier this week, does not believe it will affect legacy from London 2012\n\nHunt, who was also the Chef de Mission, left his post after failing to attract new sponsors to support the BOA, even after the success of London 2012.\n\n\u2018We are still looking at all sorts of things,\u2019 said Coe when asked if the BOA would appoint a new chief executive. \u2018We\u2019ve got a very good management team in there that\u2019s doing an extremely good job.\u2019\n\n\n\n'We need to take a lot of fragility out of the balance sheet and it\u2019s important for an organisation to be able to have that certainty of revenue and the costs under control.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

demolition\n\nA major redevelopment of Don Valley Stadium, described as the 'biggest Olympic legacy project outside London', was unveiled by former sports minister Richard Caborn in Sheffield this morning.\n\n\n\nPlans for the site of the condemned stadium which produced Olympic champion Jessica Ennis include a refurbished Woodburn Road athletics track, a high-performance centre and new homes for Sheffield Eagles and Titans rugby union clubs.\n\n\n\nThe decision to close and demolish the \u00a329million Don Valley Stadium as part of council cost-cutting measures was announced earlier this month and drew criticism from Ennis and her coach Toni Minichiello.\n\n\n\nDoomed: The Don Valley Stadium is scheduled to be torn down\n\nCaborn is confident today\u2019s announcement will win over the critics, although plans are currently at the embryonic stage.\n\n\n\nAddressing a news conference at the neighbouring English Institute of Sport, Caborn said: 'This is the result of intensive work by a small group of significant organisations in the Sheffield city region to consider a future for the Don Valley Stadium.\n\n\n\n'It is a unique scheme which has already received funding to go to the feasibility stage.'\n\n\n\nCaborn, who began to explore the plans in January, told the conference the development could be completed at a cost of around \u00a340million and that the new 12,000-capacity rugby stadium could be ready by the summer of 2015.\n\n\n\nHe said the plans also include facilities for gymnastics and basketball and a venue to stage qualifying matches for the World Snooker Championship at the city centre Crucible.\n\n\n\nAmbitious: Developers want to build a multi-purpose venue on the site\n\nHowever, Sheffield Council leader Julie Dore sounded a note of caution in admitting that no council funding would be available for the project.\n\n\n\n'It is an idea so we do need the full costings and the full timetable, so the next stage is to agree to do a feasibility study,' she told the conference.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

grant for primary school sport too late to capitalise on London 2012 Olympic legacy", "text": "\u00a3150m investment in primary school sport is arriving too late to inspire a generation\n\n\n\nIt rather grated seeing David Cameron chucking a rugby ball around with kids in Millwall, east London, this weekend \u2014 and not only because the track-suited Prime Minister so desperately wanted to beat Lord Coe in a relay race.\n\nNo, it jarred because it was an event to mark the Government\u2019s \u00a3150m annual investment in primary school sport; an announcement we are all supposed to applaud. It turns out it matters, this getting children to enjoy and embrace sport and PE before they reach secondary school lark.\n\nWell I never.\n\nLegacy: David Cameron announced a \u00a3150m investment in primary school sport at a rugby club in Millwall, east London, on Saturday - but it is less than originally promised and too late to capitalise on the Olympic buzz\n\nSaturday\u2019s announcement was a step in the right direction, of course, but it still represents a cut in the \u00a3162m of ring-fenced cash for School Sport Partnerships (SSPs) that Education Minister Michael Gove so disgracefully slashed in 2010 before partially restoring them in fragmented form.\n\nIt is also at least seven months too late, coming long after the buzz of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and therefore missing the ideal time to \u2018capitalise on the inspiration\u2019, as Mr Cameron put it.\n\nThe symbolism of this investment \u2014 delayed, though it is \u2014 in primary school sport is important because it shows what anyone with a brain knew anyway, that sport matters, but it is naive to try and dress it up as a truly effective way of delivering an Olympic legacy.\n\nWith three different government departments contributing cash, the scheme feels haphazard; a disjointed response to the fact ordinary people \u2014 parents, teachers, volunteers \u2014 were determined not to let this one go.\n\nThey did not argue for the five-star sports facilities of the private sector in their state schools, but they had seen the success of SSPs. They knew that, if you do not capture a child\u2019s enthusiasm for running around by the time they leave primary school, you have probably lost them to the PlayStation forever.\n\nStart 'em young: The sports scheme is designed to capture the imagination of primary school kids at an early age\n\nAt the end of 2010, 90 per cent of pupils were doing PE for at least two hours a week and 78 per cent were taking part in competitive sport.\n\nAn Ofsted report said the partnerships had left a \u2018notable legacy\u2019 \u2014 no thanks, of course, to Mr Gove.\n\nThe new initiative will provide \u00a39,250 a year for a primary school with 250 pupils to spend on sport; enough to pay for a specialist PE teacher or coach to work two days a week, for example.\n\n\n\nSSPs were organised by the Youth Sport Trust but private firms will now surely be queuing up to provide the personnel. Some will be brilliant, talented and inspirational, but for others it will just be a way to pay for their gap years, or their kids\u2019 gap years.\n\n\n\nIt feels like it will be luck of the draw, as so often with the way sport is delivered in this country.\n\nAn interesting sideline, though, is a pilot scheme to train more primary school teachers to teach PE.\n\nSlashed: Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, cut a sports investment of \u00a3162m a year in 2010 and replaced it with a fragmented \u00a3150m annual grant\n\nI\u2019m sure we all have memories of being dumped on a field while Mr Matthews demonstrated his cover drive or regaled us with tales of how he could have played for Manchester United. Or PE \u2018lessons\u2019 where the class spent 30 minutes getting changed and then you spent so long standing still that it was hardly worth the bother.\n\nAs Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the YST pointed out, children\u2019s experience of school sport has long been \u2018delivered by teachers who lack the confidence and in some cases the competence to deliver PE well\u2019.\n\nThat needs to change. It did once, with the introduction of SSPs, and, hopefully, it will do again.\n\nBut please save us the baloney that this investment will \u2018benefit a whole generation of children for many years to come\u2019. It is a welcome move forward, but it remains a disgrace an Olympic host nation had to go two steps backwards to get there.\n\nWHAT THEY SAID\n\nWhen asked how he felt about handing back his Olympic 4x400metre relay medal from the Sydney Olympics after team-mate Antonio Pettigrew admitted doping, Michael Johnson rolled his eyes.\n\n\u2018It was frustrating,\u2019 he said, \u2018because we were so good we could have won with anybody in the team, even you.\u2019 Point taken.\n\nDisgraced: The victorious US 4x400m relay team from the Sydney Olympics in 2000 handed back their medals after Antonio Pettigrew (right) admitted to doping\n\nWHAT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WEEK...\n\nSPOKE to Jessica Ennis ahead of the Laureus World Sports Awards in Rio de Janeiro. The main topic, as we chatted, was the closure of Don Valley Stadium, 6,000 miles away in Sheffield.\n\nYou can take the girls out of Yorkshire\u2026\n\nWATCHED Wales\u2019s emphatic victory over England on Saturday and then listened to all and sundry say defeat was actually a good thing because \u2018it will make England stronger\u2019. Would we afford the same courtesy to our football team? I think not\u2026\n\n\n\nDejection: England blew their Grand Slam attempt against Wales, but the experience should 'make them stronger'\n\nRACIST chanting marred Tottenham\u2019s 4-1 defeat by Inter Milan. Yet the Italian journalists looked at us English counterparts with incredulity when we asked about it. It is so common they think we are being hyper-sensitive, and that is the scariest thing of all.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF THE WEEK\n\n", "images":

right to quit Upton Park? Yes No Are West Ham right to quit Upton Park? Yes 2998 votes\n\nNo 3084 votes Now share your opinion\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Ham United are today celebrating the historic announcement by Mayor of London Boris Johnson granting them the right to make the Olympic Stadium their home from the start of the 2016/17 season.\n\n\n\nThe Hammers have released exciting artist's impressions of the new stadium design this morning, with the reported \u00a3150million facelift due to be completed in time for the 2016-17 season.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium will be transformed into a 54,000-seater venue, with the Hammers now set to embark on a detailed, independent supporter consultation process.\n\n'It's fantastic for everyone at West Ham United that at last all the club's hard work over the past three years has paid off,' joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said.\n\nVision of the future: What the Olympic Stadium will look like during a match when West Ham take up their tenancy in time for the 2016/17 season\n\n\n\nFacelift: West Ham are turning the stadium into a 54,000-capacity football ground\n\n' Since we came to West Ham in 2010 we have had a vision to really take the club forward so West Ham United can compete on the pitch at the highest level.\n\n' Today's decision offers us a real platform to do this and we are fully committed to making it a real success.\n\n\n\n'We understand the responsibilities that come with calling the nation's iconic Olympic Stadium, which will be converted into a world-class football stadium, our new home. It is an honour we will take on with pride.'\n\nWest Ham will consult their fans before deciding whether to leave their famous Bobby Moore statue at Upton Park or take it with them to their new home.\n\n\n\nThe club are also entitled to name two of the stands at the stadium, and one will be named after Moore.\n\n\n\nLondon mayor Boris Johnson was at the announcement made near the stadium this morning, along with mayor of Newham Sir Robin Wales and LLDC chief executive Dennis Hone.\n\n'This is a truly momentous milestone for London's spectacular Olympic Stadium ensuring its credible and sustainable future,' Johnson, who is also chair of the LLDC, said.\n\n'Through this deal with West Ham United FC, we are defying the gloomsters who predicted this landmark would become a dusty relic.\n\n\n\n'With a series of world class entertainment and sporting fixtures already in the bag for Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, this iconic site is set to be the glittering centrepiece of ambitious regeneration plans for east London, which will capitalise on the Olympic investment into this area for the long term benefit of this city.'\n\n\n\nAs expected, it was confirmed that the LLDC will receive a windfall payment should West Ham's owners sell on the back of the move within 10 years.\n\nThe stadium itself will have retractable seats all around the pitch, which will allow the 2017 World Athletics Championships to take place as planned. In addition, the deal opens the way for the stadium to be used as a venue for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\nThe plans for the future of West Ham's current Upton Park home and the surrounding area remain confidential for the time being.\n\nKarren Brady, West Ham's vice-chairman , said: 'I\u2019m delighted that we have been confirmed today as the anchor concessionaire for the Olympic Stadium. I commend my two Chairmen for their passion and commitment. I am delighted this has been rewarded now that their ambition to see the Club they love enjoy a bright future at the iconic Olympic Stadium has been realised.\n\nHome from home: The future of West Ham's Boleyn Ground (left, otherwise known as Upton Park) is uncertain as they head for their new ground (right)\n\nRaring to go: (left-right) West Ham's Carlton Cole, Elliot Lee, Joe Cole, Kevin Nolan, Blair Turgott and James Tomkins pose in front of the club's new home\n\nNew signing? Mayor of London Boris Johnson joined the West Ham players at the Olympic Stadium on Friday morning - and showed off a personalised club shirt\n\n\n\nHOW WEST HAM ARE PAYING \u00a315m FOR A \u00a3500m STADIUM When will they move in? 2016 How long for? They have 99-year concession\n\nOriginal cost of stadium: \u00a3486million\n\nCost of transforming Olympic Stadium into venue suitable for football:\n\nWest Ham: \u00a315m\n\nNewham Council: \u00a340m\n\nGovernment: \u00a325m (additional support should it be required)\n\nHow revenues will be earned and shared:\n\nWest Ham will pay approximately \u00a32m a year for rent and share naming rights, catering and hospitality revenues. The club will solely earn money from anything generated directly from the football club, such as ticket sales and merchandise.\n\n\n\n'It was important to me that we struck a deal that would stand the test of time that represented the right deal for West Ham United and our loyal and patient supporters.\n\n\n\n'The consultation we have promised them will now begin and we can\u2019t wait to work with them to create a stunning new home that befits the pride, passion and tradition that the world associates with West Ham United.'\n\nLeyton Orient owner Barry Hearn has been against West Ham taking over as the sole football club at the stadium and has challenged the decision throughout the process.\n\nThe 64-year-old Matchroom Sport chairman told talkSPORT he did not understand the timing of the announcement.\n\n'I don't know why they are announcing anything because we have applied to the High Court for a judicial review of the bidding process, so anything they announce about West Ham has to be subject to the High Court's decision,' he said.\n\n\n\n'Why they are trying to steamroll this announcement through today, prior to the court's decision, to me is a sign of panic. I don't know why they are doing it.'\n\nHearn's main bone of contention is his feeling that a move for West Ham closer to the home of npower League One club Orient will ruin his club.\n\n'We don't think we have been given a fair crack of the whip,' he said. 'We have had no opportunity to discuss ground-sharing with West Ham, which we think is the only logical way out. What harm do we do? We get a chance to survive.'\n\nFormer sports minister Richard Caborn is also unhappy with the deal, branding it 'the biggest mistake of the London Olympics'.\n\nDeal done: Johnson with Brady and Sir Robin Wales, Mayor Of Newham (right) at the press conference to announce West Ham's tenancy agreement\n\nTime to say goodbye: The Hammers are set to increase their potential for match-day revenue by leaving the 35,000-capacity Upton Park\n\nWe've got a new home! West Ham are currently 14th in the Premier League table - a relatively comfortable six points above the relegation zone\n\n\n\nReaction on Twitter\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson: An historic day for East London - Future of Olympic Stadium secured with fantastic deal with @whu_official Deal with West Ham is just the beginning - perfect platform for Olympic legacy. Schools, jobs & growth at heart of regenerated East End.\n\n\n\nCarlton Cole: A Historic Day for West Ham United Caborn said that he welcomed the fact that the future of the stadium was now settled but insisted there has been unnecessary cost to the public purse.\n\nUnder the deal announced today, West Ham will pay only \u00a315million for a 99-year lease on a stadium whose conversion costs will be \u00a3150million to \u00a3190million and whose overall cost could top \u00a3630million. Caborn said: 'This is the biggest mistake of the Olympics and lessons should be learned from this.\n\n'West Ham are basically getting a stadium costing more than \u00a3600million for just \u00a315million and a small amount in annual rent [\u00a32million].\n\n'I do welcome the fact that the future of the stadium has finally been secured, but we should also realise that the public sector is picking up the tab.\n\n'The mistake was made in 2006/7 when they [the Olympic Board] ruled football out of a retro-fit design as we has done successfully in Manchester with the Commonwealth Games stadium. Fireworks: The Olympic Stadium has seen just a few weeks of competitive action, but they were nothing short of spectacular\n\n'I suggested retractable seating like the Stade de France in Paris but they insisted it should be a 25,000-seat athletics stadium.\n\n'Time and again mistakes are made with Olympic Stadiums and the lessons should be learned for any future similar projects.' Caborn was sports minister at the time the design of the Olympic Stadium was agreed but campaigned unsuccessfully for it to be built with football in mind for the future. The negotiations between the London Legacy Development Corporation and West Ham have been long and tortuous since the club was named preferred bidders in December, but they have now finally been signed off by the corporation\u2019s legal advisers.\n\nWhat a summer: The Olympic Stadium in Stratford was the centrepiece for London's glorious Games last year, but has been out of use ever since\n\n\n\nArtist's impression: West Ham had previously released this image of how the stadium would look during a match Under the agreement, West Ham will be given the right to use the stadium for all their matches under the 99-year concession deal. That will give the club long-term security but they will have no property interest in the stadium. The deal will protect public interest should West Ham\u2019s owners sell the club for a large profit on the back of the move to the stadium - the LLDC would get a significant cut of any surplus. Giant leap: Heptathlete Jessica Ennis (above) and shot-putter Robin Womack (below) during the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LLDC will have the rights to the income from other events such as music concerts and there will also be a legacy for athletics, with a number of events for that sport maintained.\n\nThe retractable seating should allow the stadium to be changed from a football venue - with seats on the running track - to one suitable for athletics or concerts within eight days and potentially even quicker.\n\nThe revamp of the stadium will cost \u00a3150million and the Hammers are expected to be there for the start of the 2016-17 season.\n\nP.S. It's not all good news for Hammers fans...\n\nWhile the Olympic Stadium plans will no doubt thrill the majority of West Ham supporters, it looks like the club's future might not be quite so exciting after all.\n\nJudging by the club's impressions of how the team will look in action at their new home, there's bad news for fans hoping for a few star signings to fill their magnificent ground.\n\nLook closely and West Ham's team for 2016 still appears to contain Carlton Cole and Matt Taylor...", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-0D20F030000005DC-686_964x471.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-0131DE4400000578-795_964x632.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DCAA33000005DC-213_964x591.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DBA22A000005DC-531_472x553.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DC923E000005DC-284_964x582.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/20/article-2296353-0D2372D2000005DC-508_87x84.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/facebook/DailyMailSport/DailyMailSport.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/icon_comments_74.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DC91C0000005DC-681_964x626.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DB8548000005DC-994_1024x615_large.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-14C8CA92000005DC-74_964x639.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DC0E53000005DC-624_964x291.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DC914E000005DC-673_964x535.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/21/article-2297042-14BE7DB8000005DC-307_87x84.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DB8548000005DC-592_470x423.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-0E52FD3400000578-838_964x621.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DB8548000005DC-631_964x511.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DC8B59000005DC-440_964x599.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/20/article-2296660-18CDD693000005DC-23_87x84.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DC8CBA000005DC-637_964x617.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-1460FB9C000005DC-732_964x600.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/btn_add-your-comment.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-166582A2000005DC-862_964x623.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-16AA7360000005DC-486_964x536.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DB8548000005DC-424_470x423.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-170BCEED000005DC-694_964x765.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/misc/logo_cookie_reg.png"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297419-18DB8548000005DC-994_1024x615_large.jpg", "date": "22/03/2013"}, "rank_219": {"title": "West Ham Olympic Stadium where's my share? Des Kelly", "text": "British taxpayers have just handed West Ham a stadium worth half a billion pounds... where's my bit of this \u00a3630m council house?\n\nDear West Ham\n\nCould you please send me the part of the Olympic stadium that I now own? It seems the Government has given you millions of pounds of public money and, as a result, I have bought a piece of your new arena. I\u2019d like that back, thank you.\n\nCan you believe it? British taxpayers have just handed a Premier League football club a stadium worth half a billion pounds which, in these austere times, you might think is charity enough.\n\nBut not content with that almighty handout, the Government is throwing another \u00a325million of public money in their direction to ensure the interior fittings, including new seats and a roof, are to their liking when they move into their gigantic new council house.\n\nNew home: An artist's impression of how the Olympic Stadium will look when West Ham move in\n\nAt the end of the process, West Ham will receive more than \u00a3630m of real estate with huge commercial potential and donate only \u00a315m and \u00a32m a year in rent for the privilege.\n\nNow read those numbers again and tell me if you ever expect to understand the world of economics? I\u2019m not sure I do but I know when I\u2019m being ripped off.\n\nThey are getting the keys for less than it would cost to buy an average left-back. Worse still, they moaned about handing over even this meagre amount.\n\nIf West Ham wanted to put in retractable seats and modify the original design they should have paid for the changes themselves. Boris Johnson and Co had done enough for the Hammers to accept the stadium as it was, even with its flaws.\n\nBut Mayor Boris has buffooned his way through this whole process. Terrified he might be left with a \u2018white elephant\u2019, he caved in to every whim and moan. Friday\u2019s press conference was so obsequious, I half expected him to unveil the new centre-forward the taxpayer had bought for the club.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a deal people said could never be done,\u2019 he jabbered. No they didn\u2019t. They just hoped it wouldn\u2019t be done quite like this.\n\nIt is excellent the stadium is being utilised, yet the terms are laughable. Let me put West Ham\u2019s contribution in context. They could conceivably recoup their \u00a32m rent within three or four home games with a capacity of 54,000.\n\nIt also grates to hear they made a song and dance about stumping up \u00a315m towards the revamp when West Ham handed out cheques worth \u00a34.4m to football agents last season alone.\n\nThe vice-chairman of West Ham, Karren Brady, declared: \u2018We accept the cost of making this into a world-class stadium has come from the Government, but we hope over 99 years we can pay that back.\u2019\n\nMan of the people: Boris Johnson made the announcement that West Ham would take over the stadium\n\nBy the way...\n\nIt is something of an irony that the performances of the Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart have been flakier since he started advertising an anti-dandruff shampoo.\n\nI\u2019m not sure the British taxpayer is going to be won over by a polite \u2018thank you for the stadium\u2019 card accompanied by an IOU for \u00a3600m dated a century from now, but you could only admire the cheek.\n\nNo word as yet, either, on what will happen to West Ham\u2019s current Upton Park home when they move to Stratford? If it is sold off, does the money go back to the Treasury? Let us hope so. But experience suggests it might not be an idea to hold your breath, not even for a hundred years.\n\nLet us hope this is not our Olympic legacy. The country is nigh on broke. Hospitals are being closed, schools cannot afford books and soldiers are sent into combat with weaponry that is about as useful as a mop, should anything as inconvenient as actual fighting break out. Yet a member of one of the most lucrative sporting institutions in the world is effectively receiving a huge benefit handout from the State.\n\nThe Premier League is awash with cash. The new television deals are worth upwards of \u00a35.5 billion over three years and that windfall will be shared between just 20 clubs. Even the bottom club will pick up \u00a360m merely for turning up for one season.\n\nThe Premier League\u2019s revenue last year \u2014 give or take a prawn sandwich \u2014 was \u00a31,286,000,000.00. I\u2019ve included the row of noughts because it\u2019s easy to talk about a million here and a billion there without realising the true scale of the numbers involved.\n\nFireworks: The Olympic Stadium has seen just a few weeks of competitive action, but they were spectacular\n\nThis is big money. Contrast it with headlines in the newspapers warning half-a-million families were losing childcare vouchers, gas bills were going up 15 per cent and tax rises could be on the way unless someone hits George Osborne around the head with that red briefcase.\n\nLet me bring it closer to home and ask you a question. How do you plan to finance your pension portfolio? Is the answer...\n\na) My what?\n\nb) With a winner at Newbury today.\n\nc) By selling a kidney.\n\nMany people are skint and resentful. The economic pinch has turned into something more bruising.\n\n\n\nAnd with perfect timing, Danny Boyle, the man behind the spectacular London 2012 opening ceremony, suggested the Olympic spirit had been killed by the recession. Killed? It was more a contract assassination. Then a few million more was slapped on the table to try to dispose of the body as quietly as possible.\n\nSo a football club owned by two multi-millionaires not only picked up a stadium for next to nothing, but also persuaded others to make it even more profitable for them.\n\nRaring to go: West Ham's Carlton Cole, Elliot Lee, Joe Cole, Kevin Nolan, Blair Turgott and James Tomkins\n\nThis is a fine deal for West Ham, but not for the people of Sheffield, who saw their Don Valley athletics stadium close this month. Or for little Leyton Orient, who fear going bust with this tax-funded goliath on their doorstep. Or for supporters across the country sitting in their own decrepit grandstands. They all paid for this new ground, though.\n\nSo well done to David Gold and David Sullivan, men who originally built their fortunes on profits made from the pornographic industry. I\u2019d say they pulled it off, but it might be misconstrued. At least they should be able to count the cash from here on in.\n\nI just wonder what their next money-spinning product might be? My suggestion is a film entitled The Great British Taxpayer \u2014 Shafted!\n\nWhen Dave was a lad\n\nThe media industry is always on the look out for engaging football pundits. It\u2019s not even essential to be right, since being loudly wrong is often more lucrative.\n\nProfessional frown collector and Darth Maul impersonator, Roy Keane, demonstrated this when he was praised for being completely mistaken about the infamous Nani red card against Real Madrid.\n\nEven as he fixed everyone around him with his serial killer stare and dared them to disagree, the reaction was gratitude that a former player had offered up a thought that was genuinely controversial.\n\nIn a similar style, another \u2018brave\u2019 voice appeared in the sporting firmament this week, lighting up the landscape with his incendiary and startlingly incorrect view.\n\nDave Whelan, the Wigan Athletic chairman, reviewed a video of Callum McManaman\u2019s tackle on Newcastle\u2019s Massadio Haidara that was part kung-fu assault, part DIY amputation attempt and announced: \u2018He won the ball clean as a whistle\u2019.\n\nWhat were you watching? Dave Whelan (centre) claimed Callum McManaman won the ball (below)\n\nEven allowing for the customary bias in football, it\u2019s an alarming remark.\n\nBut I already have a title for his new column \u2014 \u2018Whelan\u2019s Ye Olde World\u2019 \u2014 where Dave gives his view on global events through clouded irises of misplaced nostalgia. Imagine the knowledge he could dispense?\n\n\n\nWhelan on technology: \u2018In my day there were none of those fancy gadgets youngsters have now. We couldn\u2019t afford a washing machine. Or rocks. We cleaned our clothes in the canal by pounding them with our heads\u2019.\n\nWhelan on the Palestine/Israel conflict: \u2018They should just shake hands. It\u2019s a fuss about nothing, for heaven\u2019s sake. We didn\u2019t have any of that religion in my day, I swear to God.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhelan on Global Warming: \u2018We\u2019d have been glad of it. In my day we didn\u2019t have central heating. Or foreigners. It was never a problem when the Sun went round the Earth.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhelan is 76.\n\nHodgson\u2019s Rio recall was never going to take off\n\nEvery time I fly first class on an aircraft, I experience all sorts of pain. It\u2019s usually earache \u2014 after the accounts department receive the invoice and ground me for the foreseeable future.\n\nThere are also other perils. Sometimes the \u2018hot towels\u2019 are lukewarm. The Puligny-Montrachet is too chilled to draw out its sophisticated mineral tones. And economy passengers use the first-class toilets, which is a sign that the fabric of social order is tearing apart. Or so I\u2019m told, easyJet doesn\u2019t have first class.\n\nJet set: Rio Ferdinand travelled to Qatar to appear as a pundit for England's match with San Marino\n\nRio Ferdinand\u2019s luxury round trip to the Middle East to engage in \u2018Wazza-will-be-disappointed-with-that\u2019 television punditry on Friday night was never likely to be a travel ordeal of Ranulph Fiennes proportions. This did not stop one broadcaster wheeling out a physiotherapist with her model of a spine to inform us Ferdinand\u2019s back would not collapse like a tower of Jenga blocks as it was \u2018unlikely he would be sitting in economy\u2019.\n\nSuch insight.\n\nBut after noting Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s obvious surprise at Ferdinand\u2019s inclusion in the squad, I warned last week: \u2018Now we\u2019ll find out how much Rio really wants to play for his country.\u2019\n\n\n\nIt turned out to be not that much.\n\nFerdinand is approaching the end of his career and is unable to perform regularly without intensive help. Add that he is unlikely to figure in the 2014 World Cup finals squad after another 15 months of football \u2014 assuming England make it \u2014 and he withdrew from the last World Cup Finals because of the same injury, and it\u2019s no shock.\n\n\n\nBlow: Roy Hodgson had called Ferdinand into his squad for the crucial World Cup qualifiers\n\nHis back is not going to be better four years on from South Africa, is it? Remember too, he has not been picked by England for two years, has heard manager Roy Hodgson declare his career was over, was overlooked for John Terry in dubious circumstances and was drafted back this time due to injuries to others.\n\nHow much did Ferdinand want to play for England? Not as much as he wants to secure a new contract with Manchester United.\n\nBut while heading to Qatar this weekend was probably a deliberate two fingers to Hodgson, it was hamfisted of the England coach to recall the defender without making the common sense move to sound out the state of his mind and body beforehand.\n\n\n\n", "images":

"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/22/article-2297795-18DC8CBA000005DC-894_1024x615_large.jpg", "date": "22/03/2013"}, "rank_167": {"title": "Martin Samuel: West Ham moving to the Olympic Stadium is the ONLY option aside from a bulldozer", "text": "West Ham are the ONLY option for the Olympic Stadium this side of a bulldozer\n\nBuildings are like people. Without care, they get sick. You wouldn\u2019t recognise London\u2019s Olympic Stadium now. It is brand new but, in its own way, derelict. After September 9, when the Paralympics ended, the folk from LOCOG moved through like a retreating Soviet army. Everything of use or worth that wasn\u2019t nailed down, and some things that were, disappeared. Carpet tiles, wallpaper, lights. A recent visitor said one of the offices still had a plant in the corner, but it was dead.\n\nYet the electric remains on, security men still patrol, and the rates and overheads need to be met, as always. The seats, which are filthy and have a nasty film developing on them, will need to be thoroughly cleaned before the IAAF Diamond League visit in July.\n\n\n\nUse it or knock it down: The Olympic Stadium is an unnecessary drain on resources in its current state and letting West Ham (below) play there is the only viable solution\n\nUnused stadiums are expensive. The new Wembley Stadium was not constructed using any of the material from its predecessor, because that was reduced to rubble in 2003. By then, it had lain empty for three years, at a cost of \u00a32million per month in staff, lost revenue, plus the steady drain of keeping teams of lawyers and architects on retainers for re-launch day. To refurbish the old stadium after just three years empty would have cost \u00a3200m.\n\nSo there is the alternative. We can keep the Olympic Stadium as it is, rotting from the inside with costs rising exponentially, or we can move on. All the bleating about the tenancy of West Ham United ignores one simple fact. In the last year, any man with a plan could have bid for the Olympic Stadium. You, me, UK Athletics, Leyton Orient, Simon Cowell \u2014 the entire country could have had a crack at getting it working again. And at the end of that process, a Premier League football club was still the only viable game in town.\n\n\n\nNow ignore the carping and think what would have happened had West Ham walked away. What would be the future? A Formula One track for a race that doesn\u2019t exist? The location of a university that nobody has heard of? Home to a football club that fills, on average, 3,867 seats? West Ham were the only option this side of a bulldozer.\n\n\n\nIt was considered better value to knock down the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield than let it continue as a declining sports facility. The Olympic Stadium could have eventually gone the same way.\n\n\n\nWho owns it now? You do. For another 99 years at least. It doesn\u2019t belong to West Ham, any more than a council tenant owns his flat.\n\n\n\nThe stadium is public property and the football club will rent. Others will join. Individual concert promoters, the organisers of the Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n\nWest Ham are only anchor tenants. So you haven\u2019t been stiffed, ripped off or deprived of legacy. Those left to sweep up after a very expensive mistake made the best of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nStark reality: The Olympic Stadium could be used and decked out in claret and blue (above) or the builders could move in\n\nLord Coe, Ken Livingstone and Tessa Jowell were the architects of this 80,000-capacity cock-up, and are lucky the rebound is not greater. Their refusal to even entertain a post-Olympic football option was so pig-headed that David Bernstein, who as the chairman of Manchester City and later of Wembley Stadium Limited, had overseen two huge and recent arena projects, did not receive a single call to seek his advice or experience. Football was to play no part in the Olympic legacy. Realism had no chance against well-honed prejudices.\n\n\n\nRemove West Ham this morning and what would the nation actually own? An unlovely concrete bowl, minus a roof, in a part of London that gentrification forgot.\n\n\n\nA non-starter as a winter venue, unappealing even in the English summer, it would now sit empty at vast maintenance cost, becoming more obsolete with each passing year.\n\n\n\nSo whatever deal West Ham are getting, it is better than plan B.\n\n\n\nDriving a hard bargain: Karren Brady (right), alongside West Ham co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold\n\nThat is why Karren Brady, who masterminded the project for the club, could afford to drive a hard bargain. The only option was to find new life and West Ham stood for life. Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire, sang The Beatles \u2014 and one giant financial black chasm wherever an Olympic stadium rises without a post-Games anchor tenant. The Bird\u2019s Nest in Beijing is now a Segway race track.\n\n\n\nSo forget this falsehood that the people owned a thriving stadium. The Olympics ended six months ago. The country was left with an empty, unused, relic off an A12 flyover, which would in time have served only as a reminder of another opportunity lost by our sporting and political leaders.\n\n\n\nThey are the guilty parties here. West Ham merely cleaned up their mess.\n\n\n\nTon-up Ramos shows the way\n\nIt was not the finest day for Spanish football but last week\u2019s 1-1 with draw with Finland was notable for being the 100th international appearance of Sergio Ramos. He is 26.\n\n\n\nIsn\u2019t it strange that the elite clubs in Europe rarely seem to have a problem with their players representing their national teams? Why should Real Madrid and Manchester United be so different?\n\n\n\nTon-derful: Sergio Ramos scored on the occasion of his 100th cap for Spain. He is just 26\n\nSepp sticks it to Platini\n\nSepp Blatter is in the form of his life. Following his condemnation of the travelling circus that will be the 2020 European Championship finals, his appraisal of the growing crisis around the Qatar World Cup is spot on, too.\n\n\n\nBlatter points out that if the tournament moves to the winter, it is no longer the event that was agreed at that notorious FIFA meeting on December 2, 2010, and those defeated by Qatar \u2014 Australia, the United States, South Korea and Japan \u2014 would have legitimate legal reasons to demand a re-vote.\n\n\n\nAs the campaign to shift Qatar\u2019s goalposts gathers momentum, it is almost as if Blatter is looking to create complications for that nice Mr Platini, the man who would be his successor. Oh, surely not.\n\n\n\nThe FA always find a place to hide\n\n\n\nRichard Scudamore, the Premier League\u2019s chief executive, is correct in saying there is provision in the rules for the Football Association to review an extraordinary incident, such as Callum McManaman\u2019s tackle on Massadio Haidara.\n\n\n\nIt has happened in the past, when overturning decisions.\n\n\n\nMike Dean, by all accounts, did not agree to rescind Vincent Kompany\u2019s red card against Arsenal earlier in the season. He saw the incident and punished the Manchester City captain as he saw fit. The FA, not the referee, made the change. How is this different? It isn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nA fine mess: Callum McManaman's tackle on Massadio Haidara has gone unpunished by the authorities\n\nThe FA hides behind an official having seen the incident in the case of McManaman but, even if he has, it can be claimed in an exceptional reading of the rules that he saw it, but without realising the full extent, so his judgement is worthless.\n\n\n\nStill, Wilfried Zaha of Crystal Palace got a one-match ban for showing the finger to some Leeds United fans who were giving him a hard time, so it can never be said that the FA isn\u2019t tackling the big issues.\n\n\n\nNot me boss: Luis Suarez has pleaded the 'mistranslated' defence after quotes attributed to him in his homeland about his Liverpool future\n\nLuis Suarez returned to Uruguay and gave an interview in which he invited offers from clubs in the Champions League. He then just as swiftly retracted those comments, claiming he had been misquoted or mistranslated. You have heard this one before.\n\n\n\nIt is a standard preliminary tactic in the long, drawn-out summer transfer saga. Come and get me, ooh, no don\u2019t, because I never said that and, anyway, I\u2019m happy where I am. For now. As long as the club continues to match my ambitions. But obviously I\u2019m very flattered to be linked with (insert name of major Champions League contender here). It is important to test myself against the best in the world.\n\n\n\nAnd on it will go. Some of you know the words by heart now, fans of Arsenal in particular. And it does not end here.\n\n\n\nThere will be more confusion, more mixed messages, and probably a resolution around August.\n\n\n\nConsider no version of events definitive until then. Liverpool must simply hope that whatever is about to unfold allows them time to make proper preparations for next season. They can ill afford another panicked, hasty resolution, or a second Andy Carroll.\n\n\n\nAND WHILE WE'RE AT IT\n\nThe full extent of the damage done to British wrestling by the discredited regime of former performance director Shaun Morley \u2014 who allowed the programme to become flooded with East European imports \u2014 is now becoming clear.\n\n\n\nWrestling lost its UK Sport grant after the fiasco that ended with just one British competitor at the 2012 London Olympics, Ukrainian Olga Butkevych, who says she is now working as a hairdresser to make ends meet.\n\n\n\n\u2018I have no coach and no sparring partners,\u2019 she reveals. \u2018I finish work at 5pm and train at 5.30pm every day. I\u2019m on my feet all the time, I don\u2019t have proper food, or proper rest. It\u2019s not professional.\u2019\n\n\n\nWrestle-maniacs: Britain's Olga Butkevych (in red) is now working as a hairdresser to earn a living\n\nWhy should we have sympathy for Butkevych? She made an opportunist move that backfired. Yet undoubtedly, the imported athletes were sold a scheme by wrestling\u2019s hierarchy, who are every bit as guilty of attempting to manipulate the system.\n\n\n\nMaybe we should simply end the athletes\u2019 pretence of belonging to Britain and allow Butkevych to return to her own country and continue her career with an adequate support network.\n\n\n\nUnless sweeping up split ends in Manchester is genuinely preferable to being a full-time wrestler in Zaporizhia, Ukraine: which would explain her career path.\n\n\n\nRio's on the outside\n\nTerry Venables said the England team should be as hard to get out of as it was to get into.\n\n\n\nHe meant that to achieve the much-sought club spirit that all international managers desire, there had to be some loyalty to the group.\n\n\n\nThat does not mean a player can\u2019t be dropped, but that once inside the circle, he will have to show a dramatic deterioration in form or commitment to be rejected.\n\n\n\nVenables refused to ditch Alan Shearer throughout a desperately barren run in the build-up to the 1996 European Championship.\n\nHe was rewarded by having the top goalscorer at the tournament. Rio Ferdinand is confident that Roy Hodgson bears no grudge over his withdrawal from international duty, but they last spoke before his working holiday in Qatar. Things change.\n\nTaking a break: Rio Ferdinand has been in Qatar while England take on San Marino and Montenegro\n\nHad Ferdinand turned up, he would be inside now. As it is, he did not get so much as a foot through the door and Hodgson will better remember the commitment of his contemporaries.\n\n\n\nIf he feels as Venables did, he will find it harder to drop Chris Smalling than pick Ferdinand.\n\nAn increase in the Premier League\u2019s parachute payments to relegated clubs has caused outrage among their Football League rivals.\n\n\n\nThe disparity between the \u00a323m given to those falling out of the Premier League, and the \u00a32.3m received by the other 21 Championship teams is clearly a problem.\n\n\n\nThe cost of maintaining a Premier League squad, and trying to survive amid such wealth, however, means a substantial cut could send a relegated club into freefall - or make the newly-promoted so cautious that they would be unable to participate with even a hope of staying up.\n\n\n\nChin up, chaps: Premier League parachute payments are causing concern among Football League clubs\n\nThe Premier League is under attack over this new plan, with many saying the Football League\u2019s financial fair play regulations are incompatible with such a bonus. It is therefore the restrictions, not the insurance, that are harming the playing field.\n\n\n\nThe clubs voted to be bound by red tape. They must have realised there would be consequences, that parachute payments would then leave some with more to spend. The way out is to let clubs manage their financial destiny sensibly without being governed to death, not to condemn three to a vicious cycle of boom and bust.\n\n\n\nHaving sat through the dullest and most predictable England international in recent memory, the news that Gibraltar\u2019s campaign to become the 54th member of UEFA is gathering steam is a fresh source of delight.\n\n\n\nGibraltar competed in the 2014 UEFA Futsal EURO, finishing third of four in their preliminary qualifying group in January. UEFA will now consider their full membership on May 24.\n\n\n\nIt strengthens the claim of increasing prowess that, despite losing their first two games at UEFA\u2019s Futsal tournament by an aggregate of 16-4, Gibraltar rallied to win their next 7-5. Although it was against San Marino.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

Don't whinge, just enjoy those golden memories - MARTIN SAMUEL", "text": "Don't whinge about an Olympic legacy... just enjoy those golden memories\n\n\n\nIn the weeks after the 9/11 attacks, as American patriotism and anger twisted into a more self-serving emotion, a satirical newspaper, The Onion, captured the mood of a nation. On November 7, 2001, it published a parody of a thundering editorial beneath a headline that read: If I Don\u2019t Get My Medium-Rare Shell Steak With Roasted Vegetables In The Next 10 Minutes, The Terrorists Have Already Won.\n\nThe terrorists have won was a well-worn phrase at the time. It still is. Delayed at the airport? The terrorists have won. Human rights laws upheld in court? The terrorists have won. And since September last year, in Britain we have enjoyed our equivalent. You hear it every day now. There is no Olympic legacy.\n\nThe local judo club shuts. There is no Olympic legacy. The Government doesn\u2019t want to subsidise handball. There is no Olympic legacy. Women\u2019s football not on Match of the Day? There is no Olympic legacy. The stadium goes to a Premier League club. There is no Olympic legacy. The post is late, the recyclers have ignored your wheelie bin and you\u2019ve been going nowhere with a call centre for two hours over the gas bill. That\u2019s it \u2014 there is no Olympic legacy.\n\nThe word on everyone's lips: West Ham's tenancy of the Olympic Stadium has got people talking about legacy\n\nEverywhere you look there is no legacy these days. If anything, the true legacy is moaning about the absence of a legacy. Yet what did we expect? Were we really so shallow or foolish that we thought a few weeks of high-class sporting activity one summer was going to alter the ramifications of a serious economic crisis for the ordinary citizen?\n\nWe cannot afford some of the grass-roots activities that were previously taken for granted because we spent roughly nine billion quid on a jolly-up, remember? The Olympics were that holiday we couldn\u2019t really afford. It was nice while it lasted, and everyone had a lovely time, and there is a part of us that will always have fond memories, and God we needed it back then, but now the bill has landed and it means we cannot afford some of the essentials, and we\u2019re just going to have to suck that up.\n\nThere is no Olympic legacy? Yes there is but you\u2019ve got to be lucky. Old Loughtonians Hockey Club in Essex has two fantastic new Smurf turf pitches because their ground in Luxborough Lane was used as an Olympic training facility. So local schoolchildren and club members now get to play every week on an Olympic standard surface, which is marvellous.\n\n\n\nAnd the benefit to other hockey clubs? Well, not so much. Those involved in the Schools Sports Partnership, for instance, may have missed out in the cuts because Olympic spending is random.\n\n\u2018Some people got lost in the flood, some people got away all right,\u2019 sings Randy Newman in Louisiana 1927. Olympic spending is like that.\n\n\n\nIf you live in Newham you now have a state-of-the-art swimming pool for use on school gala days. If you live in Newcastle, the main city pool is shutting due to lack of funds. That is what nine billion pounds of public money concentrated disproportionately on one area does. Still, it\u2019s about time the Government focused on London. Our nation\u2019s capital city has been ignored too long, as anyone living in Gateshead will testify.\n\nOn the very concept of legacy, people were sold a pup. It was as if sport was just something that would happen to you, as a result of watching the Olympics. It was never going to be like that. You would still have to go out in the cold and run. It would still require commitment, and expense, and it would still hurt if you did it properly.\n\n\n\nThere was never going to be a wand that took the effort, or the basic desire, out of sport and fitness. And there is scant correlation between watching a person do something well on television and getting off the sofa to do it yourself. That is why we have 24 hours of cooking programmes and Delia Smith needs to instruct the nation on how to boil water.\n\n\n\nWhat a summer: Memories of Mo Farah, Usain Bolt and Jessica Ennis (below) will live with us forever\n\nSeeing Mo Farah run 5,000 metres is considerably less strenuous than running it yourself; particularly in an English winter. And you liked handball? You want to join a handball team? Well, you can\u2019t, because it is not a British sport, so the few clubs that are around are full of very serious handball players who don\u2019t want to be saddled with a couple of mugs who don\u2019t even know the rules, and may pack it in when the novelty wears off.\n\n\n\nPlus, minority sport is rarely publicly funded, so handball clubs do not have the financial clout to set up the coaching programmes required to create a major participation sport. That goes for a lot of Olympic activities. Then there is the expense of, say, archery, fencing or equestrianism. All of it requires equipment, time, dedication and often talent, and all of it costs.\n\nSo our Olympic legacy was never going to be about firing up the nation to be skilled with an epee, it was about motivating an interest in health and getting people jogging, or gardening, or playing badminton or walking the dog. All of which could have been done anyway without needing nine billion quid to be spent on one project.\n\n\n\nShow time: Danny Boyle gave us a glittering Opening Ceremony, but it was glossy - and expensive - fantasy\n\nIndeed, it might be argued that nine billion invested in sport countrywide would have been, quite literally, healthier. In Wigan, free swimming for those under 16 and over 65 has been withdrawn. It saves \u00a3106,000.\n\nA drop in the deep end of our Olympic budget, but not for Chris Ready, Wigan council\u2019s portfolio holder for leisure. He is not destroying our legacy, though; he is merely trying to safeguard what remains of it in impossible circumstances.\n\nThe closure of Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield has been widely publicised. Less discussed nationally, but a more controversial decision locally, is the possible demise of the Stocksbridge Leisure Centre, which needs external funds to replace a \u00a3400,000 government subsidy.\n\n\n\nThe mountain biking facility for London 2012 came in at \u00a35m and was in use for roughly six hours, including medal ceremonies, money that would have kept Stocksbridge going for 12-and-a-half years. Legacy is such a vague word. What we are dealing with here is maths, and economics.\n\nAllan Leighton (right) has emerged as a contender for the job of Premier League chairman.\n\nHe is the former head of Asda and the Royal Mail, but is best known in football for his time as deputy chairman of Leeds United.\n\nConsidering this was the period in which Peter Ridsdale almost steered the club off a cliff, not exactly a safe pair of hands, was he?\n\nRemember when? Peter Ridsdale with Rio Ferdinand (above) and Leeds fans protest against him in 2003\n\n\n\nSo there is a lot of begrudging. Indeed, our expectations of this mythical bequest to the nation \u2014 like that juicy steak that was so cruelly undermined by terrorists \u2014 has unrealistically moved beyond the confines of sport.\n\nDanny Boyle, organiser of the Opening Ceremony, talked of the whole spirit of the Games being lost, even though he admitted with the next breath it was never feasible that it could be maintained. Our hopes were unreasonably high. Boyle did a brilliant job of selling Britain to the world, but the budget for his Games opener was twice that of his new film, Trance. We could not continue to live that way.\n\nFar from dancing nurses, we are having to introduce political initiatives to teach the youngest nursing graduates how to wash patients. That is brutal reality versus glossy fantasy. Life was never going to unfold to a banging soundtrack by Underworld and a succession of uplifting highs.\n\nThere was always going to be a day of reckoning. A day when everyone had to go to work, without the fillip of gold medals or plucky Paralympians. It does not mean there is no Olympic legacy. It just means life cannot be one long water cooler moment.\n\nA few did highlight our disconnection from consequence at the time. They were called whingers, and worse, once the Olympics were successfully under way. How wrong you were, the cheerleaders crowed. Our Olympics are wonderful. Well, yes, they were always going to be, because the British people are great at street parties. And then, when the bunting was taken down, boy was there going to be a hangover from this one.\n\n\n\nAnd as no global economy has ever been beach volleyballed into buoyancy, it has transpired that spending nine billion quid on an elite festival and keeping every swimming pool, running track and council gym open in the face of dramatic financial austerity are incompatible ideals.\n\n\n\nSo stop whingeing about legacy. You knew this. You were warned. You wanted the party, you wanted the holiday, you wanted fun, fun, fun till her daddy takes the T-bird away. And you got it. Your golden memories are the legacy. Now pick up a shovel there\u2019s work to be done.\n\nTime to give it a rest, Arsene\n\nArsene Wenger wants to meet Roy Hodgson to discuss Jack Wilshere\u2019s schedule for the rest of the season. Wenger has already expressed concern that Wilshere\u2019s 90 minutes against Brazil in February contributed to his current injury problems.\n\nIsn\u2019t it strange how his two games for England seem to be so debilitating, but not his 26 for Arsenal?\n\nNot so different, is it? Midfield playmeker Jack Wilshere in action for Arsenal (left) and England (right)\n\n\n\nAnd while we\u2019re at it...\n\nDave Whelan, chairman of Wigan Athletic, has attracted much criticism for his defence of Callum McManaman, and that is unsurprising.\n\n\n\nHowever deluded he may be on that issue no Premier League owner would better deserve to lead his team out at Wembley when Wigan play Millwall in their FA Cup semi-final on April 13.\n\n\n\nWhelan has built, and maintained, a football club and continues to appoint impressive managers and give them time to mould a team. We need more like him and his misguided defence of a young player should not obscure that.\n\nRichard Bevan, chief executive of the League Managers\u2019 Association, made a valid point about the poor treatment of his members by chairmen this season.\n\n\n\nHe just picked the wrong example. Blackburn Rovers is a basket case club, but the injustice of Michael Appleton\u2019s dismissal would resonate more keenly had he not previously quit on Blackpool after 65 days.\n\nThe only way is up if Moyes moves on\n\nDavid Moyes has been linked to Sunderland if Martin O\u2019Neill leaves at the end of the season. Now why on earth would he want that? The frustration for Moyes is surely the glass ceiling that limits those clubs beneath the Champions League elite. He can only go so far at Everton. Yet if anything, as O\u2019Neill is discovering, at Sunderland it is worse.\n\n\n\nOn the day O\u2019Neill was appointed, it was stated that Sunderland\u2019s ambition was to become a top 10 club. Instantly, it seemed limiting for a manager of his ability. Who cares who comes 10th \u2014 or ninth, eighth or seventh for that matter? The problem for Moyes is that he does good work, without glory. Unless there is a dramatic injection of funds \u2014 which is not allowed now anyway \u2014 what would be different at Sunderland?\n\nOut of their league: There would be no sense in David Moyes (right) leaving Everton for Sunderland\n\nThe suggestion that Fernando Torres could be part of Chelsea\u2019s deal for Radamel Falcao at the end of the season is a logical one.\n\n\n\nAtletico Madrid is Torres\u2019s spiritual home and he would be welcomed back like a hero, which his confidence needs. Chelsea, in turn, would get the goalscorer they require to rebuild for next season.\n\nEveryone would be happy \u2014 and who thought that of Torres\u2019s inevitable departure from Stamford Bridge?\n\nTrading places? A deal seeing Radamel Falcao (left) and Fernando Torres (right) swapping sides is plausible\n\n\n\nDimitri Seluk, agent for Yaya Toure, attempted to bounce Manchester City into a hurried new deal for his player. It seems strange in these instances that the clubs do not respond by targeting the fractious middleman.\n\n\n\nWhy should they deal with Seluk after his outbursts?\n\n\n\nIf Toure wants a new deal at City, it could be politely explained that the only way it happens is if he finds a less outspoken representative.\n\nSeluk would certainly be steering Toure away from Manchester City, if the club spoke about him in such extreme terms.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/03/26/article-2299657-144129CA000005DC-434_634x414.jpg",

Olympic Stadium from the idiots who built it, no wonder Karren Brady is smiling", "text": "West Ham saved the Olympic Stadium from the idiots who built it, no wonder Karren has a big smile on her face\n\n\n\nShould West Ham United have the Olympic Stadium? If not, what alternative is there beyond bulldozers.\n\n\n\nThe column that started this week\u2019s barney is over there on the right.\n\n\n\nThe debate starts here.\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\n\n\n\n\nKnock it down as it is becoming a sponge for corruption at the expense of the working class tax payer. Kido 44, Birmingham\n\nI think you\u2019ll find the working-class tax payer, the middle-class tax payers, indeed all tax payers have already paid for it. We can write it off as the most expensive summer ball in history, or try to get some of the money back, but over time. Also, I\u2019d leave you to break the news of your grand post-Olympic plan to Jessica Ennis. 'Hi Jess, Kido here. Thanks for all the hard work and I thought I\u2019d keep you in the picture about what is happening next. You know that stadium where you trained to win your gold medal, the one in Don Valley? Yes? Good. Well, we\u2019re knocking it down. Yes, I thought you\u2019d like that. And the other place, where you actually won your gold medal? Well, we\u2019re knocking that down, too! Just in case you were wondering about legacy. Now, can I put you down for three tons of souvenir rubble? Lovely.'\n\nCome on Boris, you're losing her. Say something funny, man....\n\nThat's better, we knew you had it in you, you silver-tongued devil you\n\nYes, the Olympic Stadium has to be used, but the taxpayer shouldn't be subsidising a wealthy Premier League club. It gives West Ham United an unfair advantage. Ferdinand, London\n\nNo more so than the compulsory purchase orders around Highbury and the Emirates Stadium that benefited Arsenal. Businesses were evicted so a football club could build flats. Tottenham Hotspur also cut a good deal with Haringey council. Big business often gets a break this way. The argument runs that building projects by football clubs are a source of local employment and of revenue for the area. Without doubt more money will come into Stratford with West Ham there, than if we knocked the site flat for houses or business parks that in the current economic climate would stay largely empty.\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nThe unholy trinity of David Sullivan, Karren Brady and David Gold always want something for nothing. They are never happy. They are perpetually miserable. It is their default response. They achieved nothing at Birmingham City. Now they have a brand new stadium. It should be a cathedral of football for West Ham but their miserable, top of the shelf sleazy magazine mindset will turn it into the sporting equivalent of a \u00a31 shop. Poor old Sam Allardyce is on borrowed time. His thanks for all of his hard work and effort will be the chop at the end of the season. A more interesting article would have explored all of Lord Coe's Pinocchio tales of Olympic legacy. It is time that he was held to account for his empty promises. Nearly one year on, it is the asset strippers who are reaping the rewards. Kismet1001, London\n\nI don\u2019t think the owners of West Ham are asset-stripping the stadium, or the club. The opposite, in fact, considering the level of personal investment required to prop it up after the Icelandic banking disaster. They all looked pretty happy in the photographs to me, too. And we can certainly see how Birmingham City have thrived in their absence. It is not West Ham\u2019s fault that the idiots who oversaw the project made such poor preparation for its post Games legacy. With better planning they would have had the upper hand in negotiations and would be considering several viable suitors. As it was, West Ham had the only game worth playing and could drive a hard bargain. Some of us were pointing out the flaws in government thinking on the stadium close to 10 years ago. We were called cynics at the time and worse when the Games got underway. But it was always going to end in a desperate battle not to be left holding a very expensive baby, because the thinking was muddled from the beginning.\n\nShow your colours: West Ham will move in to the Olympic Stadium - don't rule out more fireworks\n\nOf the two, either West Ham or Leyton Orient, the only logical winner would have to be West Ham, but even then they are not going to fill the stadium unless it is a London derby or Manchester United are in town. I am split on whether they should leave Upton Park. From a financial point of view they should move, but compared to West Ham's spiritual home, the Olympic Stadium will be soulless and won't generate the same atmosphere, not even with 60,000. Teapot, North Herts\n\nThese are the shared concerns of every West Ham supporter and many have mixed feelings. Upton Park was always a fearsome place to go to, particularly under floodlights, and without doubt some of that edge will be lost. Having said this, perhaps the most ferocious atmosphere I have encountered in European football in recent years was at Napoli, where there is a running track and distance between the fans and the players. So it can be done.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nExpensive to keep. In a filthy state. Knock it down and the state wouldn't have to spend any more money. Sell the land to a developer. Fatharry, Middlesbrough\n\nTo build what? There is not enough demand for houses in Stratford and the City has already moved to Canary Wharf.\n\nA taste of things to come: How the Hammers will (kind of) look in their new home\n\nCrowd pleaser: Usain Bolt was one of THE stars of the Olympic Games last summer\n\nYou say the stadium was a cock-up \u2013 so where exactly were we supposed to have the Olympics? The stadium needed to be built regardless of what then happened to it. Fmxguy, United Kingdom\n\nIt isn\u2019t about whether the stadium was needed, it is about having the vision to build a stadium that had a future beyond last summer, without needing a complete refit.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nWest Ham's bid: a \u00a3500m stadium for dirt-cheap rent, remodelled with tax payers money. Tottenham Hotspur's bid: buy stadium outright, rebuild it as football stadium, remodel Crystal Palace athletics centre to state-of-the-art 25,000-seater stadium to fulfil Olympic legacy, all out of own pocket. Yes, West Ham clearly were the only option. Steve, Southampton\n\nExcept where were Tottenham last week, Steve? They got what they wanted out of their local council and stayed where they are rather than embark on a project that their fans despised and could have killed the club. By the end, West Ham were the only option. The one you cite did not exist.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nIsn't it typical of this country that absolutely no thought went into what would happen to the stadium after the Olympics? It could and should have been designed so it could accommodate football and rugby without the now obvious necessity and expense of adapting to be fit for purpose. Sheer economic folly. But when one considers that Lord Coe, with an absurdly elitist view of athletics, and Ken Livingstone and Tessa Jowell were the main drivers behind it perhaps we shouldn't be surprised. Economics Rocks, Welwyn Garden City\n\nNearly a decade ago in a column in The Times I compared Coe\u2019s attitude to that of opera subsidies versus popular musical theatre. In the end, the triumvirate you mention made such a monumental mess of it, we ended up with popular musical theatre, that the government had to subsidise as if it were opera. That takes some doing. And the newspaper in which that column appeared made Lord Coe its Man of the Year for 2012. Hey ho.\n\n\n\nTake a good look: Because you never know, Upton Park could soon be gone\n\nPresumably, when the West Ham owners sell Upton Park to property developers for many millions, all of the money will be given to the government? Or will it be trousered by Gold, Sullivan & Brady? I wonder. The reality is that West Ham have been handed a 54,000-seater stadium for little more than what they paid for a championship winger in the summer and as such have been given a massive financial boost just as the financial fair play rules begin. Royals Steve, Surrey\n\nThe Upton Park site is worth around \u00a340m, so at least \u00a315m of that will go to the government. It is a good deal for West Ham, I\u2019m not denying that. But the only reason it has fallen this way is because the last government, in alliance with Lord Coe and then Mayor Ken Livingstone, made a monumental mess of the project from the outset. So the moans are rather misdirected. As far as FFP is concerned, ground improvements are not covered.\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nI agree that West Ham is a better option than no option, but I still think Tottenham's bid would have been better for the country. Although it involved removing the athletics track it would have turned it into a proper football stadium instead of this horrible mish-mash. Luke, Manchester\n\nYes, Luke, but part of London winning the right to host the Games was the pledge to leave a large capacity athletics arena. Only one football club's bid guaranteed that legacy.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nSo the West Ham fan thinks his club should be given a free stadium like Manchester City were. What a surprise. J2kenny, Liverpool\n\nNo, actually, the West Ham fan is ambivalent about it, like many other West Ham fans. The impartial journalist, however, recognises West Ham were the only game in town and opines accordingly. And, just for that little pop, the West Ham fan is going to play you his favourite version of I\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles.\n\n\n\nWest Ham did not clean up the mess, they took advantage of the mess. I hope there is judicial review after judicial review until either West Ham pay for the full renovation, or they knock it down and build thousands of needed affordable homes on the site. The majority don't care that they got the stadium, most fans are laughing that they are moving there. But when a Premier League club is earning a minimum of \u00a360m a year in television rights and get this kind of deal it is taking the mickey out of every hard working taxpayer. Couple that with the rumoured \u00a3200m West Ham are said to make from building flats on its current ground, I think you can understand that we feel totally shafted.\n\nStephen, London\n\nThat\u2019s right, Stephen, because the government lawyers involved in judicial reviews work for free and with no charge to the taxpayer. West Ham will not pay for full renovation because it is not their problem. They wouldn\u2019t buy a stadium with no roof, poor sight lines and an athletics track. Nobody would. They are tenants, so the onus was on the landlord to get the place straight first. If you are shown a flat to rent and water is pouring in through the ceiling, you would demand the true owner got that fixed before you signed the agreement, yes? It\u2019s like that. This is why the government had to bend to make it work. And you think homes where Upton Park stand would fetch \u00a3200m? Halve it, then halve again \u2013 and it\u2019s still too much. I don\u2019t know what part of London you are from, Stephen, but I\u2019m guessing not the east. There are pockets where property had boomed, but Stratford isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nYou are totally wrong about West Ham clearing up the mess, they've just jumped into a vat of sludge themselves. Why can't you guys see the dangers ahead for West Ham? The moment they leave Upton Park, West Ham will no longer have a ground of their own. What happens if they ever hit hard times and go back to the Championship, or worse? If they ended up potless, that \u00a32million in rent for the Olympic Stadium might not seem so cheap. And you know the rules, if you can't afford the rent, you're out. Look at every club that has hit skid row. I can't emphasise enough the importance of owning your ground. And every person I speak to who has the club's future at heart does not want to move. Ian G, Walton-on-Thames\n\nI don\u2019t know a fan of any club who would not be nervous at the idea of renting a stadium. I would imagine, though, that the people doing the deal have considered it very thoroughly and conclude that, whatever league West Ham are in, they should be able to afford even an index-linked \u00a32m annual rent. I think this is a modern phenomenon, supporters thinking they know better than the people with the numbers in front of them. It is based on the mismanagement of a handful of poorly-run, rogue clubs. The current owners of West Ham are not in that category.\n\n\n\nMaybe it's because they're Londoners: (from left) David Sullivan, Boris Johnson, Karren Brady, Mayor of Newham Sir Robin Wales and David Gold were all smiles outside the Olympic Stadium\n\nNo one can blame West Ham for taking up an amazing opportunity. The Government should be looking very hard at the buffoons who scoped a stadium for one event and no future use without major redevelopment. Hold to account the people who are responsible for building the white elephant. Eric the Red, Manchester\n\nThis is not a problem for British taxpayers alone. Politicians, hangers-on, even well-intentioned people, decide that they need to build structures for sports events and trip over each other to enthuse, explain the need and benefits of pursuing such an endeavour. Alas, with rare exceptions, the taxpayer ends-up paying for it. Alex, Angola.\n\n\n\nDidn't the people organising our Olympics watch the programmes about the Greek venues, how they ended up as worthless ghost towns? It seems to me the people given the responsibility are very confident and good at talking, but don't have a lot of common sense. It\u2019s well presented hot air.\n\nPete McNerney, Liverpool\n\n\n\nWell said those men.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nYou're missing the point as regards West Ham and the Olympic Stadium. Yes, of course they were the obvious anchor tenants but what people are unhappy about is the deal that got done. Why should multi-millionaires get a facility like that and only chip in \u00a315m for conversion cost and \u00a32m a year rent? They will keep the funds from selling Upton Park, double the matchday ticket revenue and benefit from an enhanced Sky package from next year. West Ham needed the deal as much as the government did but you'd never know it from the way negotiations were handled.\n\nPete Channing, East Horsley\n\nLet\u2019s test that theory. If the sellers walked away, what would have happened to West Ham? They would continue at a much-loved, fit for purpose stadium that they can fill almost every week. If West Ham walked, the government are left with, what? The imaginary Grand Prix or the football club with 3,500 fans? Could Leyton Orient afford that \u00a315m, or the annual \u00a32m? Who needed the deal, do you say? Face it, Pete, if the sellers could have driven a harder bargain, they would.\n\n\n\n99 problems but the pitch ain't one: Jay Z is set to perform on the site of last summer's Olympic Games\n\nThis is a disgrace. I am glad the Tottenham bid failed as we are much happier with our proposed stadium locally. However, considering Spurs were offering to rebuild the entire stadium and pay for it, that West Ham were chosen is mind-boggling because the numbers don't add up. I'm glad West Ham have got it, but surely they should pay for it. Martin, London\n\nThey are paying for it, Martin. They are paying what it is worth.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nIt may take a while to recoup the money but this is the best option for the country. Nothing will get the money back like a Premier League football club. Apart from the \u00a315m, West Ham bring a lot to the table in terms of fans who will use the catering facilities and television exposure, meaning stadium sponsors will pay through the nose. It will be used regularly and still have a legacy.\n\nAndy Phipps, London\n\n\n\nThe naming rights issue is a huge one, Andy. What would naming rights be worth if Leyton Orient were tenants with minimal television exposure, for instance? Or would it be called the Matchroom Olympic Stadium?\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nYes, the public will own the stadium for the next 99 years. Martin makes this out to be a great justification for the bid, but in practice it just means that we get stiffed with the cost of upkeep and development, while West Ham pay a peppercorn rent and get massively increased revenue.\n\nNogbad T. Bad, Aberdeen\n\nActually, once the government makes the venue fit for purpose, West Ham are responsible for the upkeep, and can be evicted if they renege on this deal.\n\n\n\nNot a hammer: But there were seven other events in the heptathlon as Jessica Ennis won gold\n\nPerhaps they won't fill it, but here's an idea: make tickets available for working-class families that otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to watch Premier League football. Distribute tickets to local schools, get people into the game that otherwise wouldn't have a hope in hell of watching it. JasoninMadrid, Madrid\n\nAnd all that is planned, Jason.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nDoes anyone seriously believe that Daniel Levy ever had any intention of moving Tottenham to Stratford? Wasn\u2019t it purely a case of him wanting leverage with Haringey council? Come on people, wake up. NickP88, Chelmsford\n\nIndeed. Maybe this will help.\n\n\n\nDedicated to James and all at Venus, thanks for the memories...\n\nCan\u2019t wait until West Ham play Wigan Athletic, Stoke City, Queens Park Rangers or Fulham and there is a half-empty stadium. Terry1958, London\n\nYes, because its packed to the rafters and making fortunes for us all now.\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nSo at \u00a32m a year, which will be recouped in about three home matches, they only get to use the stadium for football games, is that right (1)? So do they get the profits from food and drink sales on match day (2)? They don't own the stadium so can't get any money from concerts right (3)? They won't be able to sell the naming rights for the stadium will they, because they don't own it, right or wrong (4)? 'The entire country could have had a crack at getting it working again,' you say, but didn't Spurs want a crack at it (5)? Why can't Orient rent it on days West Ham aren't playing, like a sports centre (6). And you support who again (7)? Baba O'Riley if you're gonna play The Who (8).\n\nThe Facehead, Newquay\n\nIn turn: (1) yes, (2) no they don\u2019t, (3) no they won\u2019t, (4) right, (5) no Spurs pulled out and stayed in north London, (6) they could but they aren\u2019t bringing much to the party and West Ham do need some identity at the stadium for it to be worth the while. (7) And the club I grew up supporting is well documented. As is the fact I don\u2019t do requests. (8) I\u2019m not Simon Bates, mate.\n\nNo requests: But you mentioned The Who so here they are on The Magic Bus... with girls and a baby elephant\n\nPeople seem to be upset that West Ham aren't planning on paying more than \u00a315m towards the stadium to get it ready, with the other \u00a3150m coming from the tax payer. This is not West Ham's problem really; it's akin to agreeing to rent a flat. Your new landlord would be expected to get it fit for purpose; not ask you to cover the bill for the mess the last tenants left. Zak Adams, The Elephant\n\nI think this deal is good for the taxpayer and West Ham. The rent starts at \u00a32million and is index linked so will increase. The stadium will be used for athletics as UK Athletics wanted and for concerts, the Rugby World Cup, possibly cricket and other sports including potentially the Commonwealth Games. None of this benefits West Ham financially and the profits will go to the state. West Ham are an anchor tenant in a multi-use stadium. Eastsider, London\n\n\n\nHowling in the wind, foIks. Howling in the wind. Logic gets you nowhere in this world.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nTake West Ham out of the equation and the tax payer would be paying far more, because athletics won't fill the stadium on a regular weekly basis nor will any other format. This is the best option all round. Will West Ham fill it? If they target the young who cannot afford the ridiculous prices of football with reduced tickets, then there is every chance they can and in doing so give football back, at least partially, to the kids and inspire future generations of football supporters that would otherwise have little chance to attend top-flight football. Terence Bates, London\n\nIt is precisely this that Barry Hearn finds so worrying. He thinks subsidised tickets will steal the next generation of Leyton Orient fans. I find it ironic that we keep banging on about how expensive football is and then when a club proposes cheaper tickets, everyone gets the vapours. Orient are a niche club with a niche following passed down through generations. Orient fans will continue to father Orient fans, no matter how many freebies are available up the road. They won\u2019t ever be Manchester United but they\u2019ll be fine.\n\nWhat a night: The opening ceremony lit up the London sky last year\n\nIt makes me feel quite depressed. Britain had the most cultured and technologically advanced stadium in the world and it was sold. Bring back the Olympics in 2024, Britain needs its party atmosphere. Ashy, Preston\n\nGet real, son.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nWhy are the football authorities and media so happy to steamroller Leyton Orient? Anybody would think they only care about Premiership clubs. Paul, Milton Keynes\n\nMaybe you are not a Milton Keynes Dons fan, Paul, but if you are please forgive me the hollow laugh.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................................................................\n\nNo mention made of the future of Leyton Orient, then. The Manxman, Isle of Man\n\nYes, I\u2019m told in Manchester United\u2019s boardroom they speak of little else.\n\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s all over. Thanks for playing. The debate takes a short break next week, so talk amongst yourselves for a while. Maybe you can persuade that bloke from Newquay to stick on The Who, if you\u2019re missing the musical accompaniment.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this one. I used to be in a band called the Academic Hamiltons. We weren\u2019t as good as our name. This promoter asked us to play a benefit gig for the unemployed at Poplar Civic Hall. We were undecided as the unemployed without doubt had more money than we\u2019d ever made from being the Academic Hamiltons.\n\n\n\n'This is a big chance for you boys,' the promoter said. 'I\u2019ve just turned down The Who.'\n\n\n\nOur lead guitarist was a bloke called Tony Billings. Good bloke, Tone.\n\n\n\n'Just turned down The Who, mate?' he said. 'What, on your f***ing stereo?'\n\nThe Academic Hamiltons became The Company She Keeps (with a far superior drummer). This is well worth a listen. See you soon.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

to those given to foreign sports stars", "text": "Classical musicians call for UK tax breaks similar to those given to foreign sports stars\n\nClassical musicians who visit Britain say they should receive tax breaks similar to those offered to foreign sport stars.\n\nOrchestra leaders says it is unfair top athletes are exempt from large tax bills on UK earnings to encourage them to compete. But they say talented musicians are subject to an \u2018aggressive\u2019 tax regime in an \u2018intensely bureaucratic\u2019 system.\n\nChancellor George Osborne has confirmed athletes participating in this summer\u2019s London Grand Prix will not face punitive taxes on their earnings.\n\nSour notes: 35 orchestras and classical musicians groups demand the same tax breaks enjoyed by athletes in an open letter to George Osborne\n\nUsain Bolt is one of the athletes who will benefit when he comes to race at the event in July. He has not competed in the UK since 2009 except at the Olympics due to the huge tax bill he would face on his 160,000 fee per appearance not including sponsorship fees.\n\nNon-resident foreign footballers and team officials competing in this month\u2019s Uefa Champions\u2019 League Final at Wembley were given a similar tax-free status in last year\u2019s Budget, as Uefa requires that countries which host the final \u2018do not levy domestic tax on non-resident players and team officials involved in the final\u2019.\n\nAn open letter to the Daily Telegraph signed by 35 orchestras and classical musicians group states: \u2018Our major cultural events and festivals are no less relevant than the Champions League Final or the London Athletics Grand Prix.\u2019\n\n\u2018International tax conventions adopted by the British Government arbitrarily treat artists and musicians as well as sportspersons and footballers differently from other categories of taxpayer.\n\nHowever this is compounded by the Government choosing to exempt foreign sports personalities from withholding tax to encourage major sports events to take place in Britain, while leaving in place an aggressive tax regime for visiting musicians and artists.\u2019\n\nNo tax: Athletes, including champion Usain Bolt, participating in this summer\u00bfs London Grand Prix will not face punitive taxes on their earnings\n\nThey say the \u2018discriminatory and intensely bureaucratic\u2019 tax regime should be amended, given that Culture secretary Maria Miller last week called for artistic groups to increase their \u2018economic impact\u2019 in order to receive public money.\n\nThey add: \u2018In many cases Britain\u2019s cultural organisations are forced to undertake arduous and time-consuming paperwork only to demonstrate that no tax is due at all.\n\n\u2018We would support any move that enabled British orchestras and concert halls to continue to attract the world\u2019s finest musicians and to compete in the global marketplace, to enable them to survive during these difficult times.\u2019\n\nGeorge Osborne said of Usain Bolt\u2019s appearance in London this summer: \u2018The Government is determined to do everything possible to secure the Olympic legacy and I am delighted to grant this exemption.\u2019\n\nThe musicians hit back saying: \u2018If we are looking to establish a legacy from the 2012 Olympic Games, we should be doing all we can to sustain the legacy of the Cultural Olympiad as well.\u2019", "images":

The party's over", "text": "Olympic legacy? The party's over... people need to suck it up and stop waiting for David Cameron to buy them a new bike\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week a visit to Philadelphia and the famous Rocky Steps produced a column on the fleeting, uncontrollable nature of legacy.\n\n\n\nObviously, we have a rather large sporting legacy project under scrutiny in Britain, and it brought a wide-ranging response.\n\n\n\nNow, to completely understand the first post, from Matty in Glasgow, you have to rewind to the original column and its assertion that legacy is a random creature and the most influential album of 1967 has proven to be not the massively popular and ground-breaking Sergeant Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, but something rather more confrontational and obscure that came out of Andy Warhol\u2019s arthouse set in New York. It gets a little noisy from here, though, mind you. Hold on to your hats.\n\n\n\nYeah, but Sergeant Pepper has got A Day In The Life on it, which is perfection. Matty, Glasgow\n\nYes it is, but the Velvet Underground and Nico has got this on it, which changes the way music sounds, Matt. Forever.\n\nAn Olympic legacy? I thought everyone recognised that for the joke it was, just an excuse to justify the \u00a39billion. We don't do legacy. Look at the Millennium Dome. That was supposed to be a cultural landmark for the nation and what is it now? A music venue. Sgtpluck, Almeria, Spain\n\nWhile I am always loathe to accept lectures on our nation from people whose address suggests they have opted out of it, I realise that Sergeant here could be on holiday or may only have emigrated last Tuesday, so I\u2019ll not be too presumptuous. His point about the Millennium Dome, however, misses the target. The bigger scandal is that it is now one of the most successful music venues in Europe and it took an America company, AEG, to realise this project. When our government had the Dome, the thing lay dormant costing millions in maintenance. It was a foolish extravagance from the start but surely it is the paucity of imagination on the part of the government once it had served its initial purpose that is the real scandal.\n\n............................................................................................................\n\nIf we spent \u00a39bn on the Olympics it is a bargain compared to the \u00a320bn cost of the Sochi Winter Olympics next year. So much needless negativity. TomDWilliams88, Norwich\n\nSo because the Russians have blown even more for no good reason that makes our expenditure right? I doubt if the great economists of the 20th century would share your rather bizarre fiscal theories, Tom. To be fair, some real dopes could probably spot the flaw in this one, too.\n\nThe start of the party: Fireworks at the Olympic Stadium lit up London at last summer's opening ceremony\n\nIf you want to see a grassroots success story that was undoubtedly boosted by the Olympics then take a look at Parkrun. What started off in Bushy Park in 2004 with just 13 runners now has 267 events operating every Saturday morning every week, and they are all free to enter and organised by volunteers. As of this Saturday 345,660 unique runners have completed 2,691,840 runs, all for free, and thousands give their time to make it happen. This is true grassroots stuff - from absolute beginners, through entire families with kids running with parents and grandparents, through club runners and even to double Olympic champions, Parkrun is for everybody of all ages, possibly like no other event. It's what sport can be about when you step away from the millionaire wages and return it to the people. Give them a chance and they will embrace it. Running Man, Datchet\n\nSounds impressive, Running Man. Although your moniker suggests you were an enthusiast to begin with. I\u2019m not trying to find obstacles here, the Parkrun movement is a great success and very admirable, but clearly it did not go from 13 to 345,660 participants in the space of less than a year since the Olympics. There was already forward momentum. The key is establishing how many have been directly inspired by London 2012. I\u2019m sure there are a number but would argue that the influence of family and friends in getting people active is often more powerful than legacy projects. Still, it\u2019s obviously a force for good, so please don\u2019t think I\u2019m knocking it.\n\nLeap of faith: Jessica Ennis-Hill was one of the gold medal winners expected to inspire a generation\n\nNot that I frequent the gym anymore, but I have seen more people out running and Halfords must have made a killing as the roads around my way are full of cyclists of all shapes and sizes. Gamesmaker, Suffolk\n\nWell, I do frequent the gym \u2013 I know, I know, but it\u2019s true nonetheless and all logged on computer for those requiring documentary evidence \u2013 and it has been the same old faces for some while now. Didn\u2019t really change much after the Olympics, either. As for cycling, depends where you live. I\u2019m in a forest and cyclist numbers have been increasing for many years, long before the Olympics. The same in central London. The government and various London mayors spent fortunes trying to get the city out of cars and onto bikes so, again, I\u2019m sceptical about how much of this is Olympic legacy, and how much alternate factors. How desperate do you think UK Sport were to justify Olympic expenditure? And even they couldn\u2019t come up with the figures.\n\nThe games were never going to have a legacy with the Tories in power. Predictably, as soon as they stopped leeching off the success of our athletes they instantly cut the funding for every sport. Without this, mass participation was never going to occur. Not looking forward to us going back to the days of only winning one gold medal at the Games because the Tories won't support sport properly. Big Bruce, Surrey\n\nMy old house had a giant school playing field at the bottom of it. The land was the match of a great many independent schools in the area, and better than some, but the school itself was failing. I said all along it should have been reinvented at a specialist sports academy. Rugby pitches, football pitches, all-weather hockey, a proper running track, build a swimming pool \u2013 which the town didn\u2019t have so there could be dual community use \u2013 a state of the art gym and indoor sports arena. They could have made it the school that every sporty kid in Essex wanted to attend, rather than the one that had the problem surplus from the surrounding areas dumped on it due to a downward spiral.\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Sold much of the land to private housing to fund the new school buildings which are now adjacent to bog standard, limited space playing fields. And guess who was in power throughout this, Bruce? Labour. So don\u2019t give me this party political crap. Nobody is sitting on a couch watching reruns of Total Wipeout because David Cameron doesn\u2019t want to subsidise basketball. If you\u2019ve got a street outside you can go for a run. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, mate, but we\u2019re skint. We can barely afford hospitals let alone volleyball. Something has got to give.\n\n\n\n'We're skint. We can barely afford hospitals, let alone volleyball,' was part of Martin's reply to Big Bruce\n\nAbout a month after the Olympics, our sports centre where we'd been playing basketball for over 10 years, decided to stop our Sunday night session because it wasn't bringing in enough money. Not only was this a blow for the dedicated player, it was a good way for people new to London to find a group of people with a similar interest. We had guys from all over Europe, America, Australia and New Zealand and the standard was quite high (some people had played in their respective national leagues or colleges). I joined after someone pulled a knife at a previous gym I used, so we worked hard to make it a place where new players felt welcome and safe, and younger ones could come and learn how to play properly. Now we have to organize it as a private session, at three times the cost, and it isn't really open to new people. AAA, London\n\nYou have my sympathy, Triple A. Without knowing the circumstances of how much the session was costing the council, however, and whether indeed the sports centre was council owned, or contracted out, it is hard to call. It does seem a lack of imagination on the part of your sports centre landlords to fail to see the positives of your previous session. Again though, in times of recession, it is hard to be too judgemental because everyone is under budgetary pressure. One imagines your council is still finding money for other stuff though; stuff that, as ever, seems more for them than you.\n\n............................................................................................................\n\nMy son watched the Games for the first time and has been going to our local athletics club every Tuesday. He has had his eyes opened to a whole world of sports. It needs funding, though, as most of these clubs rely on volunteers. Ant, Manchester\n\nThat\u2019s great, Ant. I\u2019m glad the Olympics inspired him. But a question: what do you suggest we lose to fund community athletics? We spent \u00a39bn being inspirational. At what point has sport got to look after itself?\n\n\n\nSome things will last: We all know Mo Farah's celebration following his two gold medals at London 2012\n\nA legacy means not selling off playing fields and making sports cheap to play. Mark, Watford\n\nYes, but the \u00a39bn that would have done that went on a three-week party for the elite.\n\n............................................................................................................\n\nBut it really did make British people proud to be British. The show was amazing.\n\nEd Dzeko, Coventry.\n\nYes, but now the party\u2019s over, so everybody needs to suck it up and stop waiting for David Cameron to buy them a new bike. And by the way, Ed, anyone who needed an Olympics to make them proud of a country that gave the world Shakespeare, JM Turner, Brunel, the industrial revolution, William Blake, the internet, Underworld and the NHS should be forced to live in Finland.\n\nOn your bike: People need to stop waiting for David Cameron... the party is over\n\n\n\n'London spent \u00a39billion on an Olympics designed to inspire a generation'. Did it really Martin? No input from the rest of the country? Really? Any reference to the true cost of the London Olympics being \u00a324bn, the vast majority of this spent on upgrading public transport infrastructure? What about the bonuses paid for underground drivers to work during this period? The athletic legacy might not have been all that was expected, but London, and Londoners, did very well out of the Olympics. The rest of the country just got the bill. Knowsbetterthanyou, Leicester\n\nIn that sentence from the column, \u2018London\u2019 is plainly shorthand for the London Olympic movement, not a direct reference to the city. I thought that much was obvious. Why not ask my dad how much the Olympics and Olympic regeneration has benefited Londoners? It has almost cost him his business due to the local upheaval. I\u2019ll write about it in painstaking detail one day: the truth about legacy. It is certainly not the golden gift for all Londoners that is imagined in the provinces, unless you thought what the capital needed was another shopping centre. Anyway, where were we meant to hold the Games? Leicester? They can\u2019t even get a statue up to Joe Orton. Manchester had been trying to get the Olympics for years and the IOC basically told our organisers that unless London bid we had no chance. If we wanted an Olympics, it was London or nothing, I\u2019m afraid. The debate is around the worth of the pursuit, not the location.\n\nBoxing clever: A trip to Philadelphia - where Rocky climbed the famous steps - inspired this week's column\n\nThe \u00a39bn was spent in the UK, created work for companies and 60,000 jobs for people who then paid tax and spent their wages in the country. Where did you think the money went? The economy had the benefit in the seven years leading up to the Games. What planet are you on?\n\nGerryR, London\n\nAnd yet, somehow, we\u2019re still up to our necks in it. Despite the fortunes generated, somehow the economy is still a bust, our credit rating has been downgraded and we are scrapping desperately to avoid triple dip recession. So maybe there is more to governance than just building a few stadiums and watching the money roll in. As for the jobs, look how many went to previously unemployed workers in the five London boroughs that hosted the Olympics. Not 60,000 mate. Not even sure they got to four figures when the building was being done.\n\nIconic: Stallone and the Rocky films have done wonders for the city of Philadelphia\n\nWhenever another billion or two was needed to justify the spiralling London 2012 costs, any number of LOCOG members went before the TV cameras and duly punctuated every sentence with the word legacy. They tossed it around like confetti at a wedding, its overuse reminiscent of the manner in which Tony Blair's cabinet, almost out of nowhere, began using the term weapons of mass destruction to soften up the British public for a likely Iraq invasion. Lord Coe grossly exaggerated his fuzzy and blurred vision for a participative legacy. The same is also true of Blair and his phantom WMDs. A participative legacy will always be hit and miss unless some kind of nudging or underpinning policy is established to help it move from desirable aspiration to grass roots reality. There never was a plan. Ken Livingstone couldn't care less about sport, only about East London's regeneration. To this end, his legacy has been the most real and visually tangible.\n\nKismet1001, London", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

going at events such as the London Youth Games", "text": "JOANNA ROWSELL: It's great to keep the Olympic legacy going at events such as the London Youth Games\n\n\n\nThis morning I went to the opening ceremony of the Balfour Beatty London Youth Games finals at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre.\n\n\n\nThis is Europe\u2019s largest annual youth sports event, featuring 80 competitions across 30 sports where competitors compete for their London Borough. This weekend is the finals weekend where the overall winning London Borough will be announced.\n\n\n\nOne of my first ever cycling races was this event back in 2004 where I competed for Sutton. I was a still a beginner but felt honoured to represent my borough and the competition between the different boroughs was fierce! I think events like this are really important as part of the legacy of the London Olympics and it was great to see so many kids out enjoying lots of different sports all in one place.\n\nChampagne moment: Joanna Rowsell (centre) celebrates after winning the women's time trial at the National Road Race Championships in Glasgow last month\n\nMy first role was to carry the flame and light the cauldron to open the Games and I was joined by Warren Russell from the dance group Diversity, who was also a former competitor in the LYG in gymnastics.\n\n\n\nAfter the formalities there was time to watch some sport before a Q and A session with some primary school children. These are always entertaining as the kids ask some very unusual questions. We were asked what our favourite food was, to which Warren said the very healthy sweet potato along with steak. I on the other hand said mine was chocolate! (Confessions of an athlete!)\n\n\n\nTough questions: Rowsell was grilled by primary school children\n\nThe best question though was from one girl wanting to know what pyjamas we wear... I\u2019ve never had that one before! She was chuffed to hear I have a onesie and proudly told me she has one too.\n\nI have had a break from training following the National Championships in Glasgow two weeks ago as I had my tonsils out last week. I am a frequent tonsillitis sufferer so I had the operation to take them out as a precautionary measure ahead of the next track season. I am on the mend now and riding steady before getting back into hard training next week. I have a super busy competition schedule coming up now for the rest of the road season and will carry on straight into the track season when the two seasons overlap in September so a bit of down time now should do me good.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

'threat to our Olympic legacy'\n\nMichael Gove under fire for jeopardising legacy from London 2012\n\n17 sports pitches disappear each year, most in Tory council areas\n\n\n\nLabour says 'parents will be shocked' by end of rules protecting fields\n\n\n\nMichael Gove was accused of jeopardising Britain\u2019s Olympic legacy yesterday as it emerged he allowed schools to sell off 50 playing fields over the past three years.\n\nOn average, 17 are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities.\n\nThe figures make a mockery of a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement.\n\nOlympic dreams: There is growing anger that 50 school playing fields have been sold over the past three years, which could jeopardise the future of British sport, said Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg\n\nThis followed the huge outcry over Labour disposing of playing fields at the slightly higher rate of 28 each year.\n\nShadow education secretary Stephen Twigg accused the Government of damaging sport. He said: \u2018David Cameron and Michael Gove are putting the Olympic legacy at risk.\n\n\u2018Parents will be shocked that the Tory-led Government is still selling off playing fields.\u2019\n\nDetails of plans to scrap rules on schools keeping a set amount of playing field space for team sports emerged on the eve of last year\u2019s Olympics.\n\nNew rules that came into force months later stated only that \u2018suitable\u2019 outdoor space should be provided for sport and play.\n\nEducation secretary Michael Gove is under fire after it emerged that 17 school fields are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities.\n\nAt the time, 35 applications to dispose of playing fields had been made \u2013 30 by Tory councils, four by Labour-run authorities and one by a Lib Dem council.\n\nThe Education Secretary initially said 21 had been approved \u2013 only to have to apologise and say the figure was actually 30.\n\nThe deals included the sale of a football pitch to a developer by Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, whose former pupils include gold medal-winning cyclist Dani King.\n\n\n\nElliott School in Putney, south London, was allowed to sell five acres of fields with six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground to make way for luxury housing.\n\nSeveral sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel.\n\n\n\nOnly five have been rejected by the Department for Education. The DfE claims the rule change is needed to allow more school places to be created quickly.\n\nBut Labour has warned that cuts in schools\u2019 capital budgets are leading to \u2018salami slicing\u2019 of school pitches.\n\nA total of 242 playing fields were sold off under Tony Blair or Gordon Brown from November 2001 to May 2010.\n\n\n\nThe DfE said last night that about two-thirds of disposals followed the closure or merger of schools.\n\nA spokesman added: \u2018The number of playing fields approved for disposal by the Government is falling.\u2019\n\n\n\nSeveral sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel.\n\nShe said it was schools and their local authorities that proposed to convert this \u2018often surplus or unused land to invest in sport or education\u2019.\n\nThe charity Fields in Trust said the DfE was now more \u2018transparent\u2019 about the decisions.\n\n\n\nBut chief executive Helen Griffiths warned: \u2018The focus now must be on ensuring that the growing body of [independently run] academies and free schools are subject to the same processes as local education authority maintained schools.", "images":

Croydon: South London town to benefit as Games 'boost UK economy by \u00a310million'", "text": "Our Olympic legacy... a new shopping centre for Croydon: South London town to benefit as Games 'boost UK economy by \u00a310million'\n\nReport boasts of \u00a39.9bn trade boost from Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\nEvery trade deal done since August has been linked to London 2012\n\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable admits claiming credit for some jobs and investment which would have happened regardless\n\n\n\nSmall businesses say they did not see boom for areas outside London\n\n\n\nThe Olympics have already given a \u00a310billion boost to the British economy, ministers claimed yesterday.\n\nIn a glossy 70-page brochure, ministers put the trade boom from the Games slightly higher than the cost of staging them last summer.\n\nBut the figures were immediately met with scepticism as the report directly linked the Olympics effect to building projects that included a shopping centre in Croydon, South London.\n\nBoom: As the anniversary of the Opening Ceremony approaches, the government claims the London 2012 Games brought a \u00a39.9billion boost to the UK economy\n\nAnniversary: One year on from London 2012 a 30,000-strong crowd enjoyed a day in the sun at the Go Local concert at London's Olympic Park\n\nBusiness Secretary Vince Cable conceded the figure was \u2018not a rigorous academic approach\u2019 and some of the investment \u2018would have happened anyway\u2019.\n\nBut he said London 2012 had been a catalyst for foreign investment into the UK and made projects progress more quickly than they otherwise would have.\n\nIn a report from the Government and the Mayor of London, it was claimed that the Games had already generated \u00a39.9billion for the economy, exceeding their \u00a39.3billion cost.\n\nThis includes \u00a32.5billion in projects such as the development of South London\u2019s Battersea Power Station backed by Malaysia, a Chinese-funded regeneration of London\u2019s Royal Albert Docks, and the forthcoming Westfield shopping centre in Croydon.\n\nPrime Minister David travelled to the Olympic Park to hand out goody bags to Olympic Games Makers who were there to celebrate one year on from the Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\nMr Cameron joined London Mayor Boris Johnson to see construction work which is transforming the site into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park which will be open later this month\n\nThe Australian firm \u2013 which already has two Westfield centres in London, including one next to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford \u2013 signed a \u00a31billion deal in January to revamp an existing shopping centre in Croydon, after being in talks since 2011.\n\n\n\nThe rest is made up of \u00a35.9billion of additional sales and overseas sports contracts awarded to British firms for events such as the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, both in Brazil.\n\nBy 2020, the Games could add \u00a341billion of value to the economy, the report says.\n\n\n\nMr Cable, speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, said: \u2018Would this have happened anyway?\n\n\n\nSome of these activities clearly would, but the Olympics were a key catalyst in making those investment decisions real.\u2019\n\nContracts: The report suggests that since the Olympic Park closed last summer British companies have gone on to win contracts for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio\n\nRebuilding: Construction workers have been on site since the closing ceremony preparing the venues to be reopened to the public\n\nBut Labour\u2019s Lord Harris, chairman of Parliament\u2019s Olympic and Paralympic Legacy Committee, said: \u2018I\u2019m afraid you have to take all of these figures with a large pinch of salt.\u2019\n\n\n\nMr Cable said: \u2018The answer we\u2019ve had with a lot of the high-profile investment is that a lot of the key negotiations [with investors] came out of the events that we organised around the Olympics.\n\n\n\nAn enormous amount of effort was put in to try to attract big inward investment, to try to support British businesses to get business on the back of it.\u2019\n\n\n\nDuring the Games, lavish hospitality was extended to foreign dignitaries and business leaders at the British Business Embassy in Lancaster House in London, in the hope of attracting a trade windfall.\n\n\n\nDavid Cameron yesterday said: \u2018This \u00a39.9billion boost to the UK economy is a reminder to the world that, if you want the best, if you want professionalism, if you want jobs done on time and on budget, then you should think British.\u2019\n\nClaiming credit: Business Secretary Vince Cable admitted some of the investment would have happened anyway while London Mayor Boris Johnson claimed a new shopping centre in Croydon could be attributed to the Olympics\n\nDoing deals: David Cameron used the Games to meet business and political leaders in London, including Russian President Vladimir Putin at a judo event",

our history", "text": "On first anniversary of greatest Olympics, Coe warns: Drug cheats are driving bulldozer through our history\n\nA full year has passed since a flame flared, a flag flew and a glorious spectacle unfolded. But as the nation celebrates an anniversary week of rose-tinted reverie, the man who gave us the London Olympics is in no mood for nostalgia. With the future of his tainted sport at stake, Sebastian Coe is preparing to fight a bloody battle.\n\nThe revelation that the sprinters Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell had failed tests for banned drugs left Lord Coe 'absolutely livid; angrier than I've been for a long time'. As a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), he has the power to translate that anger into effective action. And the consequences of failure could not be more hazardous.\n\nClean win: No doubts about London 2012 100m gold medalist Usain Bolt \u00bf but (left to right) Justin Gatlin, Yohan Blake, Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell now all have drug-test history\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) currently impose a two-year ban on first offenders. This represents a compromise by athletics, which had pushed for mandatory four-year bans.\n\nCoe bitterly regrets the concession. 'We shouldn't have sold the pass, but we did,' he admits. 'We did it because it made life easier for some sports. It took them from nothing to two years. But it did our sport no favours at all. I'm no longer prepared to sit here and say that it's acceptable, because it isn't. We've got to get rid of the cheats, because if we get rid of them, we'll be giving clean athletes the chance to compete fairly and win things. That's what it's about.\n\n'I recognise that we live in a legal world where a life ban is not going to happen. We would lose that in any court. But four years should be the penalty. The proportional damage of a high profile case in my sport is significantly greater than in most other sports. We are different. If some sports are happy with two years, that's fine. But we're too high-profile now to withstand this kind of abuse indefinitely. Four years sends a message, it really does affect a career. I'm going to fight for this, fight all the way.'\n\nThose of us who have observed Coe down the decades will recognise a classic twin-pronged technique at work here. As an idealist, he really does feel fervently about this moral issue. Indeed, if he does not win his case, then all the signs suggest that he would walk away from his position at the IAAF.\n\nBut, as a politician, he is aware that most WADA board members are well-disposed to four-year bans, which the organisation's new code is expected to introduce from 2015 when it is approved at the World Conference on Doping in Sport in Johannesburg in November. Coe is, therefore, seeking to accelerate the process and bring along the doubters.\n\n\n\nUpset: Lord Coe was 'absolutely livid' at latest doping scandal\n\nFierce passion and shrewd pragmatism; London's success in staging the most stunning Games in Olympic history owes a huge debt to that combination. His current anger aside, Coe is relishing the chance to revisit recent history, culminating in the Anniversary Games in the Olympic Park over three days next weekend. 'It's nice when people come up to me on the street and talk about what it meant to them,' he says.\n\n'It had a really big impact, and I don't think we realised it at the time. For those of us working on the Games, it just went too quickly. I remember my Dad saying to me: \"You'll get to the age of 40, and you'll remember everything. Then, suddenly, you'll be 70, and you won't have noticed the passing years.\" I'm sure he was right.\n\n'I was in Singapore in 2005, trying to win the right to stage the Games. Next thing I knew, I was standing in a holding room in the Olympic Stadium, scribbling notes on a piece of paper before speaking to an audience of four billion people. Madness. Of course, I was thrilled that it all went so well, and so safely.\n\n'I mean, we were in Singapore when we heard about the London bombs. From the very first day, we had that act of barbarity in our minds. So we all sat through London saying: \"Let's just get through another day, then another, and another.\" We all knew what the real risk was: a group of people standing by the roadside watching, say, Bradley Wiggins coming past on the big screen. And just at that moment, something unspeakable happening. Mercifully, it never did.'\n\nYet the dizzy success of Olympic and Paralympic Games was, in Coe's view 'only the midway point of the story'. As he says: 'This was a 20-year journey: two years to win the right to bid. Hats in the ring in 2003. Two years of criss-crossing the globe to win the vote. Another seven years to deliver it.'\n\n\n\nStunning: London 2012 was a dazzling success\n\nAnd then, after bringing off the Games, there began the work of delivering the legacy. Coe is aware that the Olympic legacy is, for some, an inviting target. So he says, cautiously: 'I actually think the first year after the Games has had a very promising start. I'm not going to over-claim, but we do have more people playing sport - a million and a half more than in 2005.\n\n'We've now got Join In, connecting clubs and groups with the community. More than 10,000 events have already registered for the Join In Summer. We have put \u00a3150million into primary schools for sport. British businesses have reported an extraordinary dividend from markets that have opened up to them because of the Games. Visitor numbers and visitor spend are up significantly. Eight venues in the Olympic Park now have a secure home.\n\n'We also have a decade of sport ahead which is the envy of the world, in large part because our governing bodies gained confidence from the Games. There isn't a world championship worth its name that isn't going to be put on in this country over the next 10 years. We can't allow these events to just be jewels in the landscape and not convert kids to sport. We haven't done that well in the past. We didn't make as much of winning the 2003 Rugby World Cup as we should have done. We won a hockey gold medal at the Olympics of 1988, and we didn't make the most of that.\n\n'Lots of problems, lots of difficulties. And yet, I would have settled for it in the first year of the second half of the journey.'\n\nThe claim is measured and the tone reasonable, but suddenly he remembers the crushing blow that track and field has suffered through the drug cheats. 'You know, the thing that makes me most angry is the fact that they're trashing our history,' he says. 'It's like driving a bulldozer through a war cemetery.\n\n'It is appalling that they don't understand what people like Jesse Owens, Herb Elliot and Fanny Blankers-Koen meant in our sport. If you don't understand your history, if you don't understand where you come from, then it might even look acceptable to cheat with drugs. Well, it's bloody not.'\n\nSeb Coe's message was safely delivered.

goodbyes despite knowing their jobs would be axed after 2012", "text": "Olympics bosses receive \u00a32.8million in golden goodbyes despite knowing their jobs would be axed after 2012\n\nAll 144 staff who left Olympic Delivery Authority received pay-offs last year\n\n\n\nFour bosses had \u00a3261,000 in exit payments within months of London 2012\n\n\n\nODA chief executive Dennis Hone now head of Olympic legacy body\n\nCritics condemned 'utter disregard' for use of public money\n\n\n\nLondon Olympics bosses received \u00a32.8million in pay-offs despite knowing their jobs would end after the 2012 Games.\n\nAll 144 people who left the Olympic Delivery Authority last year received redundancy pay as the agency was wound down.\n\nFour executives received \u00a3261,000 in exit payments after leaving within months of the closing ceremony last summer.\n\nPay-offs: Every person who left the Olympic Delivery Authority last year received redundancy pay, despite knowing their jobs would not last beyond the 2012 Games\n\nThe pay-offs will raise questions about the use of public money because all of the recipients will have known their jobs were not going to last far beyond the London 2012 Games.\n\nThe ODA insisted the payments were necessary because senior managers gave up lucrative jobs elsewhere \u2018with no certainty of the project's success or getting a job after the Games\u2019.\n\nAccording to the annual accounts of the ODA, a total of 144 people received redundancy pay-outs in the last year.\n\nThree people left with pay-offs worth \u00a370,000-\u00a380,000, two received between \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000 and two between \u00a340,000 and \u00a350,000. Almost half received between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000.\n\nGolden goodbye: Dennis Hone left as chief executive of the ODA with an \u00a380,000 golden goodbye - and became head of the London Legacy Development Corporation\n\nMatthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It beggars belief that the Olympics quango employed staff on permanent contracts .\n\n\n\n'Taxpayers' money has been wasted on payouts that were entirely avoidable had staff contracts reflected the fact that working on the Olympics was quite obviously a temporary role.\n\n\n\n'The utter disregard shown for value for taxpayers' money by Olympics chiefs is both shocking and worrying, especially as the government are holding up the Olympics as an example of how to manage big infrastructure projects.'\n\nDennis Hone, the ODA chief executive, received \u00a3929,000 in pay, bonuses and pensions during just two years in the job.\n\nHe left with a pension pot worth \u00a31.9million. He was made redundant at the end of March, with a golden goodbye worth \u00a380,000, as well as an immediate pension of \u00a3373,000.\n\nBut he walked into a new job as chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation.\n\nAccording to the accounts Mr Hone was entitled to receive statutory redundancy pay and a pay-off bonus equivalent worth 60 per cent of his \u00a3233,000 salary.\n\nIt was agreed he would receive a lower \u2018terminal bonus\u2019 of 49 per cent of his salary and half of it will only be paid once the sale is completed on the East Village, the athlete\u2019s village which is being turned into homes, schools and shops.\n\nThe ODA's director of transport, Hugh Sumner, also received \u00a373,000 in exit payments, on top of his \u00a3189,000 salary, \u00a335,000 bonus and \u00a323,000 employer\u2019s pension contribution.\n\nSimon Wright, director of venues and infrastructure, received a golden goodbye worth \u00a372,000 when he left the ODA in November.\n\nDuring seven months he earned \u00a3151,000 salary, a \u00a335,000 bonus and \u00a318,000 towards his pension.\n\nRebuilding: David Cameron joined London Mayor Boris Johnson last week to see construction work which is transforming the London 2012 site into the Queen Elizabeth Olympic park which will be open later this month\n\nAnniversary: One year on from London 2012 a 30,000-strong crowd enjoyed a day in the sun at the Go Local concert at London's Olympic Park\n\nDirector of human resources Wendy Cartwright, who earned \u00a3177,000 last year in pay, bonuses and pension, received \u00a336,000 in exit payment.\n\nThe ODA insisted that only Mr Hone received extra cash, with all other staff given statutory redundancy pay, any leave they were unable to take before their employment ended, and, where appropriate, payment in lieu of notice.\n\nA spokesman added: \u2018London 2012 was a unique and challenging project and a great British success story and we needed to recruit and pay for the best talent from the private and public sectors, requiring people in many cases to give up secure long-term jobs elsewhere, with no certainty of the project's success or getting a job after the Games.\n\n\u2018We had to adopt a flexible approach to managing staff contracts to ensure that key people, especially directors, remained with the project throughout periods critical to its success, until such time as the ODA could be certain that their skills and knowledge were no longer required. Our staff delivered this huge project on time and under budget - in fact making savings of over \u00a31 billion for the public purse.\n\n\u2018Like other staff, Dennis Hone received performance-related pay, but this was far from guaranteed and was measured against tough performance criteria, evaluated personally and in relation to the organisation he successfully led in the critical 18 months up to the Games, during London 2012 and immediately after.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

we win the Ashes Test and Tour de France, MPs say children should avoid competitive sports because it can put them off exercise for life\n\nMPs say safeguarding Britain's Olympic legacy involves getting as many children as possible to enjoy non-competitive activities\n\nThey warn competitive sports have limited appeal and a focus on winning can be counter-productive\n\n\n\nCompetitive sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives, MPs have warned.\n\nSafeguarding Britain\u2019s Olympic legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities, they say in a report out today.\n\nThe Commons Education Committee warned that competitive team sports have a \u2018limited appeal\u2019 to some children and politicians\u2019 focus on them can be \u2018counter-productive\u2019.\n\n'Limited appeal': While children may look up to sporting heroes such as Tour de France winner Chris Froome (pictured) MPs warn that a focus on winning is sure to put some children off exercise\n\nNumber one: As England celebrate the euphoria of trouncing Australia in the Ashes, MPs publish a report saying shifting the focus from competitive to non-competitive sports will help tackle obesity\n\nDuring the Games last summer David Cameron announced that competitive team sports would be made compulsory for all primary school children in England.\n\nHe pledged funding for new sports teachers to inspire the next generation of top athletes, and expressed concerns that Indian dance was being counted as physical education.\n\nBut the committee of MPs urged the Department for Education to make clear to schools that there should also be non-competitive activities to increase the wellbeing of all children, and help control obesity.\n\nThe committee chairman, Tory MP Graham Stuart, said the 2012 Games was a \u2018magical time\u2019 which generated \u2018massive enthusiasm\u2019 for sport among young people.\n\nOlympic legacy: David Cameron (pictured with Olympic sailor Ben Ainslie and Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds) had promised that competitive sports would become compulsory in primary schools\n\n\u2018High-quality school sport is vitally important,\u2019 he said. \u2018It provides young people with opportunities to improve their education, health and well-being.\n\n\n\n'We need to be encouraging all young people to take part in sport; whether they enjoy the competition of football, rugby or netball or prefer non-competitive activities. Schools must provide a range of activities that appeal to all.\u2019\n\nCompetitive sports \u2018can bring many benefits to young people in terms of resilience, organisation and team work\u2019, the report said, but a focus on winning \u2018can be a disincentive as a much as incentive\u2019 for some children.\n\nWhile the Government has injected \u00a3300million into primary school sports provision for the next two years, the MPs warned there is no long-term plan when that ends in 2015.\n\nThey said ministers needed to act to make sure the momentum was not lost \u2018amid short-term plans and funding\u2019 or their promises risked becoming a \u2018gimmick\u2019.\n\nInclusive: MPs say that safeguarding Britain's Olympic legacy means getting as many children as possible to engage with exercise rather than focusing on coming first\n\nThe committee took evidence from education think tanks, as well as the Youth Sport Trust and the Rugby Football Union, which recommended more provision for non-competitive sport \u2013 although 59 per cent of primary schools said they offer this in the form of activities such as dance.\n\nMeanwhile 67 per cent of primaries said their pupils entered inter-school competitions.\n\nAll 17,000 primary schools in England and Wales have been given funding to improve their sports provision until 2015, and around 120 dedicated sports teachers are being trained.\n\nMr Stuart said: \u2018We are concerned that the Government\u2019s primary sport premium \u2013 while correctly focused \u2013 is only being given to schools for two years.",

But I'm afraid the Olympic legacy is bitter disappointment", "text": "They made us so proud. But I'm afraid the Olympic legacy is bitter disappointment\n\nFew of us will have any trouble remembering what we were doing exactly a year ago tonight. Along with most of the human race, we were watching one of the great spectacles of modern time.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s debut as a Bond girl? Danny Boyle\u2019s industrial revolution? Mr Bean? We all have a favourite moment from the opening ceremony of the London Olympics.\n\nAnd even those who never got a ticket will remember the national transformation that followed. Britain suddenly felt a great deal better about itself. Until then, we hadn\u2019t challenged the myth of our post-war, post-imperial decline.\n\nLondon 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony was ended with spectacular fireworks\n\nThere will be more of the same magic over this weekend as Jessica Ennis and the gang return to a sold-out Olympic Stadium for the Anniversary Games\n\nNow, we were pleasantly reminded that, in fact, we were actually really rather good at colossal events; at building things and running trains on time. As it turned out, we\u2019d also learned to win once again. With the glorious Diamond Jubilee on top, that whole summer now seems swathed in red, white and blue.\n\nOne year on, and the 2012 magic is still working. Andy Murray, the British Lions, the Ashes, the Tour de France \u2014 not to mention Prince George.\n\nThe scenes outside Buckingham Palace on Monday night were pure 2012. The crowds were cheering in every language on Earth, and even the drunks were pleasant.\n\n\n\nOne year on, and the 2012 magic is still working with athletes like Andy Murray continuing to fly the flag for Britain\n\nAnd there will be more of the same over this weekend as Jessica Ennis and the gang return to a sold-out Olympic Stadium for the Anniversary Games.\n\nTo cap it all, the Government has published a shiny report claiming the Games have not only generated \u00a39.9 billion, but that legions of idlers have been inspired to crawl off the sofa and shape up. A new slimmer, richer Britain is here. Is there no end to the miraculous powers of the rings? Or is this a moment to pause, sober up and return to reality for a moment?\n\nFor let\u2019s recall that we were told some whopping great fibs in the run-up to the Games. Boris Johnson has repeated his \u2018on time and on budget\u2019 mantra so often, it seems to have ossified in the public mindset.\n\nThe Games were on time, of course. But on budget? The budget, when we won the bid in 2005, was \u00a32.4 billion. Over the next seven years, it almost quadrupled to \u00a39.3 billion. If you hired a builder for an agreed sum, and his bill went up four-fold, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d let him proclaim he\u2019d been \u2018on time and on budget\u2019. You\u2019d take him to court.\n\nThe scenes outside Buckingham Palace on Monday night were pure 2012. The crowds were cheering in every language on Earth, and even the drunks were pleasant\n\nBut then, as the Olympics would show time and again, where public money is involved, different rules apply. Hence the \u00a32.8 million redundancy bonuses and pay-offs for various Olympic high-ups announced this week. We all knew that \u2018London 2012\u2019 was going to end in 2012. So why were these people not employed on fixed contracts?\n\nBut while there\u2019s been no shortage of public cash to throw at grand buildings and Olympic executives, some of our sporting stars have fared less well. Despite winning the first British gold of the Games (along with fellow rower Heather Stanning), Helen Glover still has no main sponsor and can barely afford to repair her car.\n\nLikewise, with no main sponsor, the men\u2019s rowing team (some of whom are 6ft 8in) will have to squash into the cheapest seats at the back of the plane for next month\u2019s world championships in Korea. Even long-jumper Greg Rutherford, one of the gold-medal heroes of \u2018Super Saturday\u2019, was dumped by Nike soon afterwards \u2014 and now lacks a sponsor.\n\n\n\nThe budget, when we won the bid in 2005, was \u00a32.4\u00bfbillion. Over the next seven years, it almost quadrupled to \u00a39.3\u00bfbillion\n\nNone of them ever went in to this for the money. But it\u2019s hardly a great come-on for young athletes to know that Olympic glory is substantially less rewarding than being a lower-league footballer.\n\nSo, what of those future athletes? According to the new \u2018Inspired by 2012\u2019 legacy document, 1.4 million more people are now playing sport. But take a closer look: this figure straddles a seven-year period. The actual number of extra people playing sport in England since the 2012 Olympics is, well, none. Because the numbers have dropped by 100,000.\n\nLook at the Sport England data on, say, the number of people who are members of sports clubs. There has been a drop of more than 200,000 since last year. Over a five-year span, there\u2019s been a drop of 670,000.\n\nSport England insists that more people are playing \u2018informal\u2019 sport. \u2018A lot of people now prefer to have a game of five-a-side football than join a club,\u2019 says a spokesman. As for the decline in post-Games activity, Sport England puts that down to bad weather in March. It hardly stacks up to a sporting revolution.\n\nBoris Johnson has repeated his 'on time and on budget' mantra so often, it seems to have ossified in the public mindset\n\nJust this week, Sir Keith Mills, former deputy chairman of 2012, complained that a \u2018barmy\u2019 lack of co-ordination between Government departments was squandering any legacy at local level.\n\nThe greatest fib, though, was not a sporting one at all. It was Danny Boyle\u2019s brilliantly choreographed opening-ceremony tribute to the National Health Service, \u2018the envy of the world\u2019 and all that \u2014 complete with Florence Nightingale-style nurses in starched uniforms. Had we known then what we know now \u2014 about the thousands of unnecessary deaths in recent years; the institutional, serial maltreatment of the helpless; the cover-ups and gagging orders \u2014 then there would have been more hollow laughter than applause.\n\nLooking back, Boyle might wish he\u2019d lionised one or two other British inventions instead. It\u2019s not as if he was short of material: the jet engine, the railway, television \u2014 even football . . .\n\nJust this week, Sir Keith Mills, former deputy chairman of 2012, complained that a 'barmy' lack of co-ordination between Government departments was squandering any legacy at local level\n\nNow, I freely admit that I was what Boris Johnson called an Olympic \u2018doom-monger\u2019. I genuinely feared we were going to end up with a similar multi-billion-pound shambles to the one you still find in Athens, host of the 2004 Games. A year afterwards, I was apprehended there by the police for watching a property developer bulldozing a supposed \u2018legacy\u2019 venue. On my last trip, I found that the grass in the Olympic softball stadium came up to my shoulders. You could keep a tiger in there, and no one would know.\n\nThere were never any doubts that our Olympic fortnight would go according to plan. But at what cost? And what would be the true legacy?\n\nThe 1976 Montreal Games almost bankrupted that city, and today its Olympic stadium has no main tenant. Likewise the Olympic stadium in Barcelona. Even Sydney, host of the great Olympiad of 2000, was left with a vast complex of redundant venues that took years and billions of dollars to sort out.\n\nAnd, like many, I also resented the way that the whole of Britain had to subjugate itself to the puffed-up International Olympic Committee. When shops were threatened with prosecution for putting Olympic displays in the window, our Government should have told the IOC where they could stick their precious rings. But come that momentous evening, exactly one year ago, all those concerns simply faded away. Lord Coe and his magnificent team had taken a huge gamble, had endured seven years of carping from us doom-mongers, and delivered a triumph. As the Queen appeared to float in from on high, the brilliant originality and titanic scale of London 2012 was already sinking in.\n\nNow that a year has passed, however, we should regain a sense of perspective. Parts of the new official report are simply Toytown accounting.\n\nIt claims, for example, that the planned redevelopment of London\u2019s Battersea Power Station by a Malaysian consortium is a direct result of the Olympics. In fact, this grey elephant has been changing hands for the past 30 years, and a deal was in place long before the first backside sat on the first Olympic seat.\n\nMy favourite section states: \u2018Bespoke economic modelling utilising an input-output framework suggests that the impacts that can already be clearly identified at this early stage will in total generate some \u00a328 billion to \u00a341 billion in GVA [Gross Value Added].\u2019 Oh dear. The fibbing really has got out of hand. At least the Business Secretary, Vince Cable, had the decency to admit: \u2018Would this have happened anyway? Some of these activities clearly would, but the Olympics were a key catalyst.\u2019\n\nLord Harris of Haringey, the Labour chairman of the Lords\u2019 Olympic and Paralympic Legacy Committee, is more succinct: \u2018I\u2019m afraid you have to take all of these figures with a large pinch of salt.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a pity the Olympic organisers still feel obliged to bombard us with fairy tales, because there is plenty of tangible economic benefit to applaud. The Games gave a huge boost to Britain\u2019s international standing. Take the rankings of the International Congress and Convention Association. Thanks to the Games, London is up from 19th to sixth place. That unquestionably translates into serious business spending flowing into Britain from overseas.\n\nAnd I have no doubt that the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will become a major tourist attraction in due course. Just not yet.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s a bombsite, as the temporary venues \u2014 such as the 12,000-seat basketball arena \u2014 are removed, and the others \u2014 such as the aquatics centre and velodrome \u2014 are converted for civilian use.\n\n\u2018Everything is exactly on schedule,\u2019 says my guide, Dennis Hone, chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, which is rebuilding the park. \u2018There\u2019s been a complete change in the way people think of this part of London. And that\u2019s what the Olympics have done.\u2019\n\nCertainly, the locals can look forward to an enormous new public space and what will surely be the smartest municipal baths in history. Thanks to the fancy-pants roof, that aquatics centre alone will have cost \u00a3270 million.\n\nIt is a reminder of the way in which the great London Olympic adventure got out of hand.\n\nYes, the people of Newham now have a lovely place to swim \u2014 but at the expense of other people all over the country who still have nowhere to swim because the Olympics soaked up the cash. Up in Sheffield, the Don Valley Stadium, which produced, among others, Jessica Ennis, has run out of money and is to be demolished.\n\nNext year, Glasgow hosts the Commonwealth Games. Obviously, it will be a more modest affair but it still involves 6,500 athletes and officials, 71 nations, one million tickets and a television audience of up to a billion.\n\nYet, it has managed to deliver an Olympic-class swimming facility for \u00a313.5 million. The organisers have achieved this by adding a second 50-metre pool to Glasgow\u2019s existing complex, and sending the divers to the Edinburgh diving pool built for the 1970 Commonwealth Games.\n\nAnd the cost of these entire Games \u2014 including venues for 17 sports? Less than one-and-a-half times that of the single new swimming centre in London: just \u00a3371 million.\n\nThe Olympics were a wonderful party, they have revived a desolate area of London, and it was unquestionably a very good thing that they happened. Lord Coe thoroughly deserves a place in the pantheon of great Britons.\n\nYet the Games have not kickstarted a grassroots sporting renaissance, however much the politicians and the blazers insisted they would. No Olympiad ever has.\n\nNor were they ever going to come in on budget or be a masterclass in handling public money. If you want one of those, look at the Diamond Jubilee (0.001 per cent of the Olympic bill). So let\u2019s just stop pretending that London 2012 was perfect, that it was a bargain, and that there are no lessons to be learned.\n\nThe real legacy of that glorious event was the enhancement of our self-esteem and our reputation. Let\u2019s just keep on enjoying that as long as we can.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26157344-0-image-a-11_1584611009461.jpg",

legacy... we're still winning\n\n\n\nWe all missed a trick as we basked in the glory of London 2012 a year ago. Forget putting your trainers on and venturing out for a run, or watching the Queen\u2019s audience with James Bond for the umpteenth time, we should have invested in a company that conduct polls.\n\n\n\nYou couldn\u2019t move this week for mind-numbing surveys pledging to evaluate whether London 2012 really was worth \u00a39billion, yet producing largely only extrapolated fluff. Are our kids fitter? Or is our adult population fatter post-2012?\n\n\n\nPlease, give us time to catch our breath: it\u2019s only been a year. The paint\u2019s still too fresh on all those gold postboxes to talk conclusively about the dreaded \u2018L\u2019 word, legacy.\n\nBig draw: Usain Bolt captivated thousands at the Anniversary Games\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, a quick trip to the Olympic Stadium this weekend would have saved everyone a lot of bother. Over the course of three days, some 180,000 people dusted off their Team GB kit and gently nestled back into the smiley, dreamlike state that characterised last summer at the Sainsbury\u2019s Anniversary Games.\n\n\n\n\u2018Ooh, it\u2019s nice to be back,\u2019 they cooed, cheering on Usain, Mo, Jess, Jonnie and David like they were old mates and reminiscing about a year in which British sport absolutely nailed it.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re still coming to terms with that, after all. It\u2019s not a very British thing to crow about success, yet we now have the Wimbledon and Tour de France champions, a Lions series win over Australia and a dominant England cricket team in the Ashes to boast about.\n\n\n\nWe rocketed to third in the Olympic medals table and then pledged to better that in Rio in 2016, but have yet to feel comfortable sitting pretty on our perch. We don\u2019t deal with Plucky Brits these days, only winners like Ennis-Hill, which takes some getting used to.\n\n\n\nA year on, this is the sporting legacy of London 2012 that you can see and feel, following a Games that produced British Olympic and Paralympic role models beyond our wildest dreams.\n\n\n\nOur \u2018no compromise\u2019 high- performance system, which channels National Lottery and exchequer funding to elite athletes in selected sports is \u2018the envy of countries around the world\u2019, according to Baroness Sue Campbell, the former chair of UK Sport and now of the Youth Sport Trust.\n\nWarning: Baroness Campbell feels there is more work to be done if a generation is to be inspired\n\n\n\n\u2018The high-performance system has, unquestionably, been a success thanks to the massive investment going in,\u2019 she said. \u2018It won\u2019t go back, either: it will flourish and be allowed to grow.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe challenge now is to not drop the baton, like the Government did by cutting \u00a3162million of funding for school sport before reinvesting \u00a3150m in a primary school system that refuses to see physical education as a pathway to achievement.\n\n\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to be in the bashing brigade,\u2019 said Campbell. \u2018There have been some very positive things, but if you look at what the promise was, to inspire a generation, then I think we\u2019ve still got some work to do.\u2019\n\nChampion: Ennis-Hill has given the country much to cheer about\n\n\n\nKeeping the spotlight on Olympic sports, and our star athletes, is therefore imperative.\n\n\n\nAthletics\u2019 Anniversary Games could be moved to Glasgow\u2019s Hampden Park or an \u2018iconic\u2019 London venue next year, while a new roof is put on the Olympic Stadium ahead of its use in the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n\nBritish Athletics are \u2018hopeful\u2019 they could squeeze in a temporary track and come back to Stratford in 2015, but the three-day festival of athletics will return to West Ham United\u2019s new home in 2016 ahead of the IAAF World Championships the following year.\n\n\n\nWhether that competition is a sell-out like this weekend, and whether British athletes are still winning, will be a much better indication of London\u2019s legacy than any number-crunching survey.\n\nPacked: Around 180,000 people attended the Anniversary Games at the Olympic Stadium\n\n\n\nWhat they said\n\nOlympic shot put champion Valerie Adams said exactly what she felt when discussing how she was denied her golden moment at London 2012 by a drugs cheat. \u2018I was p****d off,\u2019 she said. Quite.\n\nStraight to the point: Adams did not hold back when asked about being beaten by a drugs cheat\n\n\n\nPerformance of the week\n\nBritain\u2019s Liam Phillips won all six races on his way to becoming the BMX world champion in Auckland yesterday. In a sport as unpredictable as BMX, it\u2019s little wonder Phillips\u2019 coach described his dominance as \u2018phenomenal\u2019.\n\nUnstoppable: Phillips won all his races as he became the BMX world champion\n\n\n\n..and this is what I've been doing this week\n\nWatched Channel 4\u2019s coverage of the IPC World Athletics Championships in Lyon. I like the way the presenting team use humour to avoid the sickeningly sweet worthiness that can sometimes accompany disability sport.\n\n\n\nNoted Hope Powell still appears to be in charge of the England women\u2019s football team, despite their disappointing Euro 2013 campaign. How is the team \u2014 and the growing game it represents \u2014 ever supposed to improve if the status quo is maintained without the slightest challenge?\n\n\n\nEnjoyed seeing field events given more prominence than usual at the Anniversary Games, owing to the two-day Diamond League programme. There were world-record attempts in the high jump and pole vault that really had to be seen to be believed.", "images":

London will be biggest in UK", "text": "A cool Olympic legacy: Giant indoor ski centre in East London will be biggest in UK\n\n\n\nThe announcement that Stratford is to get its own indoor ski slope will come as welcome news to Londoners looking for novel ways to cool off in the heatwave .\n\n\n\nBut the proposed development at the Westfield shopping centre in east London - which could cost up to \u00a3200 million - won\u2019t open to the public until 2015.\n\nAiming high: Boris Johnson compared the project to Ski Dubai, which is the world's biggest ski dome\n\nLondon Mayor Boris Johnson announced that the facility will be the UK\u2019s largest indoor ski centre and will feature \u201creal\u201d snow.\n\n\n\nWestfield Stratford City will submit a planning application to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) by the end of the summer for the leisure attraction to be built on land next to the shopping centre.\n\nIt will feature several ski runs, the longest of which will be 300 metres, along with snowboard ramps and an ice-skating rink.\n\nThe Mayor compared the project to Ski Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, which covers 22,500 square metres and is the world\u2019s biggest ski dome.\n\nInvestment: The ski slope will be built on land next to the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford\n\nThe ambitious east London development, which was first proposed in 2011, will also include hotels, restaurants and more shops.\n\n\n\nThe Mayor also confirmed that \u00a367.5 million worth of contracts had been awarded for the redevelopment of the Olympic stadium, which will be home to West Ham football club from 2016.\n\n\n\nWork will soon begin on the construction of a new roof, which will be twice the size of the original and will improve the acoustics for football matches and concerts.\n\nMr Johnson, said: \u201cOne year on from London's Olympic and Paralympic Games and we are defying the sceptics who prophesied a herd of white elephants.\n\n\n\n\u201cStratford's status as a stunning new destination is confirmed by Westfield's plans for a world-class indoor ski centre. This underscores the massive confidence in this area from investors which is delivering a real pay back for taxpayers in terms of jobs and the regeneration of East London.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Olympic Park has been renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and will reopen to the public in stages\n\nThe Olympic Park has been renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and will reopen to the public in various stages.\n\nThe Copper Box, which was home to handball during the Games, reopened as a sports centre on 27 July and the stadium saw the return of Olympic and Paralympic super-stars last weekend to mark the anniversary of the London 2012 Opening Ceremony.\n\n\n\nThe picturesque parklands in the north of the Park opened to visitors yesterday and a new waterfront park is expected to open in April 2014.\n\nThe Athletes\u2019 Village has been transformed into East Village, a mixture of private, shared-ownership and social-housing properties, while around 800,000 visitors a year are expected to visit to use the Aquatics Centre when it reopens in spring next year. The centre will feature a creche, changing facilities, a cafe and a new public plaza.\n\nPicturesque: The parklands in the north of the Park opened to visitors yesterday\n\nThe South Plaza, located between the Olympic Stadium, Aquatics Centre and the ArcelorMittal Orbit, is set to open at Easter 2014.\n\nAt this point visitors will have access to the whole of the Park and the space will feature interactive fountains, giant swings and climbing walls and \"garden rooms\", designed by Piet Oudolf, which will host a different theme or activity.\n\nNew entrances, in the form of tree-lined promenades, will open via Westfield shopping centre and Stratford High Street in Newham. They will connect open spaces that will be used for cultural programmes, pop-up street food stalls and community events.\n\nThe Park's waterways will be used for water taxis and kayaking along with possible floating restaurants and cinemas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mayor told the Evening Standard that Eurostar was \u201cmissing a trick\u201d by refusing to stop at Stratford International station.\n\n\n\nThe station was used to run a high-speed train service between the Olympic Stadium and London St Pancras.\n\n", "images":

Coalition government'", "text": "Pupils taught two hours of PE a week as amount of time spent on lessens 'halves under Coalition government'\n\n300 teachers questioned in study by education select committee\n\nJust 43 per cent claimed that their pupils enjoyed two hours of PE a week\n\nA damning study by MPs has found that pupils are getting less than two hours of PE lessons a week.\n\nThe education select committee questioned more than 300 primary and secondary school teachers, less than half of whom claimed that school children have two hour of sports education each week.\n\nJust 43 per cent said pupils enjoyed two hours of physical work a week, compared to 90 per cent in the academic year 2007 - 2008, when the sports survey was carried out under Labour's government.\n\nTeachers' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant PE was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable\n\nThe figures suggests that since the Coalition came to power in 2010, the number of children having at least two hours worth of sport lessons has halved, the Daily Telegraph reported.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that teachers' comments suggested that a full curriculum meant PE was often sacrificed in order to meet the criteria of the timetable.\n\nBut the Department of Education said to compare with it the survey conducted in 2008 was 'ridiculous' because the earlier study spoke to more than 21,000 schools and asked different questions.\n\nA spokesman said: 'It is ridiculous to compare a scientific research study of more than 21,000 schools to a self-selecting survey of just over 300, and each with completely different questions.'\n\nThe survey comes after comments made by Baroness Campbell, the head of the Youth Sport Trust, earlier this year.\n\nThe Coalition has emphasised it's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting Olympic legacy\n\nShe claimed that many children starting secondary school were unable to throw a ball, catch, jump or run.\n\n\n\nShe said that even pupils inspired to take up a sport after watching the Olympics missed out because teachers were not well trained enough to help them.\n\nThe Coalition has emphasised it's commitment to reforming sport in schools to create a lasting Olympic legacy.\n\n\n\nIn 2010 the Government said that far too few children were participating in regular competitive sport and that schools be given the freedom to organise more competitive sport.\n\nMinisters want to encourage more competitive sport so it is a vibrant part of the ethos of all schools.\n\nEarlier this month Lord Coe helped launch a new \u00a3150 million grant for school sports facilities. The investment comes as the Government unveils plans to train teachers to specialise in PE at primary school.\n\n\n\nLord Coe said: 'The problem in primary schools is that PE has become too much of a lottery. If you have a head teacher \u2013 male or female \u2013 who understands sport then probably you\u2019ll have a better chance of getting good provision.\n\n\n\n'But if their experience of sport was not good then that tends to filter through the school. It occurred to me that the big gap in provision was in primary schools.'\n\nHowever, in a direct contrast the Government's goal of creating more a more competitive atmosphere when it came to physical games, last week a group of MPs warned that such sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives.\n\n\n\nSafeguarding Britain\u2019s Olympic legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities, they said in a report published on July 22.\n\n\n\nThe Commons Education Committee warned that competitive team sports have a \u2018limited appeal\u2019 to some children and politicians\u2019 focus on them can be \u2018counter-productive\u2019.", "images":

they took part in the 100-mile RideLondon event that preceded the first Prudential London-Surrey Classic.\n\nEnormous crowds turned out to witness the first of what promises to be an annual fixture along roads featured in last year\u2019s Olympics, with the likes of Matt Dawson, Sally Gunnell and Emmerdale soap stars Kelvin Fletcher and Jason Merrells adding a touch of celebrity.\n\nOne disappointment was the absence of leading British riders from the professionals\u2019 race.\n\nTrue leadership: Boris Johnson at the head of the field as the 100mile RideLondon event began\n\nFamous faces: James Cracknell and Matt Dawson were both riding in the charity race\n\n\n\nBradley Wiggins won Saturday\u2019s Tour of Poland time trial while Mark Cavendish won the final stage of the Tour of Denmark on Sunday.\n\nTour de France winner Chris Froome is taking a break after the post-Tour criteriums in Europe.\n\nSo, after the British win in Paris two weeks ago, the French triumphed on the Mall.\n\nArnaud Demare, 21, from the FDJ team, won the mass sprint at the end of the 137-mile race ahead of Italian Sacha Modolo. Britain\u2019s Ben Swift, of Team Sky, faded in the sprint to finish 10th.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

International Cycling Union's (UCI) management committee in Florence, means track cyclists will have the chance to compete again at a venue where Britain won nine Olympic medals in 2012.\n\nHosts: The London velodrome will host the 2016 Track World Championships\n\nWinners: Dani King, Laura Trott, and Joanna Rowsell will be looking for more medals\n\nBritish Cycling's chief executive Ian Drake said: 'Winning the bid to host the final track cycling world championships of the next Olympic cycle is important strategically for us, it's good for the current generation of athletes, but it's also an important tool for inspiring the next generation who will follow in their footsteps.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

tourism as it reveals 2014 highlights\n\nVisitEngland has revealed its highlights for 2014 and the English Tourist Board is hoping the so-called \u2018Wiggins effect\u2019 will help to boost visitors to the UK next year.\n\nThe Tour de France starts in Leeds next July, with the first three stages on British roads, and the event will showcase the picturesque English countryside to the world.\n\nHighlight: The Tour de France riders will pass through northern cities such as York before heading to London\n\nRiders will visit Harrogate, York, Leeds, Sheffield and Cambridge, before heading to London to finish, as the Olympic road races did, on the Mall.\n\nAlong the route they will pass through the Yorkshire Dales, Epping Forest and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.\n\nVisitEngland\u2019s Chief Executive James Berresford said the Tour was 'a fantastic opportunity for Yorkshire and will showcase to the world the outstanding beauty and breath-taking landscapes of this wonderful area of England'.\n\n\n\nLeeds will host the Grand D\u00e9part on 5 July, with the stage taking the riders north through Otley, Ilkley and Skipton before heading to Harrogate.\n\nStage two see the riders heading west from York towards Haworth - the village that was home to the Bronte family - and passing through Holmfirth, the filming location for long-running BBC sitcom Last Of The Summer Wine, before reaching Sheffield.\n\nThe third stage will start in Cambridge and head to London via Epping Forest, with the riders completing a circuit of the Olympic Park before finishing on the Mall, where the 2012 Olympic road race ended.\n\nSuccess: Bradley Wiggins celebrates his Tour de France win in 2012 and, right, a map of the 2014 race route\n\n\n\nChristian Prudhomme, Tour de France Director, said the success of the Grand D\u00e9part in London in 2007 had made him keen to return to the United Kingdom and he praised Yorkshire as a 'region of outstanding beauty, with breathtaking landscapes whose terrains offer both sprinters and attackers the opportunity to express themselves.'\n\nThe success of Bradley Wiggins and his fellow cyclists Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Sarah Storey has seen a leap in the number of people jumping into the saddle.\n\nThe cycling market is growing 10-15 per year and will be worth over \u00a33bn by 2015, according to VisitEngland's research. As a result, 25 per cent of us (3.8 million) are keen to go cycling on holiday.\n\n\n\nOlympic legacy: The Lee Valley VeloPark in London opens to the public in March\n\nThere will be plenty of opportunities for holidaymakers to get in some practise. The Lee Valley VeloPark opens to the public in March, allowing access to its four cycling disciplines (track, BMX, road and mountain biking) and L'Eroica, the famous historic Tuscan bike tour dubbed as 'the most handsome bike race in the World', is coming to the UK in June.\n\n\n\nL'Eroica Britannia will travel through the Peak District National Park on a three-day festival, known as 'The Great British Adventure', celebrating the area's heritage, local food and drink, and the joys of cycling. Adventurers can choose a 30, 50 or 100 mile route to be ridden on pre-1987 bikes.\n\nOther highlights for the 2014 tourism calendar include the celebration of Shakespeare\u2019s 450th birthday in March, the opening of South Park of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, and the opening of the \u00a34 million Richard III Visitor Centre in Leicester.", "images":

"rank_151": {"title": "CHARLES SALE: West Ham and Leyton Orient condemned for 'squabbling like children' over Olympic Stadium", "text": "West Ham and Leyton Orient condemned for 'squabbling like children' over Olympic Stadium\n\n\n\nTHE conflict between West Ham and Leyton Orient over shared occupancy of the Olympic Stadium has been reignited by a damning House of Lords report into Games legacy.\n\nThe select committee called the dispute between the football clubs a \u2018disappointing distraction\u2019 and recommended that Orient \u2014 with whom West Ham do not want to share their new home from 2016 \u2014 are at least granted occasional use, providing finances can be agreed.\n\nResult: West Ham should allow Leyton Orient to occasionally use Olympic Park, says new report\n\nCommittee chairman Lord Harris of Haringey was even more critical in a press briefing, saying the clubs\u2019 behaviour was \u2018unedifying\u2019 and that they were like \u2018children in the playground squabbling as to who goes down the slide first\u2019.\n\n\n\nHe added: \u2018There have been too many closed minds when this needs to be talked through properly. I\u2019m not convinced that people have sat down to make this happen.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe committee has no power to enforce changes, but Lord Harris said he expected the recommendations, which include giving one Cabinet minister responsibility for all strands of Olympic legacy, to be considered very carefully.\n\n\n\nWest Ham remain opposed to sharing, believing the crucial clause in the report is a comment from London Legacy Development Corporation chief Dennis Hone that it would \u2018cost the public sector money to open the gates to Leyton Orient in a 60,000-capacity stadium because of the club\u2019s relatively low existing gates\u2019.\n\nThere appears to be no chance of a men\u2019s GB football team competing in future Olympic Games. This follows the FA categorically telling the House of Lords legacy committee that it had \u2018no intention\u2019 of fielding a men\u2019s team while the other home nations oppose a women\u2019s Olympic football entry. However, the FA say they are \u2018committed to discussing a future women\u2019s Team GB\u2019. This comes at a time when the FA\u2019s huge commitment to women\u2019s football, at club and international level, is worrying a number of FA councillors who believe it is vastly out of proportion to spectator interest.\n\nRight on time: England Coach Stuart Lancaster\n\nEngland rugby coach Stuart Lancaster revealed during his address at a leaders in football conference how he measures progress via a performance clock. The aim is to have the team approaching midnight, with clock hands aligned, in time for the 2015 World Cup; the abject 6pm low point was the 2011 World Cup debacle. After this autumn series, Lancaster reckons England\u2019s clock is at 10pm.\n\n100 club: England batsman Kevin Pietersen\n\nKevin Pietersen's kit sponsors, adidas, looked into giving him golden cricket boots to wear for his 100th Test in Brisbane this week, similar to the ones worn by another client, All Black Dan Carter, to mark his century of caps at Twickenham. International Cricket Council regulations forbid Pietersen\u2019s proposed footwear, but his adidas bat will have stickers embossed with large gold lettering on it for the Ashes opener celebrating \u2018KP 100th\u2019.\n\n\n\nConnected: Former Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon (right)\n\nBoro follow Kenyon tip\n\nPeter Kenyon, former Chelsea chief executive, is working closely with Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson. And it was Kenyon\u2019s connections with agent Jorge Mendes, with whom he runs third-party ownership football funds, that led to Boro appointing Spaniard Aitor Karanka, one of Jose Mourinho\u2019s assistants at Real Madrid, as the club\u2019s first foreign manager.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

Stadium\n\n\n\nPreparations are now under way to construct the new roof on the Olympic Stadium, which is set to be West Ham's home from the 2016/17 season.\n\n\n\nThe first of 14 floodlight panels is to be removed later this week to allow the development, which is twice the size of that for the London 2012 Games, to press on in the spring.\n\n\n\nThe cantilevered roof, which measures some 84 metres at its deepest point, will be the longest of its type in the world and will cover every seat at the 60,000 capacity venue, with the work scheduled to be completed by 2015 to host some Rugby World Cup matches.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nTaking a look: West Ham captain Kevin Nolan, Mark Noble, Joe Cole and Mohamed Diame (L-R) pose for the photographers at the Olympic Stadium\n\nWest Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady hopes all of the new innovations in the project will make for a smooth transition to The Hammers' new home when they eventually leave Upton Park.\n\n\n\n'This marks a key milestone in the stunning, \u00a3200 million transformation of the Olympic Stadium - one that will culminate in an iconic new home for our club,' she said.\n\n\n\n'My team and I fought exceptionally hard on behalf of our supporters to ensure these modifications, which we knew were of paramount importance to our supporters, took effect.\n\nGloomy: Weather conditions delayed the removal of the first floodlight panels The future: A CGI mock-up of West Ham playing at the Olympic Stadium\n\nAll smiles: Joe Cole poses for photographers as he checks out West Ham's future home\n\n'The roof is a truly phenomenal design that will enhance the iconic status of this sporting arena and help to lock in the world-famous atmosphere that our supporters create when we play at home.\n\n\n\n'There will also be an innovative seating solution that will bring fans closer to the pitch, new hospitality areas and a bespoke ticket office and club store.\n\n\n\n'It was vital for us that this stadium offers an incredible viewing experience for West Ham fans and I think that will become ever clearer as the conversion progresses.\n\n\n\n'We are wholly committed to delivering a state-of-the-art home for West Ham by 2016 that will honour the Olympic legacy pledge.\n\nChange of scenery: A view of the construction site at the Olympic Stadium shows a very different scene 15 months on from London 2012\n\n'Today represents another significant step toward that hugely exciting goal.'\n\n\n\nAn agreement between the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) and West Ham saw the Barclays Premier League club take on a 99-year lease, with the Olympic stadium to be transformed into a 60,000-seater venue in time for the 2016/17 season.\n\n", "images":

London 2012 Athletes' Village gets its first residents after accommodation was turned into flats\n\n\n\nThe first residents of newly refurbished apartments used to house athletes at last year's Olympics to move in\n\n\n\nPrivate tenants and shared-owners will move into the East Village in Stratford, East London at the weekend\n\n\n\nThe complex will contain 2,818 flats and townhouses by the time work is completed in early 2014\n\n\n\nThe Mayor of London described regeneration of areas as one of the 'key legacies' of 2012 Games\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first residents of the refurbished Olympic village have started moving in to the former athletes' accommodation this weekend.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this week, 50 of the 2,818 flats and townhouses will be occupied by tenants and first-time buyers in shared-ownership deals with affordable housing provider, Triathlon Homes.\n\n\n\nGet Living London will privately rent 1,439 of the apartments, of which 45 have already accounted for.\n\n\n\nThe first tenants and part-owners will move into the refurbished homes in Stratford, East London, this weekend over a year after the Olympic Games\n\nThe former athletes' accommodation has been transformed into one, two, three, four and five bedroom flats some of which will be privately rented\n\nThe privately rented flats start at \u00a3310-a-week for a one bedroom property and can cost as much as \u00a3525-a-week\n\nSince the end of the London Games contractors have been busy refurbishing and remodelling the village which housed over 17,000 athletes during last year's Olympics.\n\n\n\nWork continues on many of the apartments which vary in size and price, though letting agents are confident they will soon be snatched by property-savvy house hunters.\n\n\n\n'As soon we announced we were taking control of the properties about six months ago people were signing up,' said property consultant Sam Martin from Get Living London.\n\n\n\n'The first tenants are moving in this weekend, with more due to move in in coming weeks.\n\n'They're going very quickly,' he said.\n\n\n\nThe apartments are split into 16 plots which each have five or six blocks that centre around private courtyards.\n\n\n\nNeighbouring public spaces including new parklands, wetlands and children\u2019s play areas, in addition to a new Academy school which began admitting students in September, and a health centre that took in its first patients this week.\n\n\n\nThe development had to undergo significant refurbishment after athletes' departed last year as temporary walls and structures had been put in place for the duration of the Games\n\nNew roads have been built and adopted with names that celebrate the Olympic heritage of the area include Cheering Lane, Prize Walk and Celebration Avenue.\n\nCulture Secretary Maria Miller said: 'London 2012 was a phenomenal success that put Britain at the centre of the global stage.\n\n\n\n'The regeneration of East London was central to the bid to host the London 2012 Games and with the first residents moving into the East Village this is further proof that the Olympic Legacy is continuing to be delivered.'\n\n'This area of London has been transformed over the last decade with jobs created, a huge investment in local transport, world-class sporting venues that will be used by the local community and stage major events and thousands of people set to be able to call the Olympic Park home.'\n\n\n\nThe Mayor of London, Boris Johnson added: 'I am hugely pleased to hear that the first residents are now moving into the East Village.\n\n\n\n'Providing thousands of new homes was one of the key legacies of the 2012 Games, and the new neighbourhoods we are creating around the Olympic Park will surely become some of the most popular places to live in the capital.'\n\n\n\nNew resident Shardae Carr stands in her apartment at the newly transformed East Village which houses 2818 flats in total\n\nFirst-time buyers have the chance to step onto the property ladder with over 350 of the apartments available for shared ownerships\n\nThe blocks commemorate the 2012 Games with buildings being named after the five colours of the Olympic Rings. Themed art is scattered across balconies on the site in East London Privately rented one bedroom properties start at \u00a3310-a-week, while five-bedroom flats costing at least \u00a3525.\n\nMartin Tovee will move into his brand new one-bedroom flat upon its completion in this weekend.\n\nThe 48-year-old is thrilled to be a part of the first legacy neighborhood to come out of the 2012 games.\n\n'With a new job to get used to and family just 200 miles away in Macclesfield I'm looking forward to making use of the new community that will be on my doorstep,' he said.\n\nA stone's throw from shopping centre Westfield, the village will also benefit from hundreds of new independent retailers and businesses due to set up shop. All of the homes have been built to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4, ensuring the best levels of unsulation and energy efficiency possible for residents.\n\nMore than ten hectares of new parks and open, green space, has been created as part of the regeneration with 2,500 trees planted throughout the village which also boasts six acres of wetlands area.\n\nForty-five people have already signed up to privately rent apartments in the complex that was built to housed around 17,000 athletes during last summer's Olympic Games\n\nUnderground parking and access to Olympic venues such as the Velodrome and the Aquatic Centre are some of the perks residents will enjoy", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/11/26/article-2513872-19A756F500000578-371_970x575.jpg",

over the last three years\n\nFailed asylum seekers have been given an \u00a380,000 astroturf football pitch paid for by taxpayers as schools are forced to sell their own grounds.\n\n\n\nAsylum seekers got their own sports facility at Campsfield House, Kidlington, Oxfordshire, to use while they are waiting to be deported.\n\n\n\nWhile struggling schools are selling their own facilities to pay for improvements, the 216 men at the centre also have a fitness suite, IT centre, library and are given money for winning sports competitions.\n\nCampsfield House Detention Centre in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, now has a new astroturf pitch\n\nBanbury Academy, which is near to the centre, is selling its playing fields to developers for \u00a3750,000 so it can afford to build a new sports hall and an all-weather pitch for students.\n\n\n\nThe school says selling the playing fields is the only way to fund 'desperately-needed' improvements.\n\nAccording to the Sun, North Kidlington primary is holding jumble sales to fund a new play area and children at Bletchingdon primary have to walk 800 yards to a village hall for PE lessons.\n\n\n\nUKIP campaigner Paul Nuttal told the Sun he thought the money spent at the detention centre was wrong.\n\nHe said: 'While services are stretched to breaking point, taxpayers are forking out so illegal immigrants can have a good kickabout.'\n\n\n\nLast summer, it emerged that 50 playing fields had been sold off over the last three years in what was labelled a 'threat to our Olympic legacy'.\n\n\n\nOn average, 17 are closed every year, most in Conservative local authorities.\n\n\n\nThe figures make a mockery of a pledge to protect them in the Coalition agreement.\n\nBanbury Academy, which is near to the centre, is selling its playing fields to developers for \u00a3750,000\n\nThis followed the huge outcry over Labour disposing of playing fields at the slightly higher rate of 28 each year.\n\n\n\nThe deals included the sale of a football pitch to a developer by Barton Peveril Sixth Form College in Hampshire, whose former pupils include gold medal-winning cyclist Dani King.\n\n\n\nElliott School in Putney, south London, was allowed to sell five acres of fields with six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground to make way for luxury housing.\n\n\n\nSeveral sales have gone ahead against the advice of the independent playing fields panel.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

West Ham sell ground as part of biggest London football stadium redevelopment\n\n\n\nBoleyn Ground set to be turned into East End 'village' of 700 homes\n\nGaillard Group have won the bid to buy the stadium\n\nWest Ham will move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016\n\nThe Hammers have played at Upton Park since 1904\n\nA tribute to Bobby Moore will form centrepiece of ground's legacy on the site\n\nThe 'village' is scheduled to be completed by 2018\n\n\n\nWest Ham have sold the Boleyn Ground, their home for 110 years, to developers Galliard, paving the way for their move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016.\n\nPlans for the site, called \u2018East End Village\u2019, include 700 homes.\n\n\n\nFans and residents are expected to vote on naming apartment blocks after West Ham legends such as Bobby Moore, Trevor Brooking, Geoff Hurst and Billy Bonds.\n\n\n\nVIDEO Scroll down to watch Kevin Nolan and Mark Noble visiting the Olympic stadium\n\n\n\nAll change: West Ham's famous Upton Park ground has been sold to be turned into 700 flats\n\nLocal lad: West Ham star Joe Cole poses for photographers at the Olympic Stadium last year as work continues to turn the arena into West Ham's new home\n\nThe site will also feature a claret-and-blue theme to reflect West Ham\u2019s colours.\n\nIt is understood the purchase price fell short of the \u00a371.2million the stadium is valued at in club accounts.\n\nNo financial details have been disclosed but a report in the London Evening Standard suggests that the club will raise less than the \u00a371.2 million the 35,016 all-seater stadium is valued at in its accounts.\n\nOnce the site has been fully developed experts expect it to eventually be worth hundreds of millions of pounds with the apartments expected to prove attractive to fans, investors and other buyers desperate to get a foothold in the London property market.\n\nBlocks of apartments will be built around central public gardens where the pitch is currently laid, following the example set by Arsenal\u2019s former Highbury stadium home in Islington, north London.\n\n\n\nA statement on the club's website read: 'West Ham United can confirm that Award-Winning local London developer Galliard Group has reached an agreement to purchase the Boleyn Ground Football Stadium once the club completes its move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016.\n\n'Following a competitive bidding process, West Ham United selected Galliard Group as the purchaser for the site ahead of a number of other national and international companies.\n\n\n\n'The club was impressed with Galliard Group's links to the local community and their commitment to honouring the history of the Hammers at the Boleyn Ground as part of their proposed development.'\n\nAway blaze: West Ham captain Kevin Nolan (left) wheels away after scoring his and the Hammers' second in the 2-0 win at Aston Villa\n\nThe first match to be played at the iconic Boleyn Ground was against Millwall in 1904.\n\n\n\nWest Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady added: 'We opted to reach an agreement with Galliard because they are a local London developer and employer with origins in east London. We know they are committed to working closely with the local community and Newham Council on proposals to transform the site into a residential and retail village, which will benefit the local community and east London's regional economy.\n\n\n\n'The deal demonstrates that we have been true to our word by securing the regeneration of two areas of east London through our move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016.\n\n'In addition, and most importantly for us, we can see that Galliard are passionate about working with West Ham United to engage their supporters to help deliver a fitting legacy that will honour the tradition of the famous ground. We are confident that West Ham United fans will be excited about their vision and the way they plan to respect more than 100 years of West Ham history at Upton Park.'\n\n\n\nStephen Conway, chairman and chief executive of Galliard Group, said: 'Galliard is one of London's most successful regeneration specialists and has a proven track record in stadium land regeneration.\n\n", "images":

Olympic sports\n\n\n\nBritish Swimming has notified UK Sport it intends to appeal against the decision to withdraw funding from the women's Olympic sports of synchronised swimming and water polo.\n\nUK Sport announced the move on February 4 with basketball also losing all of its Olympic funding.\n\nBritish Swimming chief executive David Sparkes said a formal request had been made to make representations to UK Sport board.\n\nBlow: UK Sport has decided to withdraw funding from the women's Olympic sport of synchronised swimming\n\nAppeal: Water polo has also seen funding withdrawn but British Swimming intends to appeal the decision\n\nSparkes said: 'It's vital we have the opportunity to engage with UK Sport once again as we look to save these team sports from simply becoming a chapter in a history book rather than a lasting, Olympic legacy.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

"Brownlee brothers get on their bikes in support of Yorkshire Festival of Cycling...and take a ride through the set of Emmerdale while they're at it!\n\n\n\nAlistair and Jonny Brownlee believe a big summer of cycling in their native Yorkshire can help keep the Olympic legacy alive and well.\n\n\n\nThe brothers, who were among the stars of London 2012 with Alistair taking gold and Jonny bronze in the triathlon, grew up running and riding the roads of the White Rose county.\n\n\n\nThe eyes of the world are going to be trained on those routes when the Tour de France's Grand Depart arrives on July 5/6, beginning with a stage between Leeds and Harrogate and continuing between York and Sheffield.\n\n\n\nWheels: Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee get on their bikes ahead of the Dare 2b Yorkshire Festival of Cycling\n\nThe Tour forms the centrepiece of the Dare 2b Yorkshire Festival of Cycling, hosted at the historic Harewood House Estate, and the Brownlees, who act as ambassadors for the event, hope it can inspire in the same way as the Olympics.\n\n\n\n'The Tour de France is probably one of the top five sporting events in the world and it's something we've both watched as long as we can remember,' said Alistair Brownlee.\n\n\n\n'It's very exciting to see it starting here on the roads we've cycled every day since we were kids and passing less than a mile from our house.\n\n\n\n'The Yorkshire Festival of Cycling is about making the most of that legacy, encouraging people to be involved and get out riding.\n\n\n\nSupporting cast: Alistair (right) and Jonathan outside The Woolpack on the set of Emmerdale\n\n'That's an ongoing process. We all saw how popular the Olympics was and how many people were inspired but it's a bit like a fire that needs a log thrown on every now and again to keep it burning.\n\n\n\n'The Olympics was a pretty big log but it needs a prod every so often and it's fantastic to be doing this in Yorkshire.'\n\nJonny Brownlee, who finished second in the triathlon world series last year, is equally enthused and believes his home county will lend a new edge to the Tour.\n\n\n\n'Yorkshire is perfect cycling country - it has hills and flats and the country roads are a great place to ride,\" he added.\n\nSibling rivalry: Jonathan (left) and Alistair compete in the men's triathlon at the 2012 London Olympics\n\nWinners: First placed Alistair (left) embraces Jonathan at the end of the men's triathlon during London 2012\n\n'It's a beautiful place for the Tour but it will be a hard course. It's full of short, steep hills which is different to France. The Alps and the Pyrenees, which we all see on TV, are all long climbs but Yorkshire is short, sharp and completely different.'\n\n\n\nNeither one of the brothers is decided on whether to pursue the World Series title this season, with a minimum requirement of six races across the globe to be in contention.\n\n\n\nBut one goal that is firmly on their radar is the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\n\n\n\nTriathletes: Alistair celebrates with gold and Jonathan (right) celebrates with bronze in 2012\n\n'The Commonwealths is the main aim and I want to be part of it,' said Jonny.\n\n\n\n'It's once every four years, I've never been part of it before and to represent England would be amazing.'\n\n\n\nAlistair, whose ankle injury spoiled his 2013 season, said: 'The ankle seems pretty good and has done for a few months now.\n\n\n\n'But the world series is difficult to commit to and seems to get more difficult all the time.\n\n\n\n'One way to look at it is to target specific events instead and the Commonwealth Games is definitely one of them.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

Olympic Park", "text": "Harry, king of the swingers! Prince and Mayor Boris enjoy a playdate at the Olympic Park (but Mr Johnson swaps zip wire for rope bridge this year...)\n\nPrince Harry and Boris Johnson visited Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\n\n\nOfficially opens tomorrow\n\nPrince got involved while Boris took more of a backseat\n\nLast year, Boris got stuck on a zip wire in same place\n\nVisitors will also be able to view the interactive water fountains and an action-packed adventure playground\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell one\u2019s the king of the swingers \u2013 the other\u2019s a bungle VIP.\n\nBut Prince Harry proved to be just as good a sport as Boris Johnson yesterday, joining children at a new play area on the site of the Olympic Park.\n\nThe fourth-in-line to the throne laughed and joked as he tried out one of the swings. He was joined by the Mayor of London \u2013 next to the site of the botched Olympic zipwire stunt which left him dangling above a bemused crowd back in 2012.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\n\n\nHigh-flying Prince: London's newest, biggest green space received the Royal seal of approval today as Prince Harry and the Mayor of London Boris Johnson joined local youngsters for a sneak preview of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\nBig kid at heart: Harry, dressed in a smart suit, wasn't afraid of getting stuck in as he made his way across a wobbly bridge at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\n\nThe Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London, opens today and will include an action-packed adventure playground and interactive water fountains. Harry claimed the attraction was \u2018better than expected\u2019, saying: \u2018I think it\u2019s absolutely amazing. I can\u2019t wait to see it full of people.\u2019\n\nAnd the prince, 29, \u2013 who seemed to be following in his father and brother\u2019s footsteps, sporting a thinning patch of hair \u2013 added: \u2018People will be pouring through the place. The sun will be out. It will be the longest summer we\u2019ve ever had, I\u2019m sure.\u2019\n\nPrince Harry and Mr Johnson, both wearing navy suits, met outside the Aquatics Centre and began a walk around the park to meet local schoolchildren at the riverside play area and speak to the teams involved in transforming the area in the last 18 months.\n\nHarry chatted with schoolchildren and even pushed them on a swing while Boris watched from the sidelines. Perhaps he was afraid of making a fool of himself again after appearing on a zip wire above Victoria Park last year - the stunt did not exactly go to plan as the London Mayor was at one point left dangling helplessly above a bemused crowd.\n\nThe development has been led by the London Legacy Development Corporation.\n\n\n\nWhen Harry was asked if Prince George would visit the park in future years, he replied: 'I'm sure he'll have his chance to come down here.\n\n'You never know, the Olympics might be back here again before we know it.'\n\nOn hearing that remark, Mr Johnson joked: 'We'll put in for the Winter Games!'\n\n'Come on, Boris, give us a hand!' The Mayor leaves the fun to Prince Harry who plays on a swing with children at the new park 'I'll leave it to you, Harry' Boris cheers from the sidelines as Harry gets pushed in a giant swing by the excitable children Having a laugh: The prince and Mr Johnson, both wearing navy suits, met outside the Aquatics Centre and began a walk around the park to meet local schoolchildren Cautious: After Boris' zip wire incident last year, he nervously approaches the wobbly bridge Hurry up, Boris! The schoolchildren wait patiently as a nervous Boris makes his way across the rope bridge Nearly there! Boris salutes his fans as he smugly makes his way across the bridge in the playground Stuck again? Boris nervously clings to the rope as he cautiously makes his way across the bridge after his faux pas last year (right) Three cheers for Boris! Prince Harry leads the round of applause as Boris completes his walk across the rope bridge Concentration: Boris stares insistently at the finish line as he makes his way across the rope bridge. The ordeal was obviously too much and he suffered a wardrobe malfunction (right) Mr Johnson went on: 'It's far more beautiful than I possibly thought it could be. This is going to be a quite astonishing place to come and bring your family.' He added: 'We've got to be careful, some cities have had pretty bad experiences. 'But I think London is doing absolutely brilliantly and there's no question that I think most experts on Olympic legacy would say this was the best that any Olympic city has been able to do in such a short time.' The Prince and Mr Johnson met representatives from the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style championship for injured servicemen and women.\n\nSome of the events will take place in the park in September. The pair were then taken on a ride on mobility cycles with participants of Bikeworks, which helps people with disabilities. Harry rode on a bike with Terry Sullivan, 29, from the Isle of Dogs, east London, who steered them perilously close to a water fountain. He said afterwards: 'I loved it. I wanted to go into the water!' Dennis Hone, chief executive of the London Legacy Development Corporation, which manages the regeneration of the park, said the visit was a success. 'I think they stress-tested everything that we've got on the south plaza ready for its opening tomorrow,' he said. They gave it a thorough test and they seemed to enjoy it.\" The 376ft (114.5m) high ArcelorMittal Orbit lies at the centre of the new park and there will be future ventures with the Victoria and Albert Museum and University College London.

time-bomb", "text": "Britain's TOFI* kids health time-bomb: *That's Thin Outside but Fat Inside... and a MILLION 'fit' children face its hidden risks\n\nAcademics warn many inactive slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat\n\n\n\nOne million more kids are carrying too much fat around their internal organs\n\nOne in seven with 'healthy' BMI are at risk of developing life-limiting diseases\n\nOne million British children classed as healthy by the Government's official statistics are dangerously unfit, according to shocking new research.\n\n\n\nAcademics warn that an epidemic of inactivity means many slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat which puts them at risk of an early death from type 2 diabetes or heart disease.\n\nThey warn that a national schools strategy to monitor children's health is failing to identify many of those at risk because it does not officially class them as overweight.\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nAn epidemic of inactivity means many slim-looking children have 'hidden' fat which puts them at risk\n\nIt uses a measurement known as body mass index (BMI), which estimates the number of overweight or obese school-age children at about three million - nearly 30 per cent of all five- to 18-year-olds.\n\nBut the latest research, using a more accurate method to measure actual body fat, indicates one million more children are carrying too much fat around their internal organs.\n\nIt provides mounting evidence that Britain is facing a childhood obesity crisis - and suggests the Olympic legacy of 2012 is failing to create healthier and more active young people. The scientists have described a generation of 'Tofi' kids - who are 'Thin on the Outside, Fat on the Inside'.\n\nThey say as many as one in seven children recorded by schools as having a healthy BMI are at risk of developing life-limiting diseases.\n\nLast night, after being confronted with the research, Public Health Minister Jane Ellison admitted BMI 'isn't a perfect measure'.\n\nBut despite the evidence, officials say there are no plans to change the system.\n\n\n\nChild obesity expert Professor David McCarthy, of London Metropolitan University, who led the research, said the number of unfit youngsters had been 'clearly underestimated'.\n\n\n\nResearch indicates one million more children are carrying too much fat around their internal organs\n\nHe added: 'There's a raft of children who have been overlooked because they have a \u201chealthy\u201d BMI. This matters because the more fat you have, compared to muscle, the more likely you are to develop type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease in later life. If they maintain that body composition into adulthood, or it gets worse, they are going to be at high risk of these diseases.'\n\nThe National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), introduced in 2006, records children's height and weight at ages four to five, and again when they are ten and 11. These measurements produce a BMI for each child, which indicates whether they are within a healthy range or not. However, BMI is known to be poor at distinguishing between overweight children and those who are naturally muscular.\n\nAs a result of the programme, parents have received official letters warning them that their sporty, active children are overweight.\n\nIn the unpublished study of more than 1,000 children, Prof McCarthy used a Tanita 'bio-electrical impedance' machine that passes a low electrical current through the body to determine how much weight is fat and how much is muscle.\n\n'I can't think of a worse measurement than BMI'\n\nThe research found 15 per cent of those classed as having a healthy BMI carried high levels of fat, but low levels of muscle. One eight-year-old boy recorded a healthy BMI of 17.7 but was found to have 23 per cent body fat and low muscle mass.\n\nAnother boy, aged nine, had a healthy BMI of 19 but carried more than 28 per cent body fat, making him technically obese - despite not appearing overweight. Meanwhile, the study found one in ten children labelled overweight using BMI were healthy - equivalent to 300,000 children nationwide.\n\nProf McCarthy said: 'Many children find playing on the computer more enjoyable than hopscotch or tag, as they did 40 years ago. I think we have underestimated the importance of installing good physical activity habits early in life.'\n\nTam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'The NCMP is not producing a true and accurate picture of obesity in this country. We need to see inside children with sophisticated scientific equipment to find hidden fat - otherwise we are failing to address a growing problem.\n\n'There should be a scanning unit visiting schools, and children should be measured annually. We're making decisions on how to combat obesity based on inadequate information.'\n\nChild fitness expert Dr Gavin Sandercock, at Essex University, said: 'The least fit and healthy children in our studies are the ones who are underweight, not the overweight ones.\n\n\n\nProf McCarthy thinks we have underestimated the importance of installing good physical activity habits\n\nBMI isn't related to health at all - it's a height-to-weight ratio - and because it's so insensitive it's not fit for purpose. I can't think of a worse way to measure children's health. It fails them.'\n\nChildhood obesity is known to be a growing problem in the UK which has been blamed on poor diet and lack of exercise.\n\n\n\nOnce established, it is hard to treat - making early intervention more crucial. Overweight children are more likely to become obese adults and therefore have a higher risk of premature death, disability and long-term health problems. Most of the serious consequences will not develop until adulthood.\n\nThe NCMP is administered by Public Health England. Dr Ann Hoskins, director of children, young people and families, said: 'We have to look at the totality of evidence, which concludes the BMI Centile is the most suitable indicator of body fat and overall weight in childhood.'\n\nMinister Jane Ellison said: 'We know BMI isn't a perfect measure but it is recognised internationally as the most reliable way to estimate body mass. It is recommended by the World Health Organisation.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/04/26149576-0-image-m-35_1584592153582.jpg",

Olympics", "text": "Sport in schools has slumped despite Coalition promises to create an Olympic legacy through education, new figures have suggested.\n\nPupils spend less time in sport and PE lessons now than four years ago despite a drive to \u2018inspire a generation\u2019 to become more active following the London 2012 games.\n\nThe average number of minutes of PE offered to pupils in England has dropped to well below two hours per week, according to a survey by the Youth Sport Trust.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe drive to \u2018inspire a generation\u2019 to become more active following the London 2012 Olympic Games is failing\n\nStudents spend less time in PE lessons like gymnastics now than they did four years ago (posed for picture)\n\nPupils aged five to seven spend just an hour and 42 minutes per week in PE lessons \u2013 nearly 25 minutes less than in 2010.\n\nThe findings, coupled with soaring obesity rates among youngsters, paint a \u2018bleak and worrying\u2019 picture, according to Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the YST.\n\nThe figures prompted head teachers to warn of an \u2018inactivity crisis\u2019 and call on ministers to make school sport a \u2018real priority\u2019.\n\nThe Coalition came under intense pressure over its strategy for delivering an Olympic legacy after it scrapped \u00a3162million of ring-fenced cash for school sport.\n\nIt also allowed schools to drop a target to offer at least two hours of PE a week and agreed to the sale of some school playing fields against the advice of its own panel of experts.\n\nIn a partial U-turn, the Government unveiled a \u00a3150million-a-year PE and sports premium for primary schools, which David Cameron last year committed to continue funding until 2020.\n\nReversing the growing levels of physical inactivity amongst young people is a seismic challenge Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust\n\nThe apparent decline in school sport emerged in the biggest survey of its kind since the Coalition controversially scrapped an annual national study on sport provision, last undertaken in 2009/10.\n\nResponses from 1,392 primary schools and 554 secondaries showed that five to seven-year-olds spend an average of 102 minutes in PE lessons \u2013 compared to 126 minutes in the 2009/10 survey.\n\nAmong seven to 11-year-olds, 114 minutes are spent in PE \u2013 down from 127 minutes recorded four years ago. A similar drop was seen among pupils aged 11 to 14, although levels of sport appeared to rise among 14 to 18-year-olds.\n\nThe survey also showed a decline in the number of links between schools and community sports clubs since 2010.\n\nSebastian Coe was rewarded for his success in organising the 2012 Games by being appointed the Prime Minister\u2019s Olympics legacy ambassador in August 2012. The average number of minutes of PE offered to pupils in England has dropped to well below two hours per week since that time\n\nGreat Britain's Tom Daley training at the Aquatics Centre in the Olympic Park in London in July 2012. A study shows pupils aged five to seven now spend nearly 25 minutes less per week in PE lesson than in 2010\n\nThe YST admitted it was difficult to make direct comparisons with the 2009/10 Government study, which had covered virtually all schools in the country, but insisted its data was \u2018statistically reliable\u2019.\n\nThe charity launched a manifesto yesterday calling for more lesson time to be devoted to PE and \u2018sustained competitive sport in schools\u2019.\n\nBaroness Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust, said the level of physical activity in primary schools paints a 'bleak and worrying picture'\n\nBaroness Campbell said: \u2018Reversing the growing levels of physical inactivity amongst young people is a seismic challenge.\n\n\u2018With one in three children leaving primary school obese or overweight, and less than one in five meeting the minimum recommended guidelines for physical activity, it is a bleak and worrying picture.\u2019\n\nThe charity also pointed to research suggesting that plenty of physical activity can lead to improvements in academic achievement.\n\nBaroness Campbell went on: \u2018We have set out where we believe any future government should focus its efforts if we are to stand any real chance of reversing the worrying trends that are leading to increasing sedentary lifestyles amongst young people.\u2019\n\nThe Department for Education said that last year it commissioned its own survey of 586 primary schools which showed their pupils spent an average of 122 minutes each week doing PE, up 13 minutes on 2013.\n\nA DfE spokesman said: \u2018As part of our plan for education, we want children to get into the habit of playing and enjoying sport \u2013 both in lessons and after school.\n\n'That\u2019s why we are giving primary school headteachers over \u00a3450 million of funding to spend on improving PE \u2013 and our own research shows they are using it to deliver more and better sport.\n\n\u2018Our findings show that primary schools are delivering more than two hours of PE each week, and it has increased by an average of 13 minutes in the last year; 83 per cent of schools also reported an increase in participation in after-hours sports since the introduction of the funding.", "images":

people give up swimming", "text": "Swimming has seen a huge fall in participation numbers over the last year with 245,000 fewer people taking part in the sport.\n\nFunding body Sport England says it is disappointed and concerned at swimming's eight per cent drop which has significantly affected overall participation numbers in sport.\n\nOverall, there has been a 125,100 fall in participation in sport in England according to the latest Active People's Survey - so swimming has wiped out increased experience in other sports including athletics as well as team sports such as football and cricket.\n\nThe London Aquatics Centre in Stratford, which was built for the 2012 Olympics\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron at the London Aquatics Centre during the 2012 games\n\nRebecca Adlington smiles after winning the 800m freestyle final at the 2012 games in London\n\nIn the year ending October 2014, 125,100 fewer people did some kind of sport once a week for 30 minutes - bringing the overall number down from 15.7million to 15.6m.\n\nSwimming is still the country's most popular sport with over 2.6m people taking part weekly despite the drop, which is certain to lead to a funding cut.\n\nSports minister Helen Grant, said: 'There are 1.6 million more people playing sport regularly now than when we won the right to host the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2005 and I am encouraged that the number of 16-25 year olds participating is on the rise - proof that our youth sport strategy is working.", "images":

"date": "29/01/2015"}, "rank_24": {"title": "Olympic legacy at risk after 222,000 Brits turn their backs on sport in last six months", "text": "The most damning indictment indictment yet of the so-called Olympic legacy is contained within new figures showing sport participation figures continuing on a downward spiral.\n\nThree years after the staging of the London Olympics which cost the country \u00a39billion and were sold partly with a pledge of \u2018inspiring a new generation to greater sporting activity,\u2019 there is scant evidence it has done anything of the sort.\n\nIn fact Sport England figures show fewer people are playing sport than ever before with just 15.5milliion participating in any kind of sport once a month, a 222,000 drop in the last six months.\n\nRebecca Adlington inspired Brits in 2012, but swimming has seen the biggest drop in numbers\n\nThe decline in participation was branded \u2018disastrous,\u2019 by Labour\u2019s shadow sports minister Clive Efford who said a long-term plan rather than a \u2018sticking plaster\u2019 was required. They newly elected sports minister Tracey Crouch promised to deliver one \u2018as a matter of urgency.\u2019\n\nBut the Conservative government are likely to be the target of much ire given the latest figures indicated the biggest decline in participation is in sports like swimming which rely heavily on local government facilities, where budgets have been slashed in recent years.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m very disappointed by these numbers,\u2019 said Crouch, who took up her post after last month\u2019s general election, \u2018A significant amount of public funding has been invested in sport in the last decade but the results simply aren\u2019t good enough. The recent downward trend in participation has demonstrated that the current approach has had its day.\n\n'I am going to develop a new strategy for sport, as a matter of urgency. I will consult with the sector on a new approach that will strengthen sport across the country, focus support on those that can deliver the goods and look to take a more joined-up approach to sport and physical activity.\u2019\n\nNew sports minister Tracey Crouch (centre) has promised to deliver a long-term plan to reverse the trend\n\nWhile swimming remains the country\u2019s most popular sport with over 2.5million people taking part weekly, numbers are dwindling with 390,700 fewer people taking to the pool in the last year and a 729,000 drop over the last decade.\n\n\u2018There has been an increase in open water and outdoor swimming, as well as organised aquatic sports, which are all positives for the future,\u2019 said Adam Parker, Chairman of the Amateur Swimming Association, \u2018But we also have to ensure swimming remains appealing and accessible to those who swim now.\u2019\n\nThe statistics, which cover the period from October 2014 to March 2015 also show a drastic decline in keep fit and gym sector. The drop of 153,000 was the first dip in numbers since the organisation started counting.\n\nWhile there were increases recorded in numbers playing tennis and basketball and figures remained stable for team sports, Jennie Price, Chief Executive of Sport England admitted the findings of the Active People Survey made for grim reading.\n\n\u2018These are really disappointing results,\u2019 she said, \u2018This is especially the case for swimming, where a serious, long-term decline needs to be reversed. We have already started working with a wider range of partners and will be looking further at with whom we work, and what we invest in, to get more people playing sport.\u2019\n\nThere has never been any evidence that hosting an Olympic Games results in an upturn in sport participation figures but that did not stop then Prime Minister Tony Blair making grand claims when lobbying the International Olympic Committee for votes in 2005. A home Olympics would \u2018see millions more young people in Britain and across the world participating in sport and improving their lives,\u2019 he said.\n\nThe \u00a3429m Olympic Stadium has cost another \u00a3160m to convert for West Ham to move into next year\n\nIn fact, it is following a similar path to the legacy left by the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002. A report commissioned by UK Sport two years later showed concluded that the \u2018games appear to have had no impact on sport participation levels.\u2019", "images":

"date": "11/06/2015"}, "rank_69": {"title": "Nation must hope and pray that Mo Farah's only error is being absent-minded", "text": "The world of athletics was lining up to explain how easy it is to miss a drugs test. Doesn\u2019t make you a cheat, they said. Doesn\u2019t mean you dope. And of course it doesn\u2019t. Then again, it doesn\u2019t make you innocent either.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with a miss. You never know. Nothing can be presumed. That\u2019s why the athletics authorities take it so seriously.\n\nThe myth is that a missed test is common. It suits those who miss to say that. But it isn\u2019t. In 2010, for instance, there were 394 athletes in the National Registered Testing Pool. They would each be tested three times a year minimum, and as many as nine times maximum.\n\nScroll down to video\n\nMo Farah posted this picture on social media with the double Olympic champion trains in the south of France\n\nFarah returned to the track where he won double Olympic gold in 2013 to launch the Anniversary Games\n\nLet\u2019s allow for a conservative ball park average of five tests per individual. So that works out as 1,970 NRTP tests a year. And how many were missed? Just 43. So this isn\u2019t something that happens to many athletes once, let alone twice. This isn\u2019t routine.\n\nThere was a worrying spike in whereabouts offences by British athletes in the year before the London Olympic Games, too. Meaning a missed test is a big deal, and just one can incur a ban, if the anti-doping legislators believe an athlete has been deliberately evasive.\n\nSo Mo Farah isn\u2019t subject to some irrational witch-hunt. He isn\u2019t being pursued or bullied. This is not tall poppy syndrome, build \u2018em up to knock \u2018em down. He works with a coach, Alberto Salazar, who has a queue of athletes and coaches making accusations against him. This led to the revelation that Farah missed a date with the testers twice prior to the 2012 Olympic Games. That isn\u2019t a meaningless development, either.\n\nAnxious emails were sent warning of the dire consequences of a third no-show; Farah\u2019s agent Ricky Simms went to significant lengths to dispute the second miss on the grounds his client hadn\u2019t heard his doorbell. All of this indicates a developing crisis treated with huge significance at the time. And if it was big for Farah then, it most certainly is for British athletics and the Olympic movement now.\n\nAlberto Salazar has been accused of doping by a raft of former athletes and coaches\n\nFarah celebrates after adding the European 5,000m title to his trophy cabinet last year\n\nFarah and his Team GB colleagues are all that remain in terms of 2012 Olympic legacy. The bold predictions of a revitalised healthy nation have crumbled.\n\nFond memories alone are left and any suspicion around Farah threatens that happy state. Missed tests, by definition, cast doubt.\n\nThe latest figures from Sport England make depressing reading. In the last six months, 250,000 people have dropped out of sports participation. The anticipated spike in activity that would be London\u2019s legacy never materialised.\n\nSwimming is down 144,200, and closer to 160,000 no longer visit a gym. Hell, Britain can\u2019t even keep its citizens interested in Zumba classes, considering dance-related fitness has also taken a hit. The cycling boom has peaked \u2014 down by over 40,000 \u2014 and the biggest racket sport, badminton, is not far behind.\n\nStadium legacy is equally elusive. A football club has claimed the Olympic arena, other structures have been dismantled and reduced, and the diversion of capital to the capital has actually helped forced the closure of some facilities in the regions.\n\nSo it\u2019s the sport. That is what is left. It was a marvellous party, and we loved every minute of it. Farah was at the heart of that, from his gold medal on Super Saturday to his heart-stopping triumph in the 5,000 metres a week later, arguably the run of his life.\n\nHe was Britain\u2019s athlete of the games, a long-distance runner capable of outlasting the East Africans, a competitor of incredible resolve and courage, with a back story that encapsulated all that was positive about modern Britain.\n\nA school age refugee from Somalia, who arrived speaking little English and at first struggled to assimilate, his rise to become the greatest long distance runner of his time was a tale of true inspiration. It was this country\u2019s equivalent of the American dream \u2014 anybody can be anybody, with enough drive and determination. It is no exaggeration to describe Farah as a national hero.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron poses with Farah outside No 10 Downing Street after his 5,000m Olympic win\n\nSpectators perform the Mobot at the Anniversary Games in 2013 to salute their hero\n\nAnd now? He is still. He has never been banned, he has never failed a drugs test, the allegations against his coach are yet to touch him, directly. There are plenty ready to vouch for Farah, to claim he is the innocent party, unjustly tainted by association. Yet it isn\u2019t good. This isn\u2019t good.\n\nThere are 16 witnesses making allegations against Salazar, his coach, with tales of testosterone and clear vials.\n\nThere are two confirmed missed tests, aberrations from a time when Farah\u2019s standing in the sport was improving, rapidly. And there is an explanation around a muffled doorbell ring that suggests, far from being wrongly besmirched, Farah was treated quite leniently by the authorities.\n\nHe was at home in Teddington when the testers called in 2011. His house was not huge. They rang the doorbell, which he said was hard to hear from his bedroom. Simms made a video attempting to prove this. And, of course, it is a plausible explanation. A person doesn\u2019t always hear the bell at home, or even a knock at the door.\n\nMo Farah's agent, Ricky Simms, made a video inside the athlete's house in Teddington, London to try to show why he failed to hear the doorbell from his upstairs bedroom (above) when the drug testers called in 2011\n\nAfter entering the house Simms filmed as he went up some stairs to the first-floor living/trophy room (above) where the doorbell sound was clearly audible\n\nSimms then climbed some more stairs and passed an altitude machine (above) before entering Farah\u2019s second-floor bedroom. The doorbell is barely audible\n\nYet testers don\u2019t ring once and depart. They hang around, for the allotted hour the athlete is supposed to be available. They knock. They try again.\n\nThe reason Simms was so impassioned in making Farah\u2019s case, is that holing up in a room that made it difficult to hear the bell might fall into the dangerous category of evasion.\n\nWithout doubt, this second missed test could have been taken further had Farah\u2019s explanation not been indulged. The second missed test wasn\u2019t discounted, but nor was it played up into something more serious.\n\nFor now, there are the memories. Farah, out on his own on Super Saturday, Farah, holding off a pack of menacing rivals to complete a double in the 5,000 metres, Farah and Usain Bolt swapping poses, the Mobot and the archer. The Olympic Stadium was never louder, more impassioned than for Farah\u2019s second gold. It was as charged as Sydney was for Cathy Freeman or Ian Thorpe. That noise, that fervour, is our legacy. This was the best we could be.\n\nAn overjoyed Farah crosses the line to win the 5,000m title to complete a long-distance Olympic double\n\nFarah and Usain Bolt share a moment during medal presentations during the euphoria of London 2012\n\n\u2018A missed test doesn\u2019t mean you are doping,\u2019 said Olympic medallist Kelly Sotherton. \u2018It doesn\u2019t make you a drugs cheat.\u2019\n\nBut there was a caveat. \u2018If you make a mistake once, most athletes learn from it,\u2019 she said.", "images":

of converting the Olympic Stadium into a new home for West Ham has risen to \u00a3272million, rocketing the overall cost of the project to \u00a3701m.\n\nA 'fixed' conversion fee of \u00a3154m was originally agreed by London Legacy Development Corporation with constructor Balfour Beatty, but a rise in costs to \u00a3189.9m was announced in October and it has now emerged the final figure is even higher.\n\nIn the bid for the London 2012 Games, the Olympic Stadium cost was put at \u00a3280m, but the final construction price tag was \u00a3429m.\n\nScroll down to video\n\nWest Ham's newly-appointed manager Slaven Bilic pictured at their soon-to-be Olympic Stadium home\n\nThe move overseen by West Ham co-owners David Sullivan (left), David Gold (right) and vice-chairman Karren Brady (centre) has cost over \u00a3118million more than was first expected from Upton Park\n\nWest Ham will move into the 54,000-seater venue at Stratford for the start of the 2016/2017 season, and will pay a contribution of some \u00a315m as well as a \u00a32.5m annual rent on a 99-year lease, while British Athletics are entitled to host 20 days per annum.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium will boast the world's largest cantilevered roof, coming at a cost of some \u00a3193.9m, with some 21,000 moveable seats. It will hold the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games next month as well as Rugby World Cup matches in September and the Race of Champions motorsport event at the multi-use arena.\n\nThe breakdown of the funding showed some \u00a3148.8m in 2010 from corporate social responsibility settlement and 'income generated on the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park through land sales and profits from venues'. Newham Council contributed \u00a340m, the Government \u00a325m and UK Athletics \u00a31m. There was \u00a338.7m from the Games Public Sector Funding Package and \u00a33.5m from the London Marathon Charitable Trust.\n\nLocal school clubs will be given year-round access to the new floodlit 400 metres track, with a training and education centre in the stadium, which will offer up to 100,000 free tickets every year for Newham residents at West Ham matches.\n\nChief executive of the LLDC David Goldstone is confident the commercial deals in place will mean the Olympic Stadium should not require further public money.\n\n'We have invested in transforming a temporary athletics venue into a permanent world-class multi-use arena that has a secure and long-term sustainable future. This has required a significant amount of work and innovative engineering solutions,' Goldstone said.\n\n'Alongside the transformation work the deals signed with British Athletics and West Ham United and the appointment of a stadium operator ensures the stadium will pay its way and not require any continuing subsidy from the taxpayer.'\n\nLondon Major Boris Johnson believes the final project is the best outcome.\n\nThe vast Olympic Stadium was so iconic during the successful London 2012 Games\n\nHe said in a statement: 'A very bad call was made when those in charge at the time backed a stadium construction plan that would leave the Olympic Park with a much smaller, mouldering and tumbleweed ridden arena following the Games,' Johnson said.\n\n'Following that plan would have literally torn the heart out of the park and put at risk the incredible economic regeneration we are now seeing in east London.\n\n'Our remedy offered long-term sustainable investment in order to protect an iconic stadium that Londoners took to their hearts, and which is now set to be home to almost every conceivable sport, concert or community event for decades to come.\n\n'We've created a knockout venue that will drive and sustain thousands of jobs, where we've ensured that a hefty share of the profits will be paid back into the taxpayers coffers and which provides a genuine Olympic legacy for our city.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

candidate, part of the team that helped secure the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games for the capital, branded the coalition government 'wicked and negligent'.\n\nWhile the regeneration of east London

Olympic legacy of wider participation in sport has been 'squandered'\n\nTessa Jowell, part of the team that helped secure the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games for London, branded the coalition government 'wicked and negligent'\n\nSport England's latest figures from April 2015 suggested the number of people over 16 participating in sport at least once a week stood at 15.49million, down from 15.89million in October 2012\n\nSport England's latest figures from April 2015 suggested the number of people over 16 participating in sport at least once a week stood at 15.49 million, down from 15.89 million in October 2012.\n\nA total of 1.4 million more people have been playing sport since the first year of Sport England's Active People Survey 2005/06, when the Olympics were secured.\n\nDame Tessa told the Guardian: 'Instead of a generation of children being transformed by sport, a generation of children have been robbed of the chance to discover a sport they're really good at.\n\n'We were on track. It was absolutely, wholly and solely their fault. It was going to be delivered. We were on course to deliver it as the figures make absolutely clear. Whenever I think about it, it makes me furious that this opportunity was squandered. My fury is on behalf of all those who were starting secondary schools five years ago.\n\nLast month Boris Johnson, pictured with Jowell in 2012, defended the Government's record in the Commons\n\n'I hope this is a huge stain on their consciences. When we get to Tokyo (in 2020) I think it likely we'll be back to half our medalists being from independent schools. It doesn't mean they're great athletes.\n\n'There are fewer people now playing sport. It is on the conscience of those ministers.'\n\nIn her interview with the Guardian she pointed the finger at Michael Gove, who was education secretary from 2010 to 2014, for cutting \u00a3162m in ringfenced funding for school sport, calling the move a 'small decision with huge consequences'.\n\nLast month Boris Johnson defended the Government's record in the Commons, saying all major venues had been or were set to be opened to the public and the private investment in London which followed the games had ensured 'a phenomenal legacy'.\n\nLord Coe, the chairman of London 2012, believes a wider view needs to be taken.\n\nLord Coe (right), chairman of London 2012, believes a wider view needs to be taken to improve participation\n\nWriting in the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'There is much wailing and gnashing of teeth whenever Sport England releases its latest participation figures. I believe there is little value in looking at the figures in six-monthly chunks, let us look across 10-year cycles.\n\n'Pre-2005 there is little doubt sport participation was declining and had been for a long time, particularly amongst young people. Since bidding for the Games, that trend has reversed. In the past 10 years of the Active People survey, 1.4 million more people are doing sport at least once a week.", "images":

extend Olympic legacy\n\nBolt is preparing for the World Championships in Beijing in August\n\nUsain Bolt will be back at London's Olympic Stadium this summer after agreeing to run the 100m at the Anniversary Games at the end of the month.\n\nThe world's fastest man will return to the scene of his 2012 triumphs, when he won gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay, in what is a significant coup for British Athletics.\n\nThe Jamaican star has pulled out of recent Diamond League races in Lausanne and Paris, but is set to run on British soil as he tests his fitness ahead of the World Championships in Beijing in August.\n\nUsain Bolt will be back at London's Olympic Stadium after agreeing to run the 100m at the Anniversary Games\n\nBolt has been convinced to return to London for the Anniversary Games after recent UK income tax changes\n\n'London is a special place where I love to compete and I am looking forward to the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games on July 24,' he said.\n\n'I have great memories of competing in the Olympic Stadium in the summer of 2012 and in the previous Grand Prix meets in London.\n\n'The British fans are always great and I expect there will also be a lot of Jamaican fans in the stadium.\n\n'It will be amazing to put on another great show for them under the floodlights on the Friday night.'\n\nBolt ran at the 2013 Anniversary Games, but did not return last year when no tax break was offered\n\nBolt triumphed at the London Olympic's in 2012 after winning gold in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay\n\nChancellor George Osborne waived UK income tax for athletes based overseas in this week's budget; a move which was enough to entice Bolt to come back to London.\n\nHe declined an invitation to compete last year when the event was held in Glasgow because no tax break scheme was in place, although he did run at the Commonwealth Games in the city two weeks later, where competitors were granted tax exemption.\n\nBolt, 29, did not compete in the UK in 2010 or 2011 as non-resident athletes are liable for 50 per cent tax on their appearance fee, plus a proportion of their worldwide earnings.\n\nThe Jamaican has struggled this year and was forced to pull out of national trials with a knee injury\n\nThe Jamaican has struggled for form this season, failing to break 20 seconds for 200m or 10 seconds for 100m and did not run in his national trials two weeks ago.\n\nBut he remains the biggest draw in athletics and his presence in London will give a huge boost to event organisers, especially as they are struggling to sell tickets for the Friday night session of the three-day event.\n\nBolt will also avoid having to go head-to-head again the quickest man in the world so far this year, Justin Gatlin, ahead of the World Championships because Anniversay Games organisers have made it quite clear the American is not welcome at the meeting owing to his two previous failed drugs tests.", "images":

to the shrieks of joyriders on the Shark Bite rollercoaster and children frolicking excitedly in the dancing fountains.\n\nFamilies share picnics and pose for selfies against the backdrop of the iconic stadium where Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah triumphed on that euphoric night three years ago.\n\nThey should take their souvenir photographs and enjoy the easy ambience while they can. The park won\u2019t be the same for much longer.\n\nIn a few weeks\u2019 time, preparations will begin for the Olympic stadium to be handed over to its new tenant, West Ham United Football Club, and it will be transformed into a brash Premier League citadel, packed from August to May with 54,000 rowdy fans.\n\nThe club\u2019s owners, sex industry tycoons David Gold and David Sullivan, describe the makeover that will precede their four-mile migration from their antiquated ground in Upton Park as the \u2018West Hamification\u2019 process.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nVictors: David Gold, Lady Brady and David Sullivan pictured at the Olympic Stadium\n\nHaving been converted for football at a cost to the taxpayer of \u00a3257 million, with the club paying just \u00a315 million, the venue that witnessed British Olympic history being made will be daubed with the team\u2019s claret and blue colours and the logos of such sponsors as online bookmakers Betway.\n\nIn the West Stand, there will be a \u2018hospitality and entertainment experience\u2019 called Club London, where the wealthier fans and celebrities can quaff champagne and nibble canapes and watch matches without having to rub shoulders with the hoi-polloi.\n\nBy paying between \u00a360 and \u00a3499, supporters can even purchase granite stones inscribed with their names and slogans declaring their undying loyalty to the club \u2014 \u2018Bob and Betty: True Hammers For Ever\u2019 perhaps \u2014 that will form part of a huge mosaic which is to be laid beside the stadium.\n\nYet this garish makeover of this hallowed sporting venue is not the most troubling aspect of the controversial decision to lease the Olympic stadium to West Ham.\n\nWhat concerns many is the extraordinarily favourable financial deal which was wrung from the London Legacy Development Corporation, the public body whose job it is to manage the transformation of the Olympic Park, by West Ham United\u2019s vice-chairman Karren Brady.\n\nMs Brady, who is a long-time acolyte of pornographer Mr Sullivan, has \u2014 it must be noted \u2014 recently been ennobled by David Cameron, who also appointed her as a small business ambassador.\n\nIt was she who played a leading role in negotiating the terms of the 207-page leasehold contract between the club and the Legacy corporation; a document shrouded in such secrecy it arguably defies a fundamental tenet of democracy: the public\u2019s right to know how its money is spent.\n\nMore than a decade ago, when London beat Paris, Madrid, Moscow and others to secure the 2012 Games, nobody envisaged the legacy would be to revive the fortunes of a near-bankrupt football club and further enrich two men who made millions by bringing sex shops and pornography to our High Streets.\n\nAmid the rhetoric espoused by bid leader Lord Coe, among others, there was no mention of the benefits that might accrue to football for this would hardly have helped to sway the International Olympic Committee.\n\nInstead, the mantra was that London 2012 would be a positive catalyst for social change, improving the lot of ordinary people in the most deprived part of the capital.\n\nCentral to this grandiose aim were the plans for the showpiece new stadium, designed specifically for athletics, in the expectation of enticing thousands to watch and participate in this Cinderella sport.\n\nWe must presume that the architects of London\u2019s bid genuinely believed the arena could stage sufficient crowd-pulling athletics events to pay its way. If so, they were hopelessly na\u00efve.\n\nThe other possibility is that they secretly knew that only a big-time football club could fill the new stadium, the cost of which spiralled from the original estimate of \u00a3280 million to \u00a3429 million, but did not dare to admit as much for fear that this would not chime with the Olympic spirit.\n\nIn which case, they were deeply disingenuous, for principle gave way to harsh economic reality long before the Games opened, as the stadium was put out to tender and, inevitably, football clubs muscled in.\n\nWinner: Jessica Ennis-Hill celebrates gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games in London\n\nAfter a bidding process more bitterly fought than the battle to stage the Olympics themselves, West Ham beat Tottenham Hotspur and East London minnows Leyton Orient to win the concession.\n\nTo Andrew Boff, Tory leader in the London Assembly, the plan put forward by Spurs (demolish the stadium and build one designed for football) would have been the best option for taxpayers because it would have spared them the \u00a3257 million conversion cost.\n\nFurthermore, he argues, while the stadium is described as iconic, with its unlovely, Meccano- like structure \u2018it has little architectural merit\u2019.\n\nAs Mr Boff says, it would have taken a brave politician to order the setting for our finest sporting spectacle to be bulldozed.\n\nHowever, he described the West Ham deal to me this week as \u2018incredibly suspect\u2019; not because he suspects for one minute it was in any way corrupt but because he believes it was concocted to ensure the stadium was preserved despite the vast cost, thus sparing the blushes of those who championed it.\n\nThis, needless to say, is not a view shared by the Legacy corporation and West Ham.\n\nThey insist that the deal, which will give the club a 99-year lease but allow for other occasional sporting and entertainment events, with a share of the profits being paid into the public purse, represents very good value for the taxpayer.\n\n\u2018A Premier League football tenant will drive millions of visitors to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, maintaining a global profile that will attract many income-raising opportunities,\u2019 the Legacy corporation said in a statement this week.\n\nWest Ham, for its part, claimed the move would create 700 jobs, bring a million more people (its fans) to the Park each year and \u2018add value to any sponsorship and commercial agreements relating to the stadium which the public purse will benefit from\u2019.\n\nPresumably this covers the naming rights to the stadium, which is expected to be rechristened, doubtless to advertise some giant foreign enterprise, in the near future.\n\nIn short, the club argues that if it wasn\u2019t moving in, the Olympic stadium would become a loss- making white elephant.\n\nThe fireworks erupt at the Olympic Opening Ceremony during London 2012\n\nPerhaps. The big question is: what will the taxpaying public gain in return for stumping up virtually the entire cost of building and reconfiguring the stadium? That will amount to \u00a3701 million by the time West Ham takes occupancy.\n\nAfter pressure from concerned parties, the weighty contract documenting the deal was recently released under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nYet so many of its clauses have been redacted that, in the words of Richard Hunt of the Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust (which vehemently opposes the deal because of the detrimental effect it could have on other London football clubs such as theirs), there is \u2018a sea of black ink\u2019 covering sections of the text.\n\nThe trust has complained to the Information Commissioner about this secrecy, requested by the Legacy corporation on the grounds that revealing contractual details would be commercially damaging. A ruling is expected later this month.\n\nHowever, according to the sports promoter Barry Hearn, who, as owner until last year of Leyton Orient FC fought against West Ham\u2019s tenancy of the Olympic stadium, we already know enough about the arrangement to see how the taxpayer is being fleeced.\n\nThis is the worst-negotiated deal since the North American Indians gave up their land for a handful of trinkets Sports promoter, Barry Hearn\n\n\u2018This is the worst-negotiated deal since the North American Indians gave up their land for a handful of trinkets,\u2019 Hearn told me this week. Judging by the generous terms set out in the contract\u2019s few un-redacted passages, it is difficult to argue.\n\nIt states that the London Legacy Development Corporation will foot West Ham\u2019s bills for a wide range of services normally paid for by football clubs, from match-day security to ticketing, pitch maintenance, lighting and heating bills, and even the maintenance of fans\u2019 lavatories. Astonishingly, the publicly funded landlords will even pick up the tab for the nets and the corner-flags!\n\nBy the way, West Ham could afford to splash out \u00a333 million on new players last year and, despite the confines of its old ground, it declared a pre-tax profit of \u00a315.3 million.\n\nThe Legacy Corporation and club would have us believe this generosity is par for the course. \u2018If you hire a badminton court at the local leisure centre you wouldn\u2019t expect to provide your own net,\u2019 is how it was blithely explained to me this week.\n\nHowever, the deal Baroness Brady has secured appears to be one of the greatest contractual coups in sporting history. Though it will transform West Ham\u2019s future at the stroke of a pen, Barry Hearn believes that the club is effectively getting the stadium free.\n\nThis is because the annual rent, believed to be no more than \u00a32.5 million (less should the club be relegated from the Premier League), will be more than offset by the costs to be paid by the Legacy corporation, he says. Then there are the millions West Ham will receive every year from corporate hospitality. Other reports suggest it will get a slice of the catering revenues, too.\n\nExamining those parts of the contract we are permitted to see, I also found a clause that hints at lucrative rights West Ham has won. As it will run the stadium\u2019s only merchandise store, it will not only be authorised to sell football-related products but clothes, souvenirs and memorabilia for the IAAF World Athletics Championships to be staged there in 2017.\n\nPresumably this will apply to other major events and the club will no doubt demand a healthy cut of the profits.\n\nAn aerial view across London and of the Olympic Park in Stratford, featuring the Olympic Stadium\n\nHowever, it is the many clauses which are obliterated by black ink that should worry us most, for who knows what other little sweeteners the astute First Lady of Football has elicited for her paymasters?\n\nThough Gold and Sullivan have vowed never to sell West Ham, insisting it will be their children\u2019s legacy, the undeniable possibility remains that they will be tempted by the riches of some Middle Eastern sheik or Russian oligarch.\n\nAfter all, as Barry Hearn says, the Qataris already own a sizeable chunk of the Olympic village and the stadium \u2018would complete the jigsaw\u2019. They toured the stadium before the Games and were interested in naming rights.\n\nOn the back of the stadium deal, analysts say West Ham\u2019s value has soared at least fourfold, from \u00a3105 million in 2010, when the two businessman bought their controlling stake, to more than \u00a3400 million.\n\nWere they to cash in their chips, what proportion of the sale price (if any) could be clawed back by the public? This is one of many secrets contained in the contract which patently ought to be uncovered.\n\nChris Bryant, Shadow Secretary for culture, media and sport, suggests the deal might be so loaded in West Ham\u2019s favour that it breaches European Commission rules, since it could hand the club an unfair, state-aided advantage over competitors in the football business.\n\nFor instance, because West Ham\u2019s stadium costs will be so low, they will be able to reduce seating prices and \u2018dump\u2019 thousands of tickets (100,000 are to be handed to Newham Council each season for distribution among the community) thus attracting thousands of new fans who might otherwise have chosen to watch, say, Arsenal.\n\nNevertheless, Sullivan, 66, who began life on a Cardiff council estate and is now said to be worth \u00a3850 million, and Gold, 79, who as a boy peddled buttons on the streets of West Ham and has built a \u00a3350 million fortune, are convinced that the relocation is \u2018a game-changer\u2019, to quote the club\u2019s website.\n\nThey can see it catapulting the team they have supported since their East End boyhood to the summit of world football alongside the likes of Manchester United.\n\nThe pair have further lined their pockets by selling Upton Park to property developers Galliard Homes.\n\nIt is not known how much they received, though the ground was valued in recent accounts at more than \u00a370 million.\n\nGalliard has submitted plans to build 838 apartments there, just six per cent of which would be \u2018affordable housing\u2019 within the price range of ordinary East Enders.\n\nNewham\u2019s Mayor, Sir Robin Wales, has warned Galliard that is \u2018totally unacceptable\u2019 but it is feared that most of the flats will be so expensive they will be bought by overseas investors.\n\nAgain, this is hardly in keeping with the promises made in the Olympic legacy.\n\nThere are other key players in this darkly intriguing tale, prominent among them London Mayor Boris Johnson, who was in many ways the public face of the Games, who has ignored the misgivings of fellow Tories in the Assembly to give the secret deal his blessing.\n\nBarry Hearn believes that if the censor\u2019s black ink is removed, Boris\u2019s stance will be proved so ill-judged that it could even damage his prime ministerial ambitions.\n\nMeanwhile, we can but wonder how taxpayer-funded goalposts replaced the lofty goals that were to have been the legacy of London 2012.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

says West Ham took over the house nobody wanted", "text": "Karren Brady is standing on the touchline of what, next season, will be West Ham\u2019s pitch when she cuts to the heart of the matter.\n\n\u2018You see,\u2019 she says, looking around an arena now readying itself for the Rugby World Cup, \u2018anyone could have bought this. Leyton Orient, the Qataris, anyone. But nobody saw it, nobody saw the potential here. So roll back that movie without West Ham. Taxpayers\u2019 money would have poured into a big hole, been concreted over and never seen again.\n\n\u2018Now the stadium is nearly finished, everyone recognises what is here and says it\u2019s a steal. But it wasn\u2019t a steal when we were doing the negotiations, because where was the queue of rival buyers? Without West Ham this would have been pulled down. It was going to be 25,000 with no roof.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nKarren Brady speaks to Sportsmail's Martin Samuel about West Ham's move to the Olympic Stadium\n\nBrady has spearheaded West Ham's move from Upton Park to the Olympic Stadium, scheduled for 2016\n\nBrady believes that West Ham were the first organisation to realise the potential of moving into the stadium\n\nWest Ham will look to fill the Olympic Stadium with 54,000 supporters for each home league encounter\n\n\u2018And what would have happened then? Who would have come to that stadium? That\u2019s a legacy? Tottenham just wanted to flatten it and start again. So no Olympic Stadium at all. This is going to be an asset, a national asset. We shouldn\u2019t have to keep justifying ourselves.\u2019\n\nBut they do. Each week a fresh guardian of taxpayers\u2019 money pontificates over West Ham\u2019s deal for the Olympic Stadium. From failed bidders to vested interests, all get a say. Brady stands accused of doing too well for her employers. And everyone ignores that bottom line. Without West Ham, what? A miserably small, rain-sodden concrete bowl, with scant relation in size or emotional charge to the site of London\u2019s Olympics. It would be as if the Games never happened.\n\nIt is a bright August afternoon: school holidays, yet the Olympic Park is dead. Nobody visits The Orbit monument. The European Hockey Championships are taking place at Eton Manor, to a shrug. Of the 16 sessions, just one is sold out. Deserted, forgotten, the Park needs its anchor tenant. No Olympic legacy is created without one.\n\nThe Aquatic Centre in Athens is weed-filled and dry. The iconic Birds Nest in Beijing has moonlighted as a Segway racetrack. Even Barcelona\u2019s Montjuic hosts events sporadically. In one of the greatest tourist destinations in Europe, it often stands empty.\n\nWith a small capacity and no roof in a wet country, London\u2019s Olympic Stadium would have quietly expired. So if Brady got the deal of the century, as is suggested \u2014 West Ham\u2019s end of the conversion is \u00a315million, the government pay \u00a3257m \u2014 where were the other entrepreneurs jostling to get in on the act? How come a mid-table Premier League football club had the only vision worth pursuing?\n\nWest Ham got the Olympic Stadium twice. Once to buy outright, later as anchor tenants. It was the London Legacy Development Corporation that decided not to go with the first option in which West Ham would have picked up the lion\u2019s share of costs.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium is currently being prepared to host games for the upcoming Rugby World Cup\n\nFrance, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa will all take the pitch during the Rugby World Cup\n\nTwo construction workers look out over the iconic stadium, one wearing a West Ham-branded high-vis jacket\n\nAn ice bath has already been installed in the dressing room ahead of West Ham's arrival\n\nBrady admits that some of the public are against what she calls the 'West Hamification' of the stadium\n\nClaret and blue tiles line the home side's shower room in tribute to the club's famous home kit\n\n\u2018That was the initial deal,\u2019 says Brady. \u2018The LLDC recognised they had made a mistake by not working out the legacy, saw all the other Olympic Stadiums that were left to rot and decided something permanent had to happen.\n\n\u2018Our choice was to buy and convert. We would have paid for the floodlights, the roof, the seats, the toilets, the turnstiles \u2014 everything would have been down to us. We could easily have funded \u00a3200m, particularly with the new television deal and we would have kept all the revenue, giving us a calendar year of income.\n\n\u2018We won the vote 11-0 and then they changed their minds. They wanted tenants instead. So they collapsed the old process and started a new one, which is where we are now. We came out unanimously as the best bid that time, too. So I don\u2019t think the criticism is fair.\n\n\u2018There were no sweetheart deals. It was me, on my own, against Allen & Overy, the government and all their advisers. They had more lawyers, more government consultants and officials than I have ever seen in my life and there was one seat on the other side, for me. But I knew they needed a football club and, ultimately, nothing would happen in the Park without us.\n\nWest Ham's presence could stop the stadium becoming running into disrepair like the Athens aquatics centre\n\nThe iconic Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing has a second role hosting segway competitions\n\n\u2018People think we got something for nothing in that room, but we didn\u2019t. I can\u2019t be the buyer and the seller. I can\u2019t negotiate against myself, my employers and the West Ham fans. My job is to exceed their expectations so when they walk in they say, \u201cYou know what, she was right. We had to move here\u201d. And then they don\u2019t care that we don\u2019t own it, or that it is ours for 23 days a year.\n\n\u2018And when people are spilling out into the park, or going to the athletics or the hockey because we\u2019re cross-promoting and they think of this as home and feel an attachment they didn\u2019t previously, and when there are concerts and the flats are full and this is part of the national fabric, that\u2019s the day I\u2019m looking forward to.\n\n\u2018Football is on the up right now so this gets called the deal of the century. But West Ham aren\u2019t getting rich because of the stadium. West Ham were getting rich anyway. The television money comes to us whether we\u2019re in the worst ground or the best, the brand value is building because of the success of the football club.\n\n\u2018Sometimes I feel like we took over a house that nobody wanted, did it up and made a fortune. Is that lucky? Is that the deal of the century or did you have a bit of foresight and make it work?\u2019\n\nOn the pitch, West Ham are eager to avoid relegation to the Championship ahead of their stadium move\n\nWest Ham have 17 home Premier League games remaining before they leave their home for the Olympic Park\n\nBack-to-back home defeats have raised the dark thought that West Ham could arrive as a Championship club, still needing to fill 54,000 seats against Huddersfield. It is the worst-case scenario, but just three games in Brady is not panicking yet. Her point remains that the Olympic Stadium would still have needed its tenant, regardless of short-term status.\n\n\u2018Simply, without West Ham, this place would have been demolished and the Park would be done,\u2019 she continues. \u2018If this is going to get the community usage, it needs a spark, a lot of events, and that\u2019s why a football tenant is the most important because it is our supporters who will fill it and bring the income that pays for it to be maintained.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re here for 99 years, not one season \u2013 and if you took our financial commitment over that time, you could build two Olympic Stadiums for the money.\n\n\u2018We are leaving a successful stadium that was ours for 365 days a year, giving up income streams, sharing catering revenue, sharing naming rights. Premier League football hits 4.4 billion people around the world. We bring that audience in. What would the naming rights be worth without West Ham?\n\n\u2018We have to build a whole new club infrastructure, offices, a club shop, install new software, new facilities \u2014 all of that is going to cost around \u00a37m on top of what we paid. And then people think we\u2019re in it just to sell up. But every angle was covered. Obviously, West Ham\u2019s worth will increase if we are successful here.\n\n\u2018The LLDC were worried our owners would have an incentive to sell. But we had the club valued in 2013 when the deal was done and the government receives a massive slice of any profit made on our shares after that. Of course, with the new TV deal, West Ham\u2019s value has risen anyway. But the government still gets its slice, even on stuff that has nothing to do with the new stadium.\u2019\n\nThat is the fear, of course. A couple of wide boys on the make, David Sullivan and David Gold \u2014 West Ham\u2019s co-owners, with their backgrounds in pornography and the Ann Summers chain \u2014 seizing this national treasure and as good as knocking it out from the back of a lorry.\n\nOnce West Ham have their 54,000-capacity ground, it is argued, they will sell their shares at a huge profit. Lovely jubbly.\n\nDavid Gold, one of West Ham's co-owners, has played a key role in the club securing access to the venue\n\nDavid Sullivan owns West Ham with Gold and will oversee the move from Upton Park to the Olympic Stadium\n\n\u2018Look at it another way,\u2019 Brady says. \u2018You\u2019ve got Goodwood, you\u2019ve got Ascot, all these institutions that are leaving British ownership, and we don\u2019t like it. So here are two businessmen, who pay all their tax in the UK and have given personal guarantees for every penny we owe. We can no longer borrow against our ground as an asset, so our owners have underwritten this move, personally.\u2019\n\nI say maybe there is distaste about Sullivan and Gold\u2019s past. That people would have been happier if reputable folk from the spotless environs of the City had done the deal instead.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think owning a chain of underwear shops like David Gold makes you a porn baron,\u2019 she counters. \u2018And I think Fifty Shades of Grey is a bit racier than some of the stuff David Sullivan was involved in during his twenties. It shouldn\u2019t taint you forever. David\u2019s early business life shouldn\u2019t define him.\n\nCAPACITY INCREASE? West Ham have been so buoyed by the sale of season tickets at the new Olympic Stadium that the club are already discussing increasing capacity to 66,000. The expansion would make West Ham\u2019s new ground the biggest of any club in London, eclipsing Arsenal\u2019s Emirates Stadium and Tottenham\u2019s new facility next to White Hart Lane. Despite erratic form at the start of their final season at Upton Park, West Ham\u2019s owners are greatly encouraged by the take-up of tickets at the Olympic venue. They will move in at the start of next season, 2016-17. And with the current capacity at 54,000, there is the potential to fill in space around the top of the arena with another 12,000 seats. Karren Brady, West Ham vice-chair, said this is something the club are already considering. \u2018We always knew this was a possibility and it would certainly seem the interest is there,\u2019 she said. \u2018We have to look at the logistics of it because these would be the seats furthest from the pitch, so we have to make sure they are worth having. There is no point sticking someone in a corner with a poor view. But if the sight lines are still good, we could fit in 66,000. It\u2019s a very exciting prospect.\u2019\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t like losing Ascot but when two British taxpayers come along and show a bit of vision and ambition, we don\u2019t like that, either.\u2019\n\nAnd there is vision in the way the Olympic Stadium has been remodelled. The way the floodlights have been inverted in the new roof structure, the largest cantilevered structure of its kind in Europe.\n\nThe Great Britain lounge will permanently celebrate Olympic and other sporting successes, with the World Cup winners\u2019 medals of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters \u2014 all owned by West Ham \u2014 finally removed from vaults and placed on display.\n\nPeople forget the elitist nature of the old stadium. There were 400 VIP seats, exclusively used by IOC members. Event tickets cost a fortune. A personal recollection? On August 10, 2012, my wife took one of our sons to the athletics. We paid \u00a3900 for the privilege of watching the biggest cheat of the Games, Asli Cakir Alptekin, win the women\u2019s 1,500 metres. She has now returned her gold medal and is serving an eight-year ban, for a second doping offence.\n\nSo let\u2019s not pretend that handing the stadium over to the tainted sport of athletics would be any less controversial in today\u2019s climate. As for tickets, the main complaint appears to be that West Ham will make them too cheap.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve heard we will be dumping free tickets everywhere to fill this place,\u2019 Brady adds. \u2018We won\u2019t. If we do that, nobody will value a seat at West Ham. The Charlton Athletic Supporters Club are complaining, but Charlton can\u2019t sell out. They have empty seats. So it\u2019s not as if we are taking Charlton supporters. It\u2019s that there are not enough of them in the first place. And that\u2019s not our fault.\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s quite insulting to Charlton fans to paint them as so fickle that they\u2019ll buy a season ticket for a rival club, just because we\u2019ve got a new ground. No Charlton fan is going to wake up on the first morning of next season and think, \u201cOh, I\u2019m West Ham now\u201d.\u2019\n\nIt is CAST who have complained to the Information Commissioner about the redacted passages in West Ham\u2019s contract, particularly specific figures detailing the split between the club and the LLDC.\n\n\u2018They think it was all underhand, but there is a reason for the blanks,\u2019 Brady insists. \u2018This is a multi- purpose stadium. Other people will want to use it. If all they have to do is open West Ham\u2019s contract and see the figures, that\u2019s the end of the negotiation, isn\u2019t it? The LLDC have no position.\u2019\n\nBrady, pictured with Gold and Sullivan in 2011, says the move will allow a regeneration of the area to take place\n\nWe watch a tractor with a handy piece of equipment erect rugby posts at each end. France are due here for their Pool D game with Romania on September 23. New Zealand, Ireland, Italy and South Africa will also visit \u2014 and the World Cup\u2019s third place play-off will be the stadium\u2019s final act before conversion begins in readiness for West Ham\u2019s arrival in 2016. That is when it will look like West Ham\u2019s home: claret and blue seats and the name above the door.\n\n\u2018Some people don\u2019t like what we call the \u201cWest Hamification\u201d of the stadium,\u2019 Brady says, \u2018but it has got to look like our home or our fans are not going to get behind it. And they have got to do that for it to work.\n\n\u2018I feel a huge sense of personal responsibility that I am part of the delivery programme here. We\u2019ve made a promise to fill this place and bring the Park to life and we will do exactly that. And of all the clubs that could represent Britain, I think West Ham is that club.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re fleecing British taxpayers because we\u2019re taxpayers, too. We will ensure this stadium is full, that jobs are created and regeneration takes place. And I can say that because I\u2019m the one doing it.\u2019", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

for heroes, but it doesn't sit there doing nothing for 50 weeks", "text": "A tour around the Olympic Stadium with Karren Brady sparked this week's debate. Read it here. Have West Ham mugged the taxpayer or have West Ham helped save a national treasure? I know what I think. You decide.\n\nAnd like my dreams they fade and die\u2026 King Sandro, London.\n\nNo idea the point of that post, mate. But here's the original.\n\nThe British tax payers, Lotto players and football fans are being ripped off by this decision to allow West Ham supporters a cheap way to watch their club. Charge West Ham a decent amount to have this ground on lease and set a weekly cut of gate share, which they would never have got otherwise. Alf2, Sunderland.\n\nWest Ham will pay \u00a32.5million annually to use the stadium for 23 days, and give up the lion's share of catering and naming rights. If they had to share gate revenue, too, and pay more than roughly \u00a3108,500 per match, the terms would have become uncompetitive and the deal would have been lost. Then the taxpayer really would be getting nothing for something. As for Lotto players, it's a choice. Don't buy one if you don't like it.\n\nI've always wanted a ticket to the Olympic Stadium. Looks like West Ham will have at least 20,000 spare every game. Devil Dance, United Kingdom.\n\nAnd amid the stupidity, a serious point is by accident made. Here a bit of the conversation with Karren Brady that didn't make it into the column, to clarify. 'A lot of people didn't get the chance to see the stadium during the Olympics. Next season, as away fans, they can. I'm sure they will, too. That has a knock-on effect in the area, from the shops to the hotels, and particularly the Park. This is the catalyst for everything that goes on here \u2013 over the season there will be one million people engaging in the area. We will cross-promote events \u2013 hockey, swimming, athletics, our supporters will get offered deals to go to those events, those sports that need a wider audience.' I know you were trying to knock it, but see what I did there?\n\nAs for the Charlton fans who keep piping up: isn't this the club that laid on coaches to take fans from Gillingham to The Valley for games? Jitman, London.\n\nIndeed it is, Jitman. And still does, in fact. Their website confirms this. 'The club continues to run the popular Valley Express service, bringing in supporters old and new to home matches from dozens of pick-up points across Kent and Sussex.' So by new customers, one presumes they mean people who previously didn't support Charlton Athletic. And as these pick-up points include the home of Football League teams Brighton, Gillingham and Crawley Town, and National League teams Margate, Dover, Maidstone and Eastbourne, it does seem rather hypocritical to accuse West Ham of trying to poach Charlton fans simply by existing in a bigger stadium. It's not as if extra ferries are being laid on from Woolwich. Anyway, Charlton have never been considered rivals to West Ham. London is the only city in England whose clubs divide on the points of a compass \u2013 north, south, east and west. Charlton are a south London club, West Ham from east London. Folk in provincial cities might find this surprising, but there is about as much chance of a south Londoner veering towards West Ham as there is of a bloke in Sheffield deciding to support Leeds.\n\nLet us have an interview with Barry Hearn now. Tom Graham, Coventry.\n\nYes, he can talk us through the times he discussed moving Leyton Orient to Basildon and Harlow. And explain why, if Orient wanted the stadium so much, they were not part of the final bidding process for tenancy; or the initial bidding process to buy outright for that matter.\n\nKarren Brady speaks to Martin Samuel at the Olympic Stadium about West Ham's move there next season\n\nBrady spoke candidly about West Ham's move to the stadium and her answers prompted this debate\n\nThe fact is the London taxpayer was forced to pay for this stadium or face prison. The London taxpayer wouldn't have had to pay \u00a3280m for conversion if Tottenham had got the stadium, as the club would have paid it. That's what needs an explanation. If they weren't going to go with Tottenham then whoever rented it should have paid much more money to do so. PJ, London.\n\nActually the taxpayer (not the London taxpayer, because the stadium is nationally funded) has to pay taxes or face prison (not a specific tax for the Olympic Stadium) anyway. What did you think, mate? If Tottenham bought it someone was going to knock on your day and give you a 10 quid rebate? 'There you go, son, that tenner was for converting the Olympic Stadium into a multi-purpose national venue. We don't need it now. Don't spent it all at once.' Is that what happened when they sold the Millennium Dome? Because I must have been out when the government popped round with my fiver from that fiasco. As for your second point, a Mr Koopa will explain.\n\nWest Ham would have paid it too, if you had bothered to read the actual article. The problem was the LLDC decided not to sell the stadium and instead lease it out, so Tottenham withdrew. If there was more, indeed any, competition I'm sure the rent would have been higher. But there wasn't, so it was a case of either letting West Ham have it, at a rent that will amount to \u00a3198m eventually, plus a share of naming and catering revenue that will more than cover the conversion costs, or let it sit empty and have the taxpayers fund a rotting, empty bowl. Worked out great for the Millennium Dome, didn't it? Koopa, London.\n\nGlad you mentioned the Dome, Koopa. We paid \u00a3789m for that, including huge maintenance costs when it stood idle, before the lease went to Meridian Delta and then AEG. They spent \u00a3600m developing it into the largest entertainment complex in Europe and sold the naming rights to O2 for \u00a36m a year. Have you been lately? The venues, the restaurants, the catering, the shops, the residences, the events, the tickets \u2013 how long do you think before they get their money back? And nobody in our government had the brains to manage that aspect of the development. We have the freehold, with a 993-year lease now owned by Trinity College, Cambridge, as part of its property portfolio, so our part of it is in essence a gigantic loss, minus 15 per cent of AEG's net profit on the site every year. In year one, even with extra opening costs, the O2 made a pre-tax profit of \u00a315.6m. So the government got back a sliver of \u00a3789m. By 2012, the site was returning \u00a362.8m. And we sold that, don't forget. Meanwhile, when AEG went on the market that year and with the O2 complex included, the company was valued in the region of \u00a34.5 billion. So if we had spent the \u00a3600m on further developing the site, and had managed it as well as AEG, we'd have all of the money back, from that and the original project, in between 20 and 25 years. Instead? We may break even around 2094. So the idea that selling saves the taxpayer money, long-term, is fallacy. Selling chokes the income stream and that is the only way the money can ever be recouped. It just takes time.\n\nI think Leyton Orient would have liked to get it but they were quickly ruled out. Brum, West Midlands.\n\nWith proper foresight Leyton Orient should have been awarded the hockey stadium, with drop-in pitches, grass and synthetic, to accommodate the two sports. I wrote this at the time, but vision is not our strong point, I'm afraid.\n\nRemember a few years ago when West Ham played Reading in what was pretty much a promotion decider and they were still advertising tickets the night before the game because they couldn't sell out? David, Reading.\n\nMarch 31, 2012. Yes, I remember the match, David. West Ham lost 4-2. But the gate was 33,350, so bigger than all Premier League attendances that day, bar two. Manchester City got 47,007 for the visit of Sunderland \u2013 mind you they were two points off the top \u2013 and Aston Villa attracted 34,740 for Chelsea, so 1,390 more than West Ham got for Reading. Interesting, though, that 47,000 at City \u2013 because nobody thought they would fill their new ground, either. But I feel clubs should think big. Maybe if there was more aspiration at Reading, you wouldn't be getting 16,547 for Milton Keynes Dons.\n\nAbdoulaye Faye shrugs as Reading celebrate a win which moved them four points clear of West Ham in 2012\n\nSam Allardyce - more about him later - looks anguished during the loss, but his team went up via the play-offs\n\nWhy couldn't Orient share? It would make perfect sense. Southlondonsnumber1, London.\n\nWhat, a club that got 4,949 for Stevenage Borough last week, in a ground with a 54,000 capacity? Yes, if you wanted them dead, it would.\n\nThank God for Brady and the Bongo Brothers saving the taxpayer a fortune. What's that? We are paying for everything? Oh. Rob, Hampshire.\n\nIt's not their job to save the taxpayer a fortune, Rob. That's what a government is for, if you are that way inclined politically.\n\nWest Ham were about to buy it till Tottenham and Orient kicked up a stink. We won the first bid then they called for a review on the process and the government changed it to a tenancy. Tottenham never intended getting it. Daniel Levy just used it as a bargaining tool to get favourable terms for their new stadium because the council became worried they would move out of Tottenham. Isn't a lot of the improved infrastructure included in their new stadium now subsidised as a result? Tottenham fans are just jealous because West Ham are close to moving on before them. How many government funded schemes have my approval or have I had any use from anyway? Boom Town, London.\n\nIndeed. And here's The Observer's take \u2013 dated March 22, 2015 \u2013 on the aftermath of Tottenham's failed Olympic stadium bid, and what Levy then managed to extract from London mayor Boris Johnson, and others, by way of compensation. 'Tottenham lost the bid, with Levy by all accounts furious with Johnson for leading him up a garden path, but only after the club's legal challenges had helped make less generous the deal offered by the public purse to the pornography magnates who run West Ham. Spurs made a further challenge, eventually called off, after which Johnson announced some funding to assist Tottenham, and the area around the stadium in particular. Tottenham also went back to Haringey to ask for a better deal on their planning permission: they wanted the requirement to build affordable housing, usual with proposed residential developments, to be removed. They wanted their Section 106 contribution, the money paid to help the public costs associated with private development, and which here included such things as upgrading nearby railway stations, reduced from \u00a316.4m to \u00a3500,000. By now the riots had happened and Haringey, probably anxious to see something make progress in Tottenham, agreed to the reductions.' The figure from Johnson's office for infrastructure was \u00a38.5m. So, yes, Tottenham clobbered the taxpayer for close to \u00a325m, preying on the fear that followed the 2011 riots, while offering nothing in return.\n\nFantastic, unbelievable, stupendous deal for West Ham. It's so good it can be called legal robbery. Financially, the best deal on the table was from Tottenham and there is no denying that. I know Lord Coe wanted an athletics track retained \u2013 but let's be honest, who the hell watches athletics? Joe Mayo, London.\n\nIt's all in the timing, isn't it, Joe? As the heroes of the London Olympics' Super Saturday \u2013 Greg Rutherford, Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill \u2013 have all just won gold again in Beijing, can you imagine the hollow feeling if the stadium they graced in their own country was in ruins and all we had to show was a tarted-up Crystal Palace? Plenty of people watch athletics but not often enough for us to have a designated 54,000-capacity arena. That is why this is the best solution. We can still host major events, we still have a home fit for heroes \u2013 but it doesn't sit there doing nothing the other 50 weeks of the year. If we had knocked the Olympic Stadium down for a football club, right now \u2013 in this of all weeks \u2013 we would have looked like the most short-sighted nation in the world.\n\nMo Farah shows off his trademark finish to beat training partner Galen Rupp to victory in the 10,000m in 2012\n\nLike Farah, Greg Rutherford continued his heroics after Super Saturday with victory in the Bird's Nest\n\nI can never understand the Tottenham argument. They are not from East London. Their roots and heritage are in North London. How or why they wanted the stadium is beyond me. Andy H, Essex.\n\nAnd I also remember the protests from their fans when it was proposed they moved to Stratford. Now half of them act like they've had something stolen from them. Equally, if Tottenham are so keen on helping the taxpayer, their owner, Joe Lewis, could start by paying his over here.\n\nSo Karren Brady showed Hagrid around the new stadium, did she? 'We'll have the best stadium in the whole of the championship.' Baz, Sunderland.\n\nAnd Sunderland will have the second. Now bog off before I set the dragons on you.\n\nDavid Sullivan and David Gold spent years at Birmingham City trying to get the council to fund a new stadium for them. Once it was never going to happen, they moved to West Ham and, guess what, they got a new stadium paid for by someone else. What an amazing coincidence. WeKnowTheScore, Birmingham.\n\nStill, at least Birmingham have thrived since they left, eh?\n\nWest Ham versus Newcastle on Monday, September 14, kids get in for \u00a31 because we struggle to sell out Upton Park. Where are these new fans waiting to fill this soulless bowl? The vast majority of fans don't want to leave the Boleyn. HHCD, Rochford.\n\nThat's just not true. The majority of West Ham fans that I know are behind, and very excited by, this move. And I don't think there will be much of a problem selling out in the first season. When the novelty wears off, if the team isn't doing well \u2013 that's when the hard work starts.\n\nThe government put themselves in a no-win situation as a lack of alternatives killed their negotiating position. What were they supposed to do with it after the 2012 Olympics anyway? We all loved the Olympics and it's a bit disingenuous to now cry foul. Steviejay99, Colchester.\n\nI agree, Steve. Everyone now talks about the Olympics as if it was meant to be a property deal. It was the Olympics, we loved it, we had to build a stadium for it, but now it's over. So the only way forward is to continue finding ways to use it. This requires some extra conversion costs \u2013 because the project was poorly conceived initially \u2013 but the idea that the only reason for building was to stage some long-term property coup on behalf of the taxpayer is fatuous.\n\nIt will be a fantastic facility with absolutely no atmosphere. Fans miles from the pitch, and they'll never fill it. GR, Manchester.\n\nNot necessarily. During my visit I deliberately walked up to the very top of the stadium and stood where the farthest fan will be. There were workmen on the other side of the pitch, so I had a fair idea of what players will look like from that distance, too. It wasn't bad. Certainly, I would imagine you are more divorced from proceedings in the equivalent seat at Old Trafford, which may be nearer the pitch but is considerably higher. As for the atmosphere, anyone who thinks it is impossible to create one in a football ground with a running track has never been to watch Napoli at home. Liveliest ground in Europe \u2013 and there's a running track. Bayern Munich didn't do too badly at their old place, either.\n\nNapoli's San Paolo Stadium fills up ahead of a Coppa Italia match with Atalanta earlier this year\n\nWhen full, the stadium is capable of breathtaking noise with fans creating an unparalleled atmosphere\n\nWhoever took over the stadium would have wanted the same rates as West Ham. So they just got there first really. Where Am I 2, London.\n\nCertainly, any tenant would expect the place to be habitable before moving in; and wouldn't expect to pay the full cost of that conversion or anything like it.\n\nYou cannot blame West Ham. If it's such a bad deal for the taxpayer then the blame lies at the government and dopey Boris Johnson's door. They have shirked their responsibility, which if you look at the Conservative party's history is typical, giving money away to their mates. You get what you vote for with the Conservative party. Longshanks, London.\n\nExcept the idiot politicians who failed to set the stadium up with a viable legacy \u2013 Ken Livingstone and Tessa Jowell \u2013 were both Labour. And the Conservative head of the London Assembly is a vocal opponent of the deal. I don't think this is a party political issue but if Karren Brady used her influence within the Conservative Party \u2013 and I don't feel she did \u2013 then that would be one of the advantages of having English owners. A bit hard for much of the Premier League to carry that sway when the clubs are owned in Russia, the Middle East and the United States.\n\nWhy didn't the Daily Mail send the journalist who wrote the original article containing all the questions that needed asking about this deal to do the interview, instead of Martin Samuel who has continually praised it in his column? Kevin, Rhyl.\n\nReading David Jones' recent article condemning the deal, it would seem he did speak to West Ham and the London Legacy Development Corporation. The LLDC are quoted, and there is a paragraph that begins 'West Ham, for its part, claimed\u2026' which would suggest contact. So David chose what material he included in his piece \u2013 the Charlton Athletic Supporters Club, Barry Hearn, Andrew Boff, Conservative leader of the London Assembly \u2013 just as I choose what goes in my column. I'm sure Baroness Brady would have talked to him about the project, if asked. And the Mail did not send anybody to speak to Karren. Offered the chance to see the site for the first time, I took it. It was my interview, not a commission from the newspaper. As you say, I have been in favour of a football tenant since the Stadium was first built. So, by the way, has Sir Steven Redgrave. When London was awarded the Olympics, he said the Stadium should house Arsenal or Tottenham Hotspur, perhaps both, when the tournament was over. A pity the people in charge of the project \u2013 Livingstone, Jowell and Lord Coe \u2013 did not have his vision. As far back as February 2004, in The Times, I was advocating a football legacy and no mention of West Ham in that column. So this isn't a case of wanting a deal for West Ham. I wanted football to take on the Stadium because football is the only sport that could fill it. 'Athletics is opera to football's good musical. If the sport had to fund its own way, it would sink into a hole in the ground.' I stand by every word of that sentence and it was from a Times column over 11 years ago. To put that into perspective, this was in the charts. Nice bit of Dada for the video, too.\n\nThe biggest mistake was not incorporating legacy right from the start as they did for Manchester City and the Commonwealth Games stadium. Saltyseadog, South England.\n\nQuite right. It would have been easy to design a multi-purpose stadium along the lines of the Stade de France but the politicians, and Lord Coe, wouldn't have it. Jowell will now run for London Mayor as if she helped organised a resounding triumph.\n\nI'm a Hammer since the sixties and I hate this plastic monstrosity. The Boleyn Ground is magnetic and has character. They just want more corporate seats. This is all the about money and the prawn sandwich brigade. Wampum, Afghanistan.\n\nPlastic monstrosity? What about the fake castles on the front facade at Upton Park? It looks like a lousy ride at Disneyland. And, yes, no doubt the owners want more corporate seats. Maybe you are one of the fans currently moaning that the club needs players. How many do you think can be bought with Kids For A Quid? And now, realists.\n\nI've probably seen 1,000 games over Upton Park but I'm getting older, have moved away and don't go so much now. The young fans want this to happen and I'm delighted for them. To be honest, much of the old atmosphere went with introduction of all-seater stadiums same as everywhere else. The world has changed and West Ham need to move with the times. I can't wait to go and see the new place. Suns Out Guns Out, Ireland.\n\nI have been going since the 1970s. The Chicken Run has gone, the North and South Banks have gone, the Boleyn lost all its charm for me when it became all-seater. The West Stand now makes it look lopsided, because we're not allowed to build the East Stand bigger. It was all local support when I started going, proper fans, but no one lives around the ground anyone, so it's unrecognisable. Walking up Green Street, sometimes you don't actually know you're in West Ham territory until you see the dodgy turrets. I'm in, because it can't be worse and a lot of clubs have made it work. I've been to the Emirates. They call it soulless but, to be honest, I can't remember Highbury being noisier. If the younger ones want this for West Ham, they will go and support it. I don't buy into the argument that you can't take your history. You can: history is the past, your memories, and you can take them anywhere. ICWHS, Stockholm.\n\nI agree. I go to plenty of new grounds, but that doesn't mean I forget the old places: the Invincibles season at Highbury, watching Matt Le Tissier at The Dell. When I left London to work for The People in Manchester at the age of 20, the first game I attended was an FA Cup semi-final replay between Manchester United and Liverpool at Maine Road. United 1-0 down, then 2-1 up. It was electrifying. You don't forget that. If Everton ever get away from Goodison Park, it won't erase the memory of the night they beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup-Winners' Cup semi-final. Andy Gray battering their centre-halves, and the Munich bench banging their fists in frustration on the top of the dug-out, because they wanted their big hairy-a***d defenders to get more protection from the referee. Marvellous stuff.\n\nThe exterior of the Boleyn Ground features two fake castles, which resemble something from a theme park\n\nBryan Robson levels at Maine Road to put United on their way to a thrilling victory against Liverpool in 1985\n\nBayern Munich were bullied by Andy Gray (centre) during Everton's Cup-Winners' Cup triumph that year\n\nThe Olympics are a history of billions spent on venues that rarely get used beyond the Games. Frank, Montreal.\n\nI can see why you may think that, Frank, although Montreal's problem was not so much the usage \u2013 Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League played at the Olympic Stadium in the immediate aftermath of the 1976 Games and were well-supported and very successful \u2013 as the fact that the stadium was poorly constructed. Bits kept falling off. It wasn't finished when the Games started and the tower and roof were not completed until 11 years later. Even now, if more than 1.2 inches of snow is due to fall in the next 24 hours, the stadium cannot be used because the roof is unsafe. Montreal Impact cancelled an MLS game there for that reason as recently as March 2014. And while it was a poor venue for baseball, Montreal Expos gates were not bad at the start. I agree that, now, is it underused. No anchor tenant since 2004. But Montreal's problems were that costs doubled due to an over-ambitious design, and the structural quality of the stadium was poor. It did get the use, initially.\n\nWest Ham will only get 54,000 if the away end holds 20,000. West Ham are a very small club in comparison to Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal in London. Peterhouse1997, Cambridge University.\n\nI don't object to my taxes paying for public works, but I do object to them paying for your education, if this is an example of the Cambridge brains trust. Barnet are a very small club by comparison to the three you mention. Leyton Orient, too. West Ham are smaller, that's all. Certainly than Arsenal and, to a lesser extent, Tottenham. As for Chelsea, their super club status is recent. Before, there wasn't very much in it. Indeed, had Roman Abramovich come to east London, West Ham would be a bigger club than Chelsea right now; the same applies had he bought Tottenham. Chelsea are expanding quickly now, obviously, but I've seen them relegated at Stamford Bridge and West Ham often drew more, even in the early days of the Premier League. For instance, 1994 \u2013 when Chelsea's average attendance was 19,416 and West Ham's was 20,572; or 1992, when Chelsea got 18,686 and West Ham 21,342. Go back to 1987 when Chelsea drew 17,694 in the old Division One and West Ham 20,608. And in the years when Chelsea were out of the top division, and West Ham were not, crowds at Upton Park were often double. In 1983, Chelsea averaged 12,672 and West Ham 22,822 \u2013 a year earlier Chelsea's average was 13,132 and West Ham's 26,585. I doubt very much if you are on for a first mate. Do they give fourths at your place?\n\nKarren Brady is very good at self-publicity. But which other football club could have moved into this stadium, taking into account geographical and financial factors? West Ham are the only one with a fan base situated near to the stadium, with enough supporters and cash. She cannot say they were cleverer than the other clubs as none of them could have capitalised on this opportunity like West Ham. JRGordon1000, London.\n\nNo, but they could have stayed where they were, couldn't they? And thought small.\n\nGet in there, sell the club to the first dubious billionaire that rocks up and the porn barons are quids in. And the West Ham that we've all admired over the years will be dead. Progress? Roger Kint, Liverpool.\n\nThe West Ham that you've all patronised over the years, you mean. The West Ham that were never a threat. And did you read the part about what happens if the owners sell, and who gets the money?\n\nWhere's the legacy if Tottenham got it? WHU647580, Toronto.\n\nThe athletics legacy would have been a purpose built stadium and indoor training facilities at Crystal Palace \u2013 the home of athletics. Stratford is to athletics what the Etihad Stadium is to the England football team. Real Ale Madrid, United Kingdom.\n\nYes, because when we think of Jessica Ennis-Hill, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford, we all think of Crystal Palace, don't we? The times we trekked across town to a corner of London with no tube link to watch them run there. No, fool, we think of the London Olympic Stadium. That is what changed in 2012. Athletics became synonymous with that venue, which is why we hold the Anniversary Games there each year. And athletics can continue to have its spiritual home in the arena where we won three Olympic gold medals in one night, because the West Ham tenancy kept that legacy alive.\n\nI heard recently that if we had told Olympic officials that the stadium was to be handed to a football club after the event, we would not have won the 2012 Olympic Games. Not only did they hand it to a football club, they handed it to a second rate one, run by two of the most loathsome men in the game, Gold and Sullivan. Very disappointing. Noelw1969, Stafford.\n\nYes, the IOC are certainly very good at spending everybody else's money. How to explain it to them? How about this? Look, boys and girls, we paid for your three-week jamboree, we put you all up at five-star hotels, gave you chauffeurs, your own car lanes and your VIP seats and smiled politely even though we knew we were dealing with some of the biggest crooks on the planet, and you'll admit we put on one hell of a show. But now it's over and we need to do what we need to do with the stadium we built; so why don't you toddle off and bankrupt your next country? Thank you.\n\nI think this whole Olympic Stadium business is disgusting. Arsenal have had to pay \u00a3600m to build their stadium, Tottenham and Chelsea the same. Why is it West Ham can be given this stadium? Halftime Hooch, Luton.\n\nOh dear, Disgusted of Luton writes. Anyway, the clue is in that phrase you used to describe the Emirates. Their stadium. It's Arsenal's ground \u2013 and they got plenty of state or local council help with Compulsory Purchase Orders, don't forget \u2013 so they keep all the revenue. Tottenham and Chelsea, too. West Ham do not own the Olympic Stadium \u2013 it will be used by the LLDC to host athletics, motor sport, World Cup rugby, cricket, pop concerts, and none of those other activities are making a contribution because, like West Ham, they are only tenants. Now West Ham have special privileges as the anchor tenant, but they give up the rights that Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea will use to help fund their moves and restructuring. Such as the money received from calling it the Emirates Stadium. It really shouldn't be that hard to understand.\n\nJessica Ennis competes in the long jump on her way to a famous victory at the Olympic Stadium\n\nFollowing the unforgettable scenes of that year, the likes of Usain Bolt compete at the Anniversary Games\n\nThis stadium was part of the \u00a39billion it cost for the 2012 Olympic Games, of which the north east got a big fat zero, but still had to pay. Waxi, Newcastle.\n\nYes, and I've never walked over the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, which cost \u00a322m. Sometimes there are national projects that benefit one area. Manchester had bid for the Olympics several times, unsuccessfully. It was explained to our Olympic Committee that the Games were never going to the provinces, but if London applied we had a chance. Sorry, but that's the way it was. To digress slightly, during the first Kevin Keegan era I was in Newcastle quite a lot. A few of us would stay at the Copthorne Hotel on the quay. Every time we booked a taxi to the ground, the concierge gave the same advice. 'Big game tonight,' he'd say. 'I wouldn't leave it any later than six.' So we left at six. And at 6.03pm, we'd pull up outside St James' Park. And do you know what that told me? That you lot haven't a clue what real traffic is like. My point being that there are some benefits of living in Newcastle, such as cheaper housing and traffic jams that wouldn't cause mild cursing in Barkingside High Street, and while Londoners may pay the national debt of Belgium to live in a house the size of a crate, and sit drumming their fingers in traffic for two hours for no apparent reason, we get to host the Olympics because we're the capital city. But you can all come, if you wish, and you can all watch it on television, if you don't. Yes, in an ideal world, it would have been a nationally hosted event with benefits for all. But the IOC don't want to leave Park Lane and that's not London's fault. But at least some people see the bigger picture.\n\nIt makes complete sense for a successful club to take over the stadium so that it can still be used for other purposes, too. Otherwise it would end up going to waste like so many other Olympic venues. It's the benefit of being based in London. Liverpool or Everton would love the opportunity to take on something like this. Jenna McKenna-May, Liverpool.\n\nExactly, Jenna. It's a geographical advantage \u2013 although I did think there was one opportunity on Merseyside, now gone. You probably won't agree, but I have always thought it really unfortunate that the ground-sharing issue between Liverpool and Everton could never be resolved. Don't get me wrong, I understand club identities and respect that fans want to keep their independence above all, but one fabulous venue, an Allianz Arena, on Stanley Park, glowing red when Liverpool play, blue for Everton, as happens in Munich\u2026 Ah well. Still, while we're on the subject\u2026\n\nAC Milan and Inter Milan hate each other with a passion that is far beyond any English rivalry, yet they've shared a ground for 68 years. Likewise Roma and Lazio for over 50 years. Juventus and Torino also shared for most of their histories. So why can't English clubs save themselves a fortune and do the same? DrAds, Jersey.\n\nYes, but Juventus have now broken away and Roma will do soon, and one of the reasons is they do not like being tenants and wish to keep all of the revenue from their stadium. I suppose every club wants its own distinct character. People from outside Merseyside are more inclined to advocate sharing for Liverpool and Everton because, in recent years, both clubs have been looking for ways to expand and Stanley Park is in such proximity to Anfield and Goodison Park, but I can understand why the fans wouldn't welcome it. Chelsea are out of Stamford Bridge for three years and if they wanted to use the Olympic Stadium, I think West Ham's owners could be persuaded. But I don't think the supporters of either club would be happy. I feel your argument is built on a false premise that Italian rivalries are felt more strongly than English ones.\n\nA soulless concrete bowl with pretty lights will never be for me. But it's all about money now. Forget history and tradition. Despite many bad memories at Upton Park, the good ones are tremendous. There is no better place under the floodlights and it will be a sad day when we leave. Denzel78, London.\n\nYes and it would have been a sadder one had the owners sat idle while every other major club in London \u2013 Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea \u2013 expanded until one day West Ham fans woke up and the club was the size of Queens Park Rangers. Actually, scratch that, even QPR are talking about moving to a bigger ground than Loftus Road.\n\nUpton Park on match day has an incredible atmosphere. This won't compete. Outinthesticks, Chelmsford.\n\nYes. That's why they have won so many trophies there.\n\nAC Milan and Inter Milan have shared the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza - the San Siro - for almost seven decades\n\nFrank McAvennie's diving header helped West Ham beat Watford at a lively Upton Park in November 1985\n\nLet's have transparency and the full facts revealed by the Freedom of Information request. Let us all be assured that the deal is not only legal but ethically fair and acceptable in the current climate. David Todman, Portsmouth.\n\nAs was explained, many of the redacted figures in the deal are to allow the LLDC to negotiate aggressively with other users. If every last penny of West Ham's arrangement was made public the LLDC would have no bargaining position. Bidding for Premier League football is blind because that forces the price up. If it wasn't, the second bidder could just offer 1p more than the first.\n\nSo many bitter Tottenham fans on here. Maybe it's the view from Milton Keynes they don't like. Can you see the Olympic Stadium from there? Tommy, London.\n\nUsually, this debate has no truck with tribal postings. But as it finds it rather amusing that master negotiator Daniel Levy must pack up for Milton Keynes because, somehow, he has failed to secure a temporary home in London for an event he knew was coming, I'll let that one slide.\n\nBaroness Brady is clearly an excellent businesswoman and negotiator but loves to get herself on camera. Say what you like about Abramovich, the Glazers and whoever actually owns Arsenal, at least they keep themselves out of the limelight. Stevethevillafan, Birmingham.\n\nYes, and everyone complains that you never hear from them and they are completely remote and unapproachable. The owner of Arsenal \u2013 the man you couldn't name \u2013 is known as 'Silent' Stan Kroenke. They don't mean it as a compliment. One could argue that on occasions the owners of West Ham overshare, but if that is their worst trait, it's not a bad one. Take David Sullivan's comments about Charlie Austin last week. Was it wise? No. Could it come back to haunt him? Most certainly. If West Ham ever come up against Austin in the future, he certainly won't need much motivating. But every West Ham fan was asking why they weren't bidding for Austin, and now they know. Would Arsenal's fans like to hear from Kroenke right now on the absence of major signings this summer? I'd say yes.\n\nTo me, it is great to have another potential rival to upset the established elite. Mike, Perth.\n\nI feel the same way, Mike. I want every club to grow and invest because that improves the competition. I hate caps on ambition, such as Financial Fair Play.\n\nThank goodness the taxpayers of Boston and the state of Massachusetts didn't fall for the Olympic fantasy, which more often than not results in expensive, empty venues. The people get stuck with the bills while consultants and construction companies reap the rewards. PM61, Boston.\n\nI think these are worrying times for the Olympic movement, when you consider the bidding process for the Winter Games in 2022. Only dubious regimes, China and Azerbaijan, were interested. The Games are becoming too costly for western democracies. The World Cup is going the same way.\n\nIt is a wonderful stadium, but not for football. Most fans will need binoculars to see who's on the ball. Ankyp4nky, Northampton.\n\nThe way West Ham are playing right now, mate, my guess would be the opposition.\n\nIt is a concrete bowl, the least impressive Olympic stadium in living memory, and was built as the budget games. The legacy of the Olympics is the medals won and the children inspired, not plastic seats and concrete pillars. It should have gone to the bid which cost least, Tottenham buying the land outright, as every taxpayer is now subsidising West Ham and what supporter of another club would want that? Steven, Liverpool.\n\nYou are right about the budget aspect. One of the reasons the conversion costs are enormous is that so much of the original structure was temporary. West Ham wouldn't have entertained it in that state and nor, I'm sure, would the organisers of the Rugby World Cup.\n\nIf West Ham saw the stadium's potential they should have paid what it was worth to them. Instead they exploited the fact no-one else wanted it so they could get it on the cheap. Carroll, Manchester.\n\nNo, don't all rush at once, I've got this one. So what you are saying is that if you saw a house that was derelict and nobody wanted to buy it on the market for \u00a3200,000, but you knew that it had exceptional features and potential that could be realised with investment and would sell for, say, \u00a31m, you wouldn't pay the asking price \u2013 or even try to knock it down as you were the sole bidder? 'No,' you'd say, 'if I spent \u00a3400,000 on this house it could be worth \u00a31m. So here's a cheque for \u00a3600,000 and we'll hear no more of it.' I take it you're not in business.\n\nSo West Ham are basically squatters? Sounds about right. Neil Carson, Belfast.\n\nNot all squatters are bad mate. This lot were squatters.\n\nI'd love to see the Deeds of Sale for Ascot and Goodwood. My rudimentary checks suggest both remain in British ownership, albeit with huge Middle Eastern sponsorship of certain meetings. No doubt The Queen and Lord Richmond will confirm the divestments if indeed the sales went through. Rtj1211, London.\n\nFair point and apologies. Blame me, because I may have misunderstood the point Karren was making. I am told, however, that if you had gone to Goodwood this year, you would have thought the place was owned by the Qataris. And that the members were not happy with the changes.\n\nHowever much Conservative peer Brady tries to portray the negotiations as a David and Goliath confrontation, it clearly never was. West Ham have benefited greatly from her government connections and good luck to them. The reality is football fills stadiums, athletics doesn't and that should have been central to the planning and construction of the stadium. Manchester City Council have a great deal, and a fantastically beneficial working relationship with Manchester City, all of which was in place before any work commenced on the City of Manchester Stadium. If London and the people involved in the Olympics had put personal interests to one side and looked at how Manchester dealt with the long term legacy of the Commonwealth Games they would have secured a far better deal for the taxpayers. Boz59, Manchester.\n\nVery true, Boz, although Manchester City's deal attracted criticism at the time, not least because Howard Bernstein, the council's chief executive, is known to be a big City fan. He was also a member of the Olympic Delivery Authority, by the way, and I'm sure would have advocated a football legacy.\n\nUpton Park represents a piece of football history and not just English football history. They are just going to tear it down? Sad. Zacc Xav, Colombia.\n\nIt was a football ground. Some good stuff happened there, some bad stuff too, and a lot of days long forgotten. Having never been champions, the greatest moments in West Ham's history mostly took place elsewhere, not least at Wembley Stadium.\n\nThe Daily Mail conveniently forgets the stadium was built and costed as a temporary structure for dismantling at the end of the Olympics. Jimb366, Beckenham.\n\nYes, and what spiffing value that would have been.\n\nNo, not a running track. Can't they hide it at least? Splat444, United Kingdom.\n\nThey will. Artificial turf and the dug outs will sit on top when football is played.\n\nWest Ham should be in East Ham at Upton Park supporting local traders. Now they've moved to Stratford next to Westfield's shopping centre and to a stadium that is pretty bland and non-traditional. Pink Panther, Durham.\n\nI don't know if you have walked down Green Street lately, mate, but I'd say the local independent traders and the local football club have very different clienteles. Unless the lads in the Bobby Moore Stand have started wearing saris.\n\nWest Ham will never fill 54,000 and now the club are talking about increasing it to 66,000. Who is going to finance these extra seats? Joe Public again. Dodger, United Kingdom.\n\nNo, West Ham.\n\nThere is a reason why other football clubs have not raised official objections to West Ham moving to Stratford. As businesses, they know that every rule was followed and scrutinised during the bidding process. Deegee, London.\n\nAlthough if it takes off, I wouldn't put it past a few of them having a last minute scream up.\n\nThis deal is like going into an estate agent and saying: 'I like this four bedroom house, but before I rent it I want the owner to make it six bedrooms and add a conservatory. When that's done, I'm only going to pay you \u00a31,000 a month instead of the \u00a33,000 a month you could get and then I want the owner to give me \u00a31,100 a month towards my bills while I get to keep all the wages. Oh, and they can come and cook my meals for me too. As an extra, they can come and host a BBQ here in the summer when I'm away for two weeks. Deal?' Rob, Brentwood.\n\nNo, it's not like that. Not in any way is it like that. Who was willing to pay three times West Ham's rent and hand over all the benefits? You're talking twaddle.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium is currently being prepared to host games for the upcoming Rugby World Cup\n\nI would love to go to more matches but simply cannot afford it. This game was meant for the working class person, but it's simply not now. The footballers get richer, and play with no passion or pride. This stadium should have been used for the junior leagues, and split it in two. We paid for it, let our youngsters use it. Mamadi, Sandwell.\n\nFirstly, one of the benefits of West Ham having the stadium is affordable tickets. Secondly \u2013 are you serious.\n\n'What's that over there?'\n\n'It's the Olympic Stadium, mate. It holds 54,000 people.'\n\n'And who is playing there right now?'\n\n'Newham Under 12s.'\n\nI think Sullivan, Gold and Brady only took over the club with the Olympic Stadium strongly as their ultimate goal. As a long-standing West Ham fan with many memories of Upton Park, that will always be our home. The choice of either a compact history and memory-filled homely ground in the centre of the community or a cookie-cutter multi-purpose soulless venue to me is a no-brainer. Personally, it breaks my heart to see this move. Davey C, North Vancouver.\n\nYes, Dave, but you live in Canada. So it's really not your concern anymore. If we want an opinion on where the Whitecaps should play, we'll be in touch.\n\nThese three parasites had this already planned when they ran Birmingham. TNinfiniti, Newcastle.\n\nWell, that certainly makes sense. Sullivan and Gold bought Birmingham City in 1993, Olympics awarded to London in 2005. That's one hell of a long game they were playing. Equally, buying a club that was \u00a3120m in debt in January 2010, when football clubs weren't even entertained as part of the Olympic legacy process until May 2010. Anyway, fair play to them if they did see it coming. They still had to become the preferred owners or tenants. It was still a gamble.\n\nFootball club on benefits \u2013 a Channel 5 documentary on the way. This is the same embarrassing, silly little club that kicked out Bobby Moore for not having a ticket. Crabstix, United Kingdom.\n\nYou can hardly hold the current owners responsible for that. David Sullivan, as the proprietor of Sport newspapers, was one of the few people to give Moore a job. It was more than the Football Association, or any major club in the country, did.\n\nThank you, West Ham, for saving this wonderful stadium. British athletics will now benefit for the next century and have the world class venue it has been missing. Everyone wins including the local population and the taxpayer who will turn a profit instead of all the money spent on the Olympics going to waste. The only people complaining are fans of other football teams. William Jones, England.\n\nAthletics gets its major stadium for one month each year. In 2017, that month will be used to host the IAAF World Championships \u2013 without doubt there is benefit to other sports from West Ham's tenancy. It's not just about football. And now, a small change of pace.\n\nI don't think sacking Sam Allardyce was a good idea. These clubs never learn. I bet Blackburn and Newcastle wished they had stuck with him now. Say what you want but he keeps teams up. West Ham played some decent stuff under him, too, as did Bolton \u2013 and he gets results. West Ham would never have lost 4-3 to Bournemouth under Allardyce. Anyway, even if they did play hoof ball so what? Manchester United have spent \u00a3300m and play boring football and but the Daily Mail can't get enough of Louis van Gaal. I'd rather have Allardyce than Roy Hodgson as England manager as well. Star Lord, London.\n\nWe get it \u2013 you like Sam Allardyce. Now for the alternate view\u2026\n\nWatching paint dry comes to mind. One of the main reasons our national squad is so poor, is managers like Allardyce, Mick McCarthy and Tony Pulis with their seventies brand of football. Physical, long ball, break a player's leg if he gets past you. I welcome Eddie Howe at Bournemouth and Garry Monk at Swansea trying to take the game into the 21st century. I include Slaven Bilic in that statement as his teams are physically strong but also play some nice stuff. Welcome1andall, Bedford.\n\nI'm a West Ham fan and I stuck by Allardyce but his form in the last five months was shocking. It was clear he needed to leave, take a break and will come back strong. The club no doubt saw this but it would have been stupid to sack him before the end of last season. In the end, that bad run of games made him toxic. JFK, Hornchurch.\n\nSeeing Sam slumped in his chair chewing gum and looking totally defeated is the image that has stuck with me from last season. He'd had enough and needed a break. Compare him to the Allardyce that appeared on Sky and Match of the Day over the weekend and it's a different man. He's rejuvenated. And by the way, he wasn't sacked. His contract expired and was not renewed. Andy H, Essex.\n\nWhether Bilic's appointment works out is another matter, it is not secret that West Ham lost their first choice, Rafa Benitez, to Real Madrid, and that David Moyes did not want to return from Spain just yet. As far as Allardyce goes, I just think the relationship had run its course. He needed a break, they needed a fresh approach. And JFK is right about the last months of the season. West Ham won twice in the league after January 18, both 1-0 wins, at home to Sunderland and Burnley. And one point to make to the gentleman from Bedford. Tony Pulis's teams do not play bad football, and Mick McCarthy's certainly do not. Mick has always been an ambitious coach, ever since his Millwall team outplayed George Graham's Arsenal many years ago.\n\nSlaven Bilic's reign got off to the perfect start but the Hammers have suffered two disappointing results since\n\nRafa Benitez was West Ham's first choice to replace Allardyce, but he returned to Spain to coach Real Madrid\n\nWhat happens if they get relegated? Total farce. John, Deal.\n\nActually, history indicates relegation doesn't make much difference to West Ham's attendance. They lost 2,561 fans the last time and 3,265 the time before that. In 1991, they attracted more fans in the second tier than they did in the first the following season.\n\nIf West Ham is just a tenant why can't Spurs negotiate a one-year tenancy with the LLDC, playing on alternates dates to West Ham, rather than moving to the smaller Stadium MK, 52 miles out of town? There's probably a reasonable explanation \u2013 but I'd like to hear it. Walid El-Saleh, Australia.\n\nA straightforward explanation, certainly. As anchor tenants West Ham can veto any usage that could negatively affect their business. So if the LLDC wanted to hold a monster truck rally on the pitch the night before a fixture against Manchester United, the club could, very reasonably, say no. West Ham would want at least a year, maybe two, as the sole football tenants at the stadium to establish their identity. I think that's fair, but it means their available dates do not fit into Tottenham's calendar. Chelsea, if they cannot secure Wembley, would appear more realistic partners.\n\nShall go out and buy myself a nice little black number and wait for the Women and Kids Free adverts. NCN Team JA, London.\n\nYou sound like you're just looking for an excuse, mate.\n\nAs a taxpayer, I get punished for others mistakes and for corporate fat cats feeding off me and other hard working British citizens. This pile yields no financial benefit or interest to either me or my family. Why should I and others have to contribute for another iconic piece of junk? I would rather pay an outright fee to fill this big hole with concrete and be done with it. Football clubs, businesses and any others using the stadium should incur the entire cost. Once again, another fine example of British people being robbed of their hard earnings left, right and centre. Andy Odysseos, London.\n\nRight, so we all pay just for what we use, yes? So I can pull out of your family's education, local radio stations beyond London and all public works that are not in my area or do not fit my narrow range of interests; or are you going to grow up and realise that this is not how a nation works? Our taxes fund millions of projects and benefits, some of which we use, some we don't. Your cliched rant against the corporate fat cats is thinly disguised selfishness.\n\nSo Leyton Orient would not have been interested, given the same deal West Ham secured? Tell that to a dead donkey and it will get up and kick you. Tottenham were always known to be interested in moving to the stadium but were never offered the luxury of the unbelievable contract West Ham got. Wonder why?

2012 Olympic Games", "text": "The billions of pounds spent on the London Olympics was promised to create a legacy of sporting activity for the nation.\n\nBut the latest figures show that participation in grassroots sports each week is plummeting.\n\nThe number of people aged 16 and above taking part in sport at least once a week has slumped by 400,000 since 2012, according to figures highlighted by the Local Government Association.\n\nThey show that, in 2014-2015, 15.5million took part in sport in England, down from 15.9million in 2011-12.\n\nVast amounts of public money were spent on the Olympics. The initial cost of the 2012 games spiralled upwards from an initial estimate of \u00a32.4billion in 2005, reaching an estimated \u00a38.8billion by the close of the games\n\nOf the 46 sports assessed, only six \u2013 athletics, cycling, netball, table tennis, archery and fencing \u2013 have shown a significant rise in participation.\n\nCouncils warn a 'couch potato' culture is worsening our obesity crisis. Ian Stephens, from the LGA, which represents councils, said: 'We are in the midst of a full-blown obesity crisis which is being exacerbated by plunging levels of grassroots sports participation. This is creating a lost generation of obese kids and putting the NHS under enormous pressure.'\n\nThe huge cost of 'couch potato' culture is highlighted by figures that show 135 diabetes sufferers have a leg, foot or toe amputated each week, with four in five of these amputations preventable. It is estimated that obesity costs the NHS \u00a34.2billion a year and physical inactivity about \u00a31.1billion.\n\nVast amounts of public money were spent on the Olympics. The initial cost of the 2012 games spiralled upwards from an initial estimate of \u00a32.4billion in 2005, reaching an estimated \u00a38.8billion by the close of the games.\n\nIn 2008, then-Olympics minister Tessa Jowell said the aims of the games were to 'get more people active' and 'inspire young people through sport'.\n\nShe recently admitted that the 'legacy' of the games had not worked. She told Radio 4's Today programme: 'My particular concern is that the second legacy promise was to transform a generation of young people through sport.\n\n'Actually, children in school now are playing less sport than they were in 2009. That's why it is a wasted opportunity.'\n\nThe number of people aged 16 and above taking part in sport at least once a week has slumped by 400,000 since 2012, according to figures highlighted by the Local Government Association\n\nIn 2008, then-Olympics minister Tessa Jowell said the aims of the games were to 'get more people active' and 'inspire young people through sport'\n\nThe Conservative Government promised a strategy to increase participation, the results of which are expected in the coming months.\n\nLast month sports minister Tracey Crouch said: 'A significant amount of public funding has been invested in sport in the last decade but the results simply aren't good enough. The recent downward trend in participation has demonstrated that the current approach has had its day.'\n\nSwimming is still the most popular sport \u2013 with 2.5million taking part each week \u2013 but 390,700 fewer went swimming in the past year. The number of swimmers has dropped by 729,000 in the past decade.\n\nSport England has a \u00a3500million budget to boost sports participation between 2013 and 2017.\n\nA spokesman for Sport England said that since 2005, when the 2012 games were awarded to London, participation has gone up from 14million taking part in sport to the current level of 15.5million.\n\nNot everyone has backed the drive for increased participation in sport. Professor Allyson Pollock, of Queen Mary University of London, warned in the British Medical Journal that high levels of school rugby-related injuries were a cause for concern \u2013 with 12 per cent of rugby-playing pupils suffering injuries that mean they could not play for seven days.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/12/26161954-0-image-m-29_1584619649317.jpg",

league a chance to create a legacy in London and he hopes he can inspire the next generation as the athletes did on the same ground in 2012.\n\nEngland will become the first rugby league team to play in the iconic stadium when they take on number one ranked New Zealand on Saturday.\n\nThe home side lead the three-match series 1-0 after a brilliant 26-12 comeback victory last weekend in Hull and with 24 hours to go until the next Test 45,000 tickets have already been sold.\n\nEngland's Tom Burgess applauds the fans in Hull after a brilliant 26-12 comeback victory against New Zealand\n\nProp Tom Burgess practises contact in training ahead of facing New Zealand at the Olympic stadium\n\nBurgess attempts to retain possession for England under the challenge from New Zealand's defence\n\nAnd Burgess says they are ready to clinch the series in London, putting on a show for the southern fans at the same time.\n\n\u2018The turf is hallowed with the amount of stars that were there in 2012 so to be walking through the same changing rooms and tunnels as they walked through is going to be a great experience. I can\u2019t wait,\u2019 said Burgess.\n\n\u2018I love that word, legacy. It is probably one of the main things as a sports player.\n\n\u2018You get trophies and things like that but if you can leave a legacy that is probably the biggest thing you can do.\n\n\u2018To think that you could inspire someone to play league in the South by putting on a good show this weekend is amazing. It shows what the main focus is about.\n\n\u2018I loved watching the Olympics and I remember seeing Mo Farah and Jess Ennis win. It was unbelievable. Yorkshire got a lot of medals too!\n\nThe England squad celebrate a try during their 26-12 comeback victory last weekend in Hull\n\n\u2018There will be a lot of southerners there and hopefully it is a chance to spread the game around the country \u2013 it can only be good for rugby league.\u2019\n\nWith 65 per cent of tickets sold to fans with London and South East postcodes this weekend is a chance to show that league is not just a northern sport.\n\nAnd coach Steve McNamara agreed with Burgess \u2013 saying he felt the Olympic legacy close to home so knows the importance of this fixture.\n\nThe England squad prepare to take on New Zealand at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford on Saturday\n\nSteve McNamara says 'playing in the Olympic Stadium excites everyone, the players, the staff, everyone'\n\n\u2018My daughter was not really fully engrossed in sport at that stage but I remember my wife ringing me and saying \u201cyou won\u2019t believe this. Grace has got up at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, put the Olympics on and sat there 12 hours a day watching it.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018You here these stories about inspiring a generation and that was it for her \u2013 she joined a rowing club and is a rower now. That was my overriding memory from the Olympics.\n\n\u2018Playing in the Olympic Stadium excites everyone, that\u2019s the players, the staff, everyone.\n\n\u2018It looks pretty sensational in terms of how they have transformed it from an athletics arena to a multi-purpose ground. We want to top the occasion off with a really good performance and a win.\u2019\n\nThe Olympic Stadium in east London, Statford, will host England versus world No 1 side New Zealand\n\nAnd with the series there for the taking Burgess knows England will have to be ready for battle.\n\n\u2018We know that New Zealand will want to make amends so we have to keep improving our game,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018Their main asset is physicality. But they have good footwork as well as size which can be hard to handle. They have got some very talented players across the park.\u2019\n\nWith Tom's brother Sam returning to the sport the England boys will be hoping to ride the wave of appreciation for their game come Saturday afternoon.\n\nSam Burgess, in World Cup action for England in 2013, has announced his return to play rugby league", "images":

Olympic legacy cultural quarter because the buildings are boring 'great lumps' that don't belong in an already 'bleak' area.\n\nThe project, dubbed Olympicopolis, includes a new campus for the London College of Fashion, the V&A East, and Sadler's Wells in Statford, near the Olympic Stadium.\n\nThe brand new cultural quarter was supposed to be an inspiring vision that would complete the Olympic legacy, bringing culture and thousands of jobs to East London.\n\nArchitects have slammed plans for a \u00a31.3billion Olympic legacy cultural quarter (pictured, artist's impression) because the buildings are boring 'great lumps' that don't belong in an already 'bleak' area\n\nThe park would include the V&A East, which would house exhibitions on the waterfront in Startford\n\nThere would also be a 550-seat theatre at Sadler's Wells, near the Olympic Aquatics Centre in East London\n\nThe London College of Fashion campus (pictured, artist's impression) will accommodate 6,000 new students\n\nBut leading architects has criticised the project, describing the uninteresting buildings as characterless warehouses that may end up as useless white elephants\n\nBut leading figures within culture have criticised the project, describing the uninteresting buildings as characterless warehouses that may end up as useless white elephants.\n\nSir Simon Jenkins, former chairman of the National Trust, said: 'The area is just so bleak that the last thing it needs are these great warehouses,' reports The Times.\n\nHe added: The sadness of these legacy sites is that we always end up with huge inflexible buildings that don't relate to the street pattern of East London at all.'\n\nArchitect Ian Ritchie, from the Royal Academy of Arts, said: 'The individual buildings do not strike one as being particularly interesting, nor together. Somehow they are fighting each other.'\n\nThe project was dubbed Olympicopolis because it was meant to rival Albertopolis, the collection of buildings, including the Natural History Museum, in Kensington, spearheaded by Prince Albert.\n\nBut many experts claim the project, due to bring 3,000 jobs to the area of East London and a \u00a32.8billion boost to the economy, will not compare to the quarter alongside Hyde Park.\n\nRecent criticism is another blow for the project, due to be completed by 2021, after the Washington-based Smithsonian Institute pulled out of its plans to open its first foreign museum in the quarter.\n\nThis graphic shows the layout of where the Olympics were held and where the new project, which is supposed to be a part of the 2012 legacy, will be\n\nThe Washington-based Smithsonian Institution pulled out of its plans to open its first foreign museum in the quarter, and will instead collaborate on exhibitions with the V&A (pictured, artist's impression)\n\nInstead it will collaborate on exhibitions with the V&A East, 60,000 ft sq, which will be half the size of what was originally proposed.\n\nSadler's Wells will have a 550-seater theatre for the digital age and the London College of Fashion campus will accommodate 6,000 new students.\n\nThere will also be a second campus for University College London, catering for up to 3,000 students, which will be its single largest expansion since it was founded in 1826.\n\nThe scheme will attract 1.5 million visitors a year and deliver a \u00a32.8bn boost to the economy of Stratford, according to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC).\n\nRosanna Lawes, Executive Director of Regeneration at theLLDC said: 'Stratford and east London are changing fast.\n\n'In a few short years we will see not only a new cultural and education district in east London with some of the world's leading institutions sitting in the heart of the Park, but new neighbourhoods and business districts and hugely successful sporting venues delivering on the legacy promises made for the 2012 Games.", "images":

And Rio will be hearing it a lot during and after the 2016 Games, which begin today amid much razzmatazz in the city\u2019s Maracana stadium.\n\nFor London, four years on, it triggers heated debate, especially in and around the Olympic Park \u2014 now rebranded the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park \u2014 where it\u2019s sometimes hard to see the homes for the cranes.\n\nBut walking around what used to be the athletes\u2019 village, which has become the East Village, just outside the park, is to witness a new London neighbourhood that could prove the sceptics wrong.\n\nSuccess: East Village in Stratford was the athletes\u2019 quarters for the London Games\n\nThe high rises where the likes of Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis took up temporary residence in the summer of 2012 might not be to everyone\u2019s taste, but the 67 acres on which they sit comprise nearly 3,000 flats, with 95 per cent occupancy.\n\nThere are two landlords: Get Living London, which manages 1,439 homes that are rented out at normal market values, and Triathlon Homes, which runs the affordable housing element, which includes offering subsidised rents and a shared ownership scheme.\n\nGet Living London\u2019s rents (it charges no administration fees and offers residents tenancy agreements of up to three years) go from \u00a3395 per week for a one-bedroom apartment to \u00a3770 per week for a four-bedroom townhouse. Triathlon\u2019s renters can pay less than \u00a3200 a week for a two-bedroom flat.\n\n\u2018What we\u2019ve got is a rented village and the question now is how far and quickly can we grow a sustainable community,\u2019 says Bernadette O\u2019Shea, of Triathlon Homes, a joint venture between the private and public sector involving two housing associations and an urban and investment company called First Base.\n\nOlympics: Gymnast Beth Tweddle\n\nHuge effort has been made on the community front. With the Westfield shopping centre so close, small, independent retailers have been encouraged to set up business around Victory Park. There are playgrounds and outside exercise areas; green spaces with trees and wild flower meadows, pubs and restaurants.\n\nOn Sundays, there is a regular food and arts and crafts market, and last week Beth Tweddle, GB\u2019s bronze medal winner for gymnastics at the London Games, opened a Summer of Sport programme offering free outdoor fitness classes.\n\nBeyond the East Village, it\u2019s very much a case of construction work in progress.\n\nResidents moved in earlier this year to the first building at Chobham Manor, one of five new neighbourhoods planned within the park itself.\n\nPrices started at \u00a3375,000 for a one-bedroom flat and all Chobham\u2019s 259 units have sold apart from one \u2014 a five-bed townhouse on the market for \u00a31,050,000.\n\n\u2018We were renting in Stoke Newington when our landlord announced he was selling up,\u2019 says Suzanne Duffy, 44, who moved to East Village 18 months ago with her partner and two young children.\n\n\u2018I was surprised that we ended up here, but we absolutely love it.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s exciting to be part of something that is evolving and having access to so many great sports facilities is wonderful.\u2019\n\nSuzanne\u2019s oldest child attends the nearby Chobham Academy School, which has just been rated \u2018outstanding\u2019 by Ofsted.\n\nNext to the school is the Sir Ludwig Guttmann Health and Wellbeing Centre, housing a doctors\u2019 surgery, dentist and chemist, and offering a walk-in service for all kinds of health issues.\n\nChobham Manor eventually will provide 849 homes and in total 6,800 new homes are planned for the park over the next ten years.\n\nWhat both East Village and the rest of the park share are extraordinarily good transport links. Indeed, Stratford is now second only to King\u2019s Cross as the most connected part of the capital.\n\nThere are two Underground lines, the Docklands Light Railway, an overground train line and Stratford International (hop on here and hop off in Paris, or go seven minutes the other way to St Pancras).\n\nDetailed plans for the so-called Olympicopolis quarter (a nod to Albertopolis, the cluster of museums and academic institutions in South Kensington) on the Stratford waterfront, featuring an off-shoot of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the London College of Fashion and Sadler\u2019s

"text": "London Assembly members have demanded to see the financial accounts of the company that owns West Ham's London Stadium home amid concerns it is heading towards insolvency.\n\nThe centrepiece of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games is owned by E20 Stadium LLP, a joint venture between the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) and Newham Council.\n\nDespite having West Ham as an anchor tenant, the \u00a3752million stadium has been dogged by financial concerns as the price tag for converting it from an athletics venue to a football ground, and vice-versa, has repeatedly surpassed estimates.\n\nThere are fears the owners of West Ham's London Stadium are heading towards insolvency\n\nThis has led the assembly's budget and performance committee to take the rare step of issuing a summons notice for E20's 2016/17 accounts.\n\nIn a statement, the committee's chairman Gareth Bacon said: 'This company spends vast amounts of public money and we know it is in financial difficulty.\n\n'But we have been prevented from seeing the accounts of E20 Stadium LLP. Why?\n\n'The assembly needs this information immediately so we can assess whether (London Mayor Sadiq Khan) is making the right decisions when it comes to the London Stadium and Olympic legacy.\n\n'The assembly needs to do its job of scrutinising the issues that matter to London, unhindered.'\n\nLondon Assembly members have demanded to see the financial accounts of E20 Stadium LLP\n\nThe stadium has been dogged by financial concerns despite West Ham's tenancy\n\nKhan announced a review into the Stratford venue last November and is scheduled to receive a much-delayed report on the matter from accountancy firm Moore Stephens by the end of this month. It is hoped that this report will be published before the end of the year.\n\nHowever, assembly members, whose job it is to hold the mayor to account, are clearly losing patience and E20 now has two weeks to hand over its most recent set of annual accounts.\n\nEarlier this month during a two-hour session at the assembly, the outgoing chief executive and new chairman of LLDC were asked to explain how the stadium's conversion bill rose by \u00a351million in 2016 alone and what they planned to do about it.\n\nAnswers were thin on the ground, though, beyond confirming what is now widely known about the real cost of moving the stadium's temporary seating into and out of position so it can be used for athletics, concerts, football and other events.\n\nIt is understood, for example, that it cost \u00a38million to transform West Ham's new home into the venue for this summer's World Athletics Championships and back again, instead of the original estimate of \u00a3300,000.\n\nThe cost of switching it from an athletics to a football venue has cost more than expected\n\nIt cost \u00a38million to alter the venue for the 2017 World Athletics Championships and back again\n\nThese revelations have led some to ask if West Ham's tenancy deal, which at just \u00a32.5million a year has been described as the 'deal of the century', should be revisited.\n\nAnd there have also been reports that E20 could be placed in administration to allow the whole operation to be restructured.\n\nAn LLDC spokesperson said: 'LLDC and Newham Council are working closely with E20, the London Stadium's owners, to address the long-standing financial challenges in the best interests of the residents of Newham and Londoners.\n\n'A decision about the future of E20 and the stadium will be made by the Mayor alongside the publication of the Moore Stephens review.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg",

been announced.\n\nAn independent review was published on Friday morning, which said there had been 'a catalogue of errors' leading to massively increased costs after the conversion from the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nIt was a 'bungled decision that has left the taxpayer to foot an annual loss of around \u00a320 million', the review said.\n\nThe Hammers pay \u00a32.5m a year in rent to use London Stadium for home fixtures\n\nSadiq Khan lamented a the errors of decision-making in transforming London Stadium\n\nMr Khan said: 'I ordered the review into the finances of the London Stadium to understand how key decisions were made about its transformation and why costs were allowed to spiral out of control.\n\n'What has been presented is simply staggering. Not for the first time, it reveals a bungled decision-making process that has the previous Mayor's fingerprints all over it.'\n\nMr Khan ordered the investigation after it had been revealed that the bill to taxpayers for converting the centrepiece of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games into a multi-purpose venue had climbed to \u00a3323m.\n\nLondon Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC), the body which operates the stadium for the Greater London Authority, admitted problems with the venue's retractable seating were the biggest cause of the rise in costs.\n\nPremier League side West Ham, who have a 99-year lease on the 60,000-seat stadium, made a one-off contribution of \u00a315m to the conversion costs and pay \u00a32.5m a year in rent. The total price tag for the stadium, which also has a new roof, is estimated to be \u00a3752m.\n\nMr Khan commissioned a review by forensic accountants Moore Stephens in March 2017, and the 169-page report warned the cost to the public is never going to be recovered, while the stadium would also continue to lose up to around \u00a320m every year.\n\n'Boris Johnson clearly panicked when faced with legal challenges about West Ham and Newham's joint bid to take ownership of the stadium and then decided to re-run the bid process with the taxpayer taking all the risks and footing almost the whole bill. You simply couldn't make it up,' Mr Khan said.\n\n'The fact he also failed to properly examine the transformation costs or the entirely inadequate estimates for moving the retractable seats leaves us squarely in the dire financial situation we are in.\n\nDavid Sullivan (left) and David Gold (right) managed to overcome Tottenham in a bidding war\n\nThe Hammers welcomed Sadiq Khan's decision to step in and offer new lea\n\n'I am determined to put the London Stadium towards a stronger financial footing and secure its long-term future, but I'm under no illusion that this is going to take time and some real commitment from all partners to make this work.'\n\nWest Ham issued a statement in response to the report, which said the club had 'entered a fair and competitive tender process' as they were selected as anchor tenant.\n\nThe Premier League club view the Concession Agreement signed in 2013 as 'a watertight, legally-binding contract' and remain 'absolutely committed to its terms for the entire 99-year duration'.\n\nWest Ham will 'continue to devote our absolute commitment to London Stadium' but added 'our first priority in this sense is always to act in the best interests of our supporters'.\n\n'We fully concur that West Ham United has played a significant part in the most successful regeneration programme in the history of the modern Olympics, however the stadium itself craves renewed leadership and direction and we welcome the Mayor's decision to step in and deliver this. West Ham United is firmly behind him,' the statement concluded.\n\nA statement said the club: 'Continue to devote absolute commitment to London Stadium'\n\nThe Moore Stephens report said the decision to transform the stadium and enter into contract with West Ham was 'made on incorrect financial estimates and an insufficient appreciation of the critical commercial and financial risks'.\n\nThe report added: 'It is our opinion that the financial estimates were incorrect not because they were estimates, but because there were errors in their calculation, compilation and presentation.'\n\nSources close to former London Mayor Boris Johnson, now the Foreign Secretary, rejected the criticisms.\n\nAn ally of Mr Johnson said: 'No other city has an Olympic legacy like London's - all seven venues on the park are in private hands, with millions of visitors a year, and a positive economic legacy for east London. The stadium has a secure future with athletics and football.\n\n'The mistakes belonged to Khan's Labour predecessor Ken Livingstone and the Blair government. Signing off on a stadium fit only for athletics was a massive error. The only option for Boris was conversion to a multi-use venue.\n\n'If Sadiq Khan wants to try and blame someone he should blame his New Labour pals and the old Labour Mayor for their catastrophic planning failures.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/19/26088038-0-image-a-1_1584474927710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif",

to deliver its biggest festivals to tyrannical governments such as China, Russia and Qatar and while politicians continue to stand idly by when it suits them, the spectre of 1936 will always linger.\n\nBoris Johnson has hit the headlines once again following his controversial World Cup remarks\n\nA former general secretary of FIFA, Jerome Valcke - now disgraced, but aren't they all - admitted as much at a symposium five years ago.\n\n'Less democracy is sometimes better for organising a World Cup,' said Valcke. 'When you have a very strong head of state who can decide, as maybe President Vladimir Putin can do in 2018, then that is easier for us as organisers than a country such as Germany, where you have to negotiate at different levels.'\n\nYou can pretty much guess the German leader who FIFA would have been able to rub along with - and it isn't Angela Merkel.\n\nJohnson was the first minister to talk of boycotting Russia after Putin's regime brought chemical warfare to the streets of Salisbury, but he wasn't so outspoken 10 years ago when, as London Mayor, he was on handover duty at the Beijing Olympics.\n\n'We have been dazzled, we have been impressed, we have been blown away by these Beijing games,' he told a press conference following a meeting with his mayoral equivalent. He added that while criticisms of China's human rights record could not be overlooked he had not raised the issue at that morning's gathering.\n\n'I don't think you will necessarily achieve what you want in this context by showboating and grandstanding,' he said, sagely. You'd pay good money for a line like that over the West End.\n\nFast forward 10 years and our foreign secretary could win Mastermind with showboating and grandstanding as his specialist subject.\n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing this week, dropping 1936 into the conversation. Immediately, he conjured images of the 2018 World Cup being used by Putin much as Hitler and film-maker Leni Riefenstahl used the Berlin Games.\n\nHowever, Johnson wasn't as a critical of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the political issues\n\nRiefenstahl's documentary, Triumph of the Will covered the 1934 party congress in Nuremberg - a beautifully directed depiction of a purely evil ideology. In 1938, she made Olympia which, while ground-breaking in technique and featuring extensive footage of Jesse Owens, was still a work commissioned for propaganda purposes by, quite literally, a bunch of Nazis. Riefenstahl was touring America promoting her film when news broke of Kristallnacht, the most significant pogrom against Germany's Jews and she was asked to leave.\n\nJohnson is an intelligent man and knew the power of his allusion - just as he knew what he was ignoring in 2008. The opening ceremony in Beijing was as triumphant a piece of propaganda as anything Riefenstahl conjured. It was spectacular, lavish, magnificently executed, perfect to the last step, exquisitely performed.\n\nIt was also achieved with the total subjugation of the participants.\n\nThe 900 soldiers unrolling the scroll that was the centrepiece of the ceremony had to wear nappies, because they were forced to stay hidden for seven hours and not even allowed a toilet break. The three-minute umbrella dance required six months of training, for between 14 and 15 hours each day.\n\nThe young girls auditioning had to be pretty, above 1.66 metres tall and prepared to strip naked for the judges, who then measured their body proportions. Not only did Britain's political class have nothing to say about that, some even chided the sceptics.\n\nThe 1936 Olympics were used as a propaganda vehicle by Adolf Hitler for the Nazi regime\n\n'You can get big headlines back home by slating the oppressive regime,' said Tessa Jowell, then Minister for the Olympics, 'but there is a risk of going too far.'\n\nNot now, it would seem. Now, no analogy is beyond bounds, no standing too grand, no show too boating. So, will England boycott? Probably not, because it costs money. There is a risk if England withdrew in isolation that FIFA would impose sanctions, including suspension and financial penalties.\n\nExile from FIFA would not just take England out of the 2018 World Cup, but the 2019 Women's World Cup and the Under 17 and Under 20 World Cups, in which England are defending champions, due to take place next year.\n\nSuspension from FIFA could also exclude England from UEFA qualification from the 2020 European Championship, the final stages of which are to be held at Wembley, plus the World Cup in 2022.\n\nWhere this would leave English clubs in European competition is also unknown. It could be that English suspension is limited to the national team, but UEFA club tournaments are also, strictly, under FIFA's remit.\n\nThere would be hundreds of millions at stake were England forced out of the Champions League.\n\nThat is after FIFA starts hitting the FA for liability costs regarding loss of revenue from commercial agreements.\n\nAn automatic fine of \u00a3190,000 would be nowhere near the half of it. Participation revenue alone amounts to \u00a36.8m - and once FIFA have been paid out, the FA would need to address penalty clauses in their own sponsorship deals with Vauxhall, Nike and other commercial partners.\n\nTensions are high between Vladimir Putin's Russia and Britain after a spy was poisoned\n\nTheir only, faint, hope of avoiding a catastrophe would be if they could persuade FIFA that a boycott was not a boycott at all, but a safety measure following advice from the Foreign Office.\n\nIf the FA were told that players and officials might be endangered, or that supporters were not safe, they could argue they had no option but to withdraw.\n\nThe decision would, in those circumstances, not be political, but human. If fans faced harm following the team, better for the team not to travel. The problem is, the government might still want their boycott headlines.\n\nA grand, government-led gesture of defiance would play a lot better than an England team frightened to leave its own shores, under orders from civil servants. Can't see Johnson fronting up beneath that banner for the cameras.\n\nMeanwhile, on September 30, 10 teams - seven based in Britain - will contest the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi, watched by Putin from his personal box, this being his pet project. No mention of that from any politicians yet and no talk of boycotts.\n\nMaybe Johnson believes on this one, as in China, nothing will be achieved by showboating and grandstanding; not unless more showboating and grandstanding is precisely his aim.\n\nJack blow is timely warning\n\nIt is terribly unfortunate that Jack Wilshere failed to make the plane to Amsterdam on Thursday, but also timely.\n\nLike seeing Daniel Sturridge leave the field after three minutes for West Brom against Chelsea, or that occasion when Gareth Southgate travelled south specifically to watch Andy Carroll for West Ham, only for him to pull out of the game with a groin injury on the day, it is a reminder.\n\nTournaments are tough and intense and if a player is injury-prone he has to be a game-changer to be risked.\n\nSadly, as talented as Wilshere is, he has not played enough football to be considered that for England. Southgate cannot build his midfield around a potential no-show.\n\nJack Wilshere, pictured in training on Thursday, did not travel with England to Holland\n\nSanchez has to prove he is United class\n\nAlexis Sanchez was a big fish in a small pool at Arsenal. They are an elite club, yes, but Sanchez was far and away their best player. Meaning, when things did not go well, he could act the victim.\n\nHands on hips, or thrown in the air in frustration - the universal sign language for being surrounded by incompetents. It is harder to swing that at Manchester United. Now, Sanchez's team-mates are players who would walk into Arsenal's team: Marcus Rashford, Romelu Lukaku, Juan Mata, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Anthony Martial, Nemanja Matic, even Marouane Fellaini.\n\nIt may be a team in transition, as Jose Mourinho claims, but it is not one in which Sanchez can bemoan his misfortune or the shortcomings of others. He needs to prove himself a Manchester United player.\n\nAlexis Sanchez has been underwhelming since joining Manchester United from Arsenal\n\nSanchez admits he has come up short so far, but offers mitigation. 'The change of clubs was something that was very abrupt,' he says. Except it wasn't.\n\nThere was speculation about Sanchez leaving Arsenal for several years. He will have been aware of that and played like a man who was on his way for much of this season.\n\nIt is unthinkable that he was not kept abreast of developments by his agent, Fernando Felicevich, or that interested clubs did not sound out his representative over fees and personal terms. Presuming that information was passed on, a January transfer cannot have been a surprise.\n\nEqually, once the ball was rolling, the move did not happen overnight.\n\nIn November, it was known Manchester City would bid for Sanchez, amid interest from Manchester United, and the Old Trafford deal was not completed until January 22.\n\nHe had a lot of time to get his head around his transfer - even if he initially imagined he would be playing for Pep Guardiola, in blue. So he has a lot of ground to cover. He can't just stand, disgusted and persuade the world how great he could be, if only his team-mates were better.\n\nWith United's red shirt comes significant expectations. Having acted like he was too big for Arsenal, it would be an irony if Manchester United proved too big for Sanchez.\n\nSanchez needs to start turning in the performances that are expected of him as United player\n\nBentley view on 'Postman Pat' Fabio shows weakness at heart of English Game\n\nDavid Bentley has been recalling his days as an England international, under Fabio Capello. He said the players did not like it when the manager banned tomato ketchup, spoke of smuggling a McDonald's takeaway in with Jimmy Bullard when under curfew and laughed about referring to Capello as 'Postman Pat' to his face.\n\nCapello's limited English meant he wasn't in on the joke and would carry on talking, while players sniggered behind his back.\n\n'If you are tense and overthink it, you play rigid,' Bentley concludes. 'And that's England's problem.'\n\nNo. England's problem is that, given the chance to work with a coach who has won the Champions League, five Serie A titles and two La Liga titles, who was European Coach of the Year in 1994, Serie A Coach of the Year in 2005, who has been inducted into the Hall of Fame for both Italy and AC Milan, instead of receiving information and learning, England's chuckle-headed idiots preferred to gripe about fast food and sugar-laden condiments and make stupid in-jokes.\n\nMeaning they got their clock cleaned at the 2010 World Cup, not because they were too rigid, but because they couldn't master the basics of tactical organisation that are second nature to teams like Germany. Yes, Capello did look a bit like Postman Pat; but England too often look like a team with all the football nous of his black and white cat. And that's a lot more embarrassing.\n\nDavid Bentley has spoken out about his time in the England team under ex-boss Fabio Capello\n\nStrange that everyone seems so disappointed with Kevin Pietersen's farewell to cricket. Having been portrayed as a supreme egotist throughout his career, he modestly retired with a single tweet - 'Boots up, feet up' - after making seven for Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League in Sharjah.\n\nIt wasn't just his supporters who were left wanting more. Even his critics appeared to miss the opportunity for a lap of honour, a last hurrah and a chance to say goodbye to one of the sport's greatest players.\n\nYet had Pietersen gone out like John Terry did at Chelsea - a staged withdrawal from the Stamford Bridge pitch in the 26th minute, milking every last moment, not a dry eye in the house - he would have been slaughtered, as Terry was. There really is no pleasing some people.\n\nMake Hammers feel at home or lose legacy of London 2012\n\nDrip by drip, the truth is emerging about the London Stadium, the incompetence, the cost and the reality of Britain's Olympic legacy. The London Assembly budget monitoring committee heard this week that mistakes were made around the installation of the retractable seats.\n\n'There is no suggestion we were negligent, but clearly we did get it wrong,' said David Edmonds, former chairman of the London Legacy Development Corporation. The cost of this not at all negligent mistake? Roughly \u00a38million annually, when the seats need to be taken out for athletics and put back for the new football season.\n\nNeale Coleman, the LLDC's former vice-chairman, said that in retrospect the model used in Manchester after the Commonwealth Games - when the stadium was passed to Manchester City and converted for football purposes - would have been better.\n\nThe incompetence, the cost and the reality of the London Stadium legacy is ever-emerging\n\nThank the brains trust of Tessa Jowell, Ken Livingstone and Lord Coe for that - they were the ones who insisted on an Olympic legacy and would not entertain the idea of a solely football-driven takeover. Yet football is the only sport that could consistently fill the stadium and make it viable - and even that future is threatened with stadium operator E20 making the place so inhospitable for West Ham and its fans.\n\nAnd now to the final point. Edmonds admitted that the reason West Ham got such a good financial deal on the stadium was that they were the only game in town by the time it came to negotiations. Tottenham's proposal had been rejected; Leyton Orient's interest was a myth. It was West Ham, or nothing. West Ham, or empty.\n\nThe whole process has been an utter shambles and unless E20 start to make the place feel more like home for its anchor tenants, what tiny legacy remains could be lost. The politics needs to stop and the constructive solutions need to start. This is a national scandal and the size and scale of it is only just emerging.\n\nOn recent tours, it has been discovered that England's cricketers can't play against spin bowling, can't play against fast bowling and now, apparently, can't play against swing bowling either. Unless the ECB finds a country that bowls underarm, there aren't really many places to go.", "images":

Tottenham are vying with West Ham over the future of the Olympic Stadium\n\nSuch a possibility has outraged the MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, who has called on the Government to intervene in the naming of the preferred bidder in order to safeguard the future regeneration of his constituency.\n\n\n\nSpeaking during a debate in Westminster today, Lammy said: 'Can it possibly be fair that Tottenham's legacy from the Olympics is for the largest private employer to be allowed by this government to depart?\n\n\n\n'The Olympics were meant to bring a unique experience to the doorsteps of ordinary Londoners.\n\n\n\nHome: Tottenham have had plans approved to improve White Hart Lane\n\n'In N17, that experience will have a particularly bitter aftertaste should Spurs leave as a result.\n\n\n\n'Never did I imagine our successful Olympic bid would mean that residents of Tottenham, and those of Enfield, Waltham Forest and the whole of the Upper Lea Valley would have the heart and soul ripped out of their communities.\n\n\n\n'What kind of an Olympic legacy would that be?'\n\n\n\nClub officials are due to meet with Lammy and Andrew Stunell MP, the Minister for Regeneration,
