It also seems likely that in many regions, a majority of voters will cast their votes for Eurosceptic parties. This is an historic development, a seismic change. To quote Prescott's phrase, the tectonic plates are moving.\n\nAcross the EU, Eurosceptic parties are on the march.\n\nAll the established parties will have to reappraise their policies on the EU. Blair will have to abandon his hopes of joining the euro, or of ratifying the constitution. Even the Liberal Democrats may need to rethink their Euro-quisling stance.\n\nFor the Tories, this is a wake-up call. The party leadership has been trying to bridge the gap between the old dinosaurs - Clarke and Heseltine - and the vast bulk of the members and activists. But in the effort to keep a few distinguished Europhiles on-side, we are letting party activists and the public slip away.\n\nOverwhelmingly, Conservatives want a relationship with the EU based on market access, free trade, voluntary intergovernmental cooperation - and nothing more. Over and over, they say: \"In [the referendum of] 1975, we voted for a common market, not political union.\"\n\nWe have to respond to this demand, or become irrelevant to the debate. It is not enough merely to reject the euro and the constitution and to repatriate the common fisheries policy. We need to disengage from the acquis communautaire across a broad front. We need to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and the European convention on human rights. We need to commit ourselves clearly to the independence and self-determination of our country.\n\nTony Blair will call this \"withdrawal\" - although I myself prefer Bill Cash's phrase \"associate membership\". But it doesn't matter what we call it. What matters is the substance, not the semantics. This is what the British people want. This is what the Conservative party must deliver.\n\nAnd of course only a party capable of forming a government in Westminster can deliver. Ukip, a mere fringe pressure group, can talk a good story, but can achieve nothing.

New Labour was a winning political argument.\n\n\"For the first time you had the Labour party, a progressive political party, saying you can combine economic efficiency with social justice.\n\n\"I don't notice that coming back from either of the two main parties now.\n\n\"When that happens, when you actually see that big argument come the other way, then I think you are at a moment of change, but I don't notice that at the moment.\"\n\nRenewed predictions that Labour will do badly in Thursday's European and local council elections were confirmed by today's poll, which indicates that the two main parties may get the backing of just one in six adults in the European and local government elections.\n\nThe Populus poll, published in the Times today - on deadline day for postal ballots to be sent - suggested that Tory support in the European elections could fall from 36% in 1999 to about 24% this time round, while Labour support could slip from 28% to 25-26%.\n\nThe Tories' woes, due in part to them haemorrhaging support to the UK Independence party, would overshadow what also looks set to be a bad night for Labour.\n\nUkip could see its support rise from 7% to about 13% - largely at the expense of the Tories.\n\nThe Lib Dems look set to increase their number of Euro MPs and see off the challenge from the Ukip to take third place. But the anti-EU party could also gain more seats in the European parliament.\n\nThe poll also showed a majority of Tory supporters (57%) want Britain to pull out of the EU - Ukip's defining aim. The wider public favours staying in by 52.5% to 47.5%.\n\nThe government would also lose local government seats to both the Tories and the Lib Dems if the poll were to prove accurate.\n\nThe poll had further bad news for the government, showing one in seven voters in the all-postal ballot trial areas had not received ballot papers by last weekend.\n\nThe parties are campaigning fiercely to try and woo voters as the deadline for ballots looms.\n\nThe 14 million eligible voters in the four northern regions have until tonight to mark their preferences in the local and European elections, with just two days to go before Super Thursday.\n\nThousands of voters in the rest of the country who opted for all-postal ballot are under the same deadline.\n\nLabour is sending a fleet of cabinet ministers to campaign across the country, including David Blunkett in the South West region, Charles Clarke in the Northern region, Peter Hain in Wales and Tessa Jowell in London.\n\nLabour was focusing on the NHS as it sought to persuade voters to judge it on public services and not the war in Iraq.\n\nThe Tory leader, Michael Howard, is taking his charm offensive to the south-east while the Liberal Democrats were today unveiling their latest bid for votes with a new poster campaign.", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Elections+2004%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CLabour", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "08/06/2004"}, "rank_202": {"title": "Ukip soars in voter backlash", "text": "Electorate turns against Brussels across continent Table: see the results as they come in\n\nThe UK Independence party last night spearheaded a determined assault on the British political establishment in the European elections when they helped force the Labour and Conservative share of the vote down to barely half of the total, and narrowly pushed the Liberal Democrats into fourth place.\n\nAcross the country results gave consistent encouragement to Ukip, whose election star was Robert Kilroy-Silk, the former Labour MP and TV personality. He won the first of two Ukip seats in the East Midlands.\n\nAs Ukip headed for a dozen seats - compared with the three it won in 1999 - Labour appeared to be right in predicting the Tories had suffered most of the defections. The British National party also appeared to have lost out to Ukip in the rightwing contest.\n\nA rising tide of Euroscepticism with profoundly significant implications was evident in voting across Europe yesterday. But Ukip fell short of the spectacular breakthrough in British politics which it - and several polls - had predicted in its attempt to become a mass movement which aims to enfranchise voters ignored by the big parties.\n\nHowever, its surge has caught a mood of voter disaffection which also boosted the anti-war Liberal Democrats and the leftwing Respect party. But George Galloway, the ex-Labour MP, did not win a seat and cabinet ministers, loyally backing the beleaguered Tony Blair, insisted they remain on course to win a third term - despite Europe, the Iraq factor and voter scepticism about public service reform.\n\nThe likely final result may give the Tories 27 of the 78 seats, Labour 19, Lib Dems and Ukip a dozen, the Greens two.\n\nFor Downing Street there was some comfort in the news from across Europe that governing parties were being punished by alienated voters, who were also backing Eurosceptic parties in unprecedented numbers. At 38% the UK turnout, 14% up, was a record high, bucking the wider EU trend.\n\nLabour came second last night, compared with third in Thursday's council elections. With 10 out of 11 regions declared Ukip had edged into third place.\n\nUkip gained its first seat in London, and a second seat in the South West as it clearly hurt the Tories harder than Labour, which held its two Scottish and two Welsh seats against some odds. The Liberal Democrats won a seat in the north-east. Martin Bell, the ex-BBC Independent, retired after failing in the eastern region.\n\nEarly today the BBC computer suggested that the Tories will emerge on around 28% (down 8%), Labour will be on 21% (7% below its poor 1999 result), and Ukip on 18%, ahead of the Lib Dems on 15%. The Greens' Caroline Lucas hung on to her seat in the South East.\n\nThe spectacle of Mr Kilroy-Silk being outdone in Eurosceptic rhetoric by the Tories' Roger Helmer at the count in Northampton illustrated the big problem ahead for Tony Blair and Michael Howard. \"The forces of national liberation are on the march and will not take No for an answer,\" Mr Helmer said. Mr Kilroy-Silk denounced the \"corrupt, dictatorial regime in Brussels\".\n\nThe prime minister's aides dismissed claims by Mr Kilroy-Silk and his allies that Mr Blair will now not dare to sign a final version of the EU constitution at this week's Brussels summit.\n\n\"If he does he'll lose the referendum very heavily,\" said Ukip MEP Nigel Farage, who complained that the media had consistently neglected Ukip over Europe. \"The entire political class is heading in one direction and ordinary Britons are heading in the opposite direction,\" he said.\n\nSenior Labour strategists believe that Ukip will have the opposite effect by frightening voters with its talk of quitting the EU and polarising debate. \"If Ukip does well it will make the referendum more, not less winnable,\" predicted a key Blair ally.\n\nThe problem is as acute for the Tories. If Mr Howard tilts towards a harder anti-EU line, he may split his party, as the veteran pro-European Kenneth Clarke made clear yesterday. If he fails to respond to the Ukip challenge, more Tory supporters may defect unless they accept Lord Tebbit's warning yesterday: another shot across the Tory bow at the general election may hole Mr Howard's boat, he said on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost.\n\nLabour officials were relieved. \"The Tories have got a civil war on their hands,\" said one survivor of the SDP split that rendered Labour divided and impotent through much of the 1980s. In 1983 Michael Foot narrowly avoided third place against the SDP/Liberal Alliance.\n\nBut last night's fresh evidence of the break-up of the historic duopoly of the past 75 years offers no comfort to either main party. No election since the unique postwar \"coupon election\" of 1918 has seen the share of the vote enjoyed by both top parties fall below 25%.\n\nLabour's chairman, Ian McCartney, said: \"Before the campaign, the Tories said in a presentation to their own MEPs they wanted to get 42% in these elections, 'enough to win a general election'. Far from getting 42%, the Tories have failed dramatically to get anywhere near to the 36% that William Hague got in 1999, two years before they suffered a landslide defeat.\"\n\nConservative co-chairman Dr Liam Fox said: \"The Conservatives won these elections, just as we won the local elections and the Greater London assembly elections. We got the highest share of the vote and have the most MEPs. Labour's result is the worst result of a governing party in British electoral history.\"\n\nBritain's higher turnout was in marked contrast to the rest of Europe, where in the biggest election in the continent's history the 25-state average was 44.6%, a record low, and just 28.7% among the 10 new members.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2004/06/13/kilroy_silk256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48b071ac8cbb3e2fdec1d9684c216998", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2004/06/13/kilroy_silk256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c67e437eb267fc9c436fb02022b724df", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CElections+2004%2CWorld+news%2CUK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2004/06/13/kilroy_silk256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48b071ac8cbb3e2fdec1d9684c216998", "date": "14/06/2004"}, "rank_287": {"title": "Charles Grant: It's time to do your homework", "text": "For the past seven years Britain has been led by the most pro-European prime minister since Ted Heath, yet the mood of the country has never been more Europhobic. A constant stream of anti-European propaganda has helped to turn public opinion against the EU, the euro and the constitutional treaty that is under discussion in Brussels today. Too few politicians have been willing to fight back and expose the lies peddled by the sceptics. Tony Blair gives the occasional pro-European speech, but few of his ministers follow suit. So it is hardly surprising that the sceptics have, for now, won the argument about Europe.\n\nThe problem with the Labour leadership is not Euroscepticism, but rather indifference. Not many cabinet ministers know much about the EU, are interested, or think it matters. Of course, there are pro-Europeans, such as Charles Clarke, Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon. But when was the last time that one of them found the courage to make a big speech on the virtues of the EU or its draft constitution? Too often, politicians seem to think that if they speak out on Europe they will invoke the wrath of the tabloids and harm their careers. The same caution presumably explains why Labour decided to campaign in the last two European elections by talking as little as possible about Europe - a tactic that evidently failed.\n\nThe cumulative effect of this lack of leadership is that the centre of gravity of the European debate has shifted, in only a few years, from \"Should we join the euro?\" to \"Should we quit the EU?\" That shift, combined with the decision to hold a referendum on the EU constitutional treaty, poses great dangers for Britain.\n\nLegally, the treaty cannot enter into force unless all 25 members ratify it by parliamentary vote or referendum. At least half a dozen are likely to hold referendums. Many Britons - including, it seems, cabinet ministers - assume that another country is bound to vote No, so it doesn't matter very much which way Britain votes.\n\nThe truth, however, is that a No vote would have profound consequences for Britain and for Europe. There is a fair chance that all the other countries will adopt the constitution; in none of them is Euroscepticism so rampant as in Britain. If Britain alone cannot ratify, the others could try to expel it. In practice there would not be the required unanimity: Britain has many friends, notably among the Nordics and central Europeans, who would be loath to have an EU without Britain.\n\nBut no one should assume that if the British vote No, all the others will happily abandon their efforts to improve the way EU institutions work. France and Germany would probably lead a group of like-minded members into the creation of an avant-garde committed to closer integration. Jacques Chirac would not be the only leader who would want to seize the opportunity of a British No to set up a \"core Europe\" that excluded Britain and some of the troublesome central Europeans. This would have its own institutions and might focus on subjects such as economic policy coordination in the euro zone, corporate taxation, foreign policy, migration and criminal law. The existing EU would remain as an outer circle for Britain and other faint-hearted countries.\n\nOf course, Britain may not be the only country to reject the constitutional treaty. But if several countries turned it down, a core Europe would still be the most likely outcome (this assumes that France adopts the treaty, as it probably will; if France did not, both the constitutional treaty and the idea of an avant-garde would be dead). The British should not under-estimate the political will in several European capitals in favour of a new institutional club. Outside the core, Britain would still have access to the single market. But it would pay a heavy political and economic price.\n\nExcluded from many of the decisions that shaped the continent's future, Britain would often have to choose between following or opposing the leading group. Staying out of the euro is already causing problems. Last month's report from the Economist Intelligence Unit shows that the UK's share of foreign direct investment into the EU-15 fell from 28% in 1999 - the year the euro was created - to 5% in 2003. Membership of an outer circle would make Britain seem an even more peripheral country.\n\nTony Blair needs to order his ministers to do some homework on the treaty and learn how to dispel the many myths surrounding it. They must go out and explain the good things in the document, and the countless benefits of EU membership. The referendum can be won, but only if politicians find the courage to make the case for Europe, and keep doing it. Otherwise Britain will leave the European mainstream.\n\n\u00b7 Charles Grant is director of the Centre for European Reform\n\ninfo@cer.org.uk", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "17/06/2004"}, "rank_295": {"title": "Press review: What they said about the European parliament", "text": "\"With little suspense, and even less openness, Josep Borrell was elected yesterday to the presidency of the world's largest freely elected legislature,\" said theafter the 57-year-old Catalan socialist became president of the European parliament.\n\nMr Borrell won the post thanks to a pact between the centre-right European People's party (EPP) and the Party of European Socialists (PSE) to share control of the EU legislature over its five-year term. The WSJE felt the deal would do nothing to combat Euroscepticism. \"European democracy won't be built in a day,\" it said. \"But the parliament would be the place to start, if ever a start is made.\"\n\nGermany's Die Welt agreed the parliament should not be involved \"in this kind of wheeling and dealing\". It, too, complained of the \"great harm done to democracy\", which is something \"the EU urgently needs\".\n\nHowever, the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung thought the election had gone off \"without a hitch\", and joked about \"a fascinating group of MEPs from 25 countries having its usual political drama\". While some German conservatives might be upset by the election of a socialist, it said, \"German domestic politics should never set the tone in the European parliament\".\n\nYves M\u00e9ny in France's Ouest-France was in complete agreement. \"The lesson to draw is simple: no party, no country, is in a position to impose its will on the European parliament.

Instead he is embroiled in a nightmare row over politics and morality in a power struggle that has injected rare passion and drama into an EU debate - and might, just, end up bringing ordinary people a little closer to the distant institutions that represent them.\n\nIt was not clear last night whether, or how, the fight over Rocco Buttiglione, Italy's controversial candidate for the Brussels executive - the commissioner-designate for justice and home affairs - can be resolved after a marathon bout of horsetrading in the Strasbourg assembly. If it is not, then many MEPs will be cock-a-hoop. But it will be at the cost of plunging the EU into a grave and unprecedented crisis.\n\nIn any event, this is the worst start for Barroso, Maoist revolutionary turned centre-right Portuguese prime minister, taking over the presidency from the lacklustre Romano Prodi just as the EU adjusts to the reality of having 25 members and 450 million people - and is about to start years of difficult accession talks with Turkey.\n\nOn Friday, heads of government gather in Rome for a ceremony to sign the new constitutional treaty. This is designed to make the union function more efficiently and democratically. But with referendums looming in several countries, including Britain, and apathy and Euroscepticism as bad as ever, it may never take effect. And then next week the EU will have to come to terms with the result of the US presidential election, with many leaders rooting privately for John Kerry, and thus risking exaggerated expectations of a man who may speak French and like working with allies, but will probably be unable to deliver a significantly better relationship between the old and new continents. Europe, so often trapped in the gap between aspiration and reality, does not seem poised to play a bigger, more coherent role in the world stage.\n\nThat global role, though, must begin at home, and Buttiglione is not the only joker in the commission pack: MEPs also raised objections to the Dutch businesswoman appointed to take over the competition portfolio, the Hungarian unsuited to managing energy and the Danish agriculture commissioner married to a farmer enriched by CAP subsidies.\n\nNone of these candidates generated much interest beyond the Brussels beltway. But the Italian conservative and friend of the Pope has raised hackles because of his views on homosexuality, single mothers and the family - classic beliefs of the conservative Catholic that he is. Feelings ran just as high during negotiations on the EU constitution, with the Italian, Polish and Irish governments - backed by the Vatican - demanding a clear reference to Christian values, but being defeated by the secular-minded majority which decided, correctly, that this would be the wrong message to send to Europe's multicultural societies - with 12 million Muslims, as well as those Turkish wannabes.\n\nButtiglione was justified in arguing that there is a difference between law and morality, and he is entitled to his private views. But he showed a breathtaking lack of judgment in answering MEPs' questions the way he did. The row escalated when his supporters protested about an anti-Catholic \"inquisition\". Yet there is no such inquisition. Joe Borg, the Maltese commission candidate, is a staunch opponent of abortion, but that is irrelevant to his duties running fisheries policy. It is understandable that Barroso did not wish to cede too much ground to parliament. But he was foolish to reject a reshuffle that could have ended this fight quickly and simply.\n\nSome of this is the inevitable outcome of the sheer com plexity of the EU's hybrid, Heath Robinson structures. Buttiglione was nominated by Silvio Berlusconi just as Peter Mandelson was by Tony Blair, for similar reasons of domestic politics and the desire to set the policy agenda. The appointed commission president then has to find jobs for these national nominees - who must all pass muster in today's all-or-nothing vote by MEPs.\n\nIt is a good idea for the European parliament to have a bigger say in the make-up of the union's supranational executive (those \"Brussels bureaucrats\" beloved of British newspapers) and disingenuous to say it should not have one because of poor turnout - a dismal 44% last June - in the European elections. Most people know little about an institution routinely scorned as a talking shop on a gravy train - though some may remember the jaw-dropping gaffe last year when Berlusconi compared a German MEP to a Nazi camp guard. Extraordinary misjudgments and a vicious skirmish over institutional power have come together to create a moment where the stakes for Europe's disenchanted union of states and peoples are suddenly very high.\n\n\u00b7 Ian Black left Brussels this summer after four years as the Guardian's European editor\n\nian.black@theguardian.com", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "26/10/2004"}, "rank_227": {"title": "Mandelson sets out vision of EU business reform", "text": "Peter Mandelson told the CBI conference today Euroscepticism was \"an unwanted by-product\" of Labour's economic successes and could only be defeated by an \"unwavering pursuit of economic reform\".\n\nIn his first major speech as incoming EU trade commissioner Mr Mandelson, who characterised himself as a pro-European reformer, said: \"Let's not make the mistake of the anti-Europeans and confuse criticism of some European polices with rejection of Europe.\"\n\nHe warned: \"At present the prospect is of Europe's relative economic decline in the world\" and said EU nations must raise their game by becoming \"cutting-edge innovators\".\n\nIn remarks that will please the unions, Mr Mandelson held up Finland, Sweden and Denmark as models Europe should be following because of their combination of \"economic dynamism with greater social cohesion\".\n\nThe goal, he said, was to marry \"British-style economic openness and flexibility\" with continental-style investment in social and economic infrastructure, scientific research and development and public service.\n\nMr Mandelson told delegates in Birmingham: \"I recognise that in this hall and in the wider British business community there is not as much pro-European fervour as perhaps 10 or 15 years ago.\n\n\"In part, this is an unwanted by-product of the Labour government's economic record.\n\n\"In former times, successive British governments had so messed up the running of the economy that British business looked longingly to the continent, and particularly Germany, as an anchor and a model of partnership in place of our chaotic industrial relations.\n\n\"Today Britain seems to offer its own distinctive model of economic success.

It is an idea, in their view, whose time has gone, if it ever arrived,\" he said.\n\n\"I happen to see an argument for it, but the public don't embrace it and I don't think it is going to come back in that form.\"\n\nMr Mandelson was expected to have been confirmed in his new job by the time he spoke to the CBI, but he is still officially a \"commissioner designate\" following the technical withdrawal of the new team in the row with the European parliament over plans to appoint Rocco Buttiglione, who provoked controversy with remarks on single mothers and homosexuality.\n\nWith Mr Buttiglione and one other - Latvian - member of the original new team now replaced, the appointment of the 25-strong commission, including Mr Mandelson, should be a formality in a vote of European MPs in Strasbourg on November 18.\n\nMr Mandelson said: \"I had hoped that this speech would be my first public engagement as the new European commissioner for trade. I had forgotten what long experience in politics has taught me: never take anything for granted.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2004/11/08/mandy372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b746d91cad0730bff2f5b0a6fd00ffd5", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CWorld+news%2CPolitics%2CBusiness%2CEconomic+policy%2CMoney%2CUK+news%2CConfederation+of+British+Industry+%28CBI%29", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2004/11/08/mandy372.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=64fb9acad3f1cbaa3dcb10ffc63d5052"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2004/11/08/mandy372.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b746d91cad0730bff2f5b0a6fd00ffd5", "date": "08/11/2004"}, "rank_292": {"title": "'It's a very good thing. Now people can see what the options were'", "text": "'It's a very good thing. Now people can see what the options were'\n\nJohn Major is angry. He believes the \"myths and downright misrepresentation\" that surround September 16 1992, the day that came to define his government, have obscured the economic success that followed. He is angry about the way Labour has taken the credit for economic growth; angry at the way Black Wednesday has been demonised by Eurosceptics; angry about what he sees as the manipulation of the Freedom of Information Act. Angry too about claims that his own performance on the day contributed to the calamity.\n\nYesterday's publication of the Black Wednesday documents will, he hopes, put the myths to rest. \"People will see the raw, unadulterated documents. I think it is a very good thing for history,\" he says. \"People for the first time will see what the policy options were, what the difficulties were and what the long-term benefit has been.\"\n\nOn no issue is this defiance stronger than his own behaviour. He rejects as \"black propaganda\" rumours that he was unable to cope as the markets destroyed the pound. Reports that he had a breakdown are \"utter rubbish\", he says. \"That was a bit of post-event destabilisation.\"\n\nThat is not to say he found Black Wednesday easy. It was a day of \"desperate difficulty\", he recalls, though there was no panic. When he woke that morning in Admiralty House (Downing Street was being renovated) he did not know what was to come. \"It wasn't apparent until the morning began to move on quite how difficult it was going to be.\"\n\nAdmiralty House presented its own difficulties too. Some have described an isolated prime minister cut off from the Downing Street machine. He agrees there were problems - \"we didn't have all the familiar immediate information\" - but insists \"we were not seriously out of date\".\n\n\"We didn't have a market screen but we had officials coming in and out.\"\n\nMany have suggested in retrospect that Britain should have suspended its ERM membership earlier. Not so, says Mr Major. \"We had an obligation under the ERM to defend the pound.\"\n\nNorman Lamont, chancellor on the day and the man who finally had to announce to the world that his policy had fallen apart, might question that. But Mr Major insists that at the time there was no dis agreement. \"On that day we sat together and we worked together,\" he says. \"It is not the case that there were loads of disputes between us on that day. Norman supported our membership of the ERM.\"\n\nPointing to the great pile of documents made public yesterday lunchtime, he insists they do not reveal a government split over how to manage the economy. \"Norman has made it absolutely clear that we would not have got inflation down without the ERM and we would not have moved to the excellent economy we have now got if we hadn't got inflation down,\" he says.\n\nPolitical crisis\n\nSo was it a crisis at all? Yes, says Mr Major, but a political crisis, not an economic one. In the end the public, he hopes, \"will place the \u00a33.3bn cost against an economy without inflation that has lasted for 13 years and is certainly worth far more than \u00a33.3bn\". The disaster that followed Britain's exit certainly hit the Tory party. It is \"beyond a doubt\" that Black Wednesday encouraged Conservative Euroscepticism, he says - and that, in the end, killed the government.\n\nSince autumn 1992 his party has struggled in the polls, rarely rising above the mid-30s. That might change, he thinks, if his party was prepared to be bullish about what it achieved. \"It should be, shouldn't it?\" he says - the closest he gets to criticising his successors as party leader. \"I think the Conservative party should take credit for the fact that they handed over an economic legacy unmatched in recent years.\" That does not take away from the humiliation of the day. \"It was always a marginal decision in my mind whether I should have resigned. I didn't. If you ask me today was it the right decision I would still not be absolutely certain.\"\n\nHe has no doubt, though, about what is wrong with the Freedom of Information Act. \"It is quite extraordinary really that it opens up the actions of former govern ments to substantial if not complete disclosure and blocks off similar disclosures to the current government. I don't think that is equitable,\" he says.\n\nOliver Letwin yesterday said the act was being used by Labour to generate propaganda. \"It does look as if it is being operated in that way,\" Mr Major says. \"Whether this is accidental or malign it is difficult to tell,\" he adds - refusing to blame Alastair Campbell, a man he described yesterday as \"below my eyeline\". He is clear on one point: he did not try to block the release of the documents as the Times alleged in a recent report that drove him to fury.\n\nWhat the papers prove above all, he believes, is that his government killed inflation. \"In time all this will be placed in a proper context,\" he says. \"Before the release of these documents it was subject to myth, to mythology and to downright misrepresentation.\"\n\n\"Now that can't happen. So I am pleased that it has actually been published.\"\n\nEvents that brought down the pound - and the Tory party\n\n1987\n\nThen chancellor Nigel Lawson begins informally shadowing the mark in an attempt to give Britain German-style low inflation.\n\nOctober 1990\n\nJohn Major, then chancellor, takes Britain into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) - a grid system designed to tie currencies closely together in narrow fluctuation bands - at DM2.95 to the pound. The rate was widely seen as being too high and too restrictive - the pound could only fluctuate by 6% either side of the central rate.\n\nApril 1992\n\nMajor, as prime minister, wins a fourth election for the Conservatives.\n\nMid-1992\n\nGermany raises interest rates to a record 8.75% to deal with its own inflation. Britain was forced to raise rates too, to defend the pound's rate, but at a time the economy was already in a deep recession with unemployment rising towards 3 million.\n\nAugust 1992\n\nMeeting of European finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Bath. Major and his chancellor, Norman Lamont, try to persuade Bundesbank chief Helmut Schlesinger to cut German interest rates to relieve pressure on the pound. He refuses.\n\nSeptember 14\n\nItaly devalues the lira in exchange for a small rate cut from the Buba. Markets turn their attention to sterling, especially with the Buba hinting that sterling might be devalued.\n\nSeptember 16\n\nBlack Wednesday. The day dawns with the pound under intense strain at the bottom of its permitted band (DM2.778). Speculators, led by the Hungarian-born financier George Soros, are circling like vultures. \"It was an obvious bet, a one-way bet,\" he said later.\n\n9am\n\nMajor and some of his cabinet are camped in Admiralty Arch in Whitehall while No 10 is undergoing renovations and so are out of touch with news agency reports of what is happening in the markets. \"I knew very early on the game was up but could not convince my colleagues,\" Lamont said later. Over in the City, the Bank of England continues intervening, as it has to under ERM rules, buying billions of pounds on the foreign exchanges in a bid to hold the pound in its band.\n\n11am\n\nMajor and Lamont announce interest rates are to rise immediately from 10% to 12% in an attempt to stop the downward pressure on the pound by improving the attraction of holding sterling.\n\n12.45pm\n\n\"It hasn't worked - they are still selling,\" Lamont tells Major. Cabinet holds crisis meeting.\n\n2.15pm\n\nLamont and Major decide to raise interest rates from 12% to 15%, effective the following day, in a desperate, last-ditch attempt to save the pound, their reputation and their government. It fails, and the selling continues.\n\n7.40pm\n\nLamont walks out of the Treasury to tell the world that Britain is leaving the ERM. He takes back the second rate rise, leaving rates at 12%. The pound tumbles below its old ERM rate against the market. The government's defeat is total, its reputation in shreds.\n\n\"I went to bed half convinced my days as prime minister were drawing to a close ... we had suffered a great defeat,\" Major said later.\n\nSeptember 17\n\nLamont announces interest rates are being cut back to 10% again. The government has lost billions defending the pound. Soros is said to have pocketed \u00a31bn of that and becomes known as \"the man who broke the Bank of England\".", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CUK+news%2CFreedom+of+information%2CEconomic+policy", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "10/02/2005"}, "rank_305": {"title": "Dutch prepare to deliver their snub", "text": "Dutch government leaders yesterday issued desperate pleas for the public to back the European constitution as the Netherlands, in the shadow of the French vote, prepared to deliver a large snub to the EU.\n\nThree days before the Dutch vote in their sole referendum of modern times, opinion polls at the weekend put the no camp comfortably ahead, confirming a trend that has held consistently for more than a month.\n\nThe poll findings gave the no camp a lead of 14 points, with a 3% margin of error.

So now we know. This British prime minister is no sceptic, but has become a believer in the EU in just the same way that Margaret Thatcher was - Europe is fine, he reckons, if it's his Europe, on his terms. The Europe that causes problems is the one messed up by a load of bloody Europeans.\n\nHis language about the British rebate negotiation was less strident than Lady Thatcher would have used, but his coldly crisp assessment of \"sharp disagreement\" that will be difficult to bridge in Brussels today was as tough as anything he's said before an EU summit. Euroscepticism is as fashionable in London this summer as peasant and Gypsy costumes are in the Paris shops; where once it was dominated by rightwing men in ageing green blazers and regimental ties, now it is cool and moderate. Now it is New Labour.\n\nTo get a real sense of the challenge facing the British centre-left, we have to stand back a bit. The euro, which was meant to be fundamental to EU development, is completely off the Labour agenda, while on the continent the first voices calling for it to be unwound are being raised. A British referendum on the constitution is off the agenda too, which is reasonable given what happened in France and the Netherlands; but there is no plan, or even germ of an idea, about how to proceed. And by linking the British rebate to agricultural spending reform, London has effectively put the EU budget issue into cold storage.\n\nSo, to recap, the EU is in fine condition, except for its budget, its political system and its currency. Of course, it has faced many a crisis and always seems to muddle through. Yet this time a lot is at stake, and for Britain as much as anywhere. If the EU contracts in some radical way to an \"old Europe\" core, then we will be outside it, and many of the workplace and legal protections the centre-left so values will be at risk. An outer-ring Europe will have to be lower wage, more ruthless and less social democratic to survive. And if the EU actually began to collapse, as so many blithe spirits hope, the result would be far worse. Trade barriers would go up again, those borders would begin to reappear and prosperity would slide.\n\nThose who are so cheerily hailing the current chaos in Europe as just what Britain wanted should pause for thought. Imagine, for a moment, a world in which the EU did not exist. It would be a world dominated by the ruthless and often protectionist power of the United States, not balanced by any competing western system, and by the rising low-cost juggernauts of Asia. What price then a modern social-welfare state on our small cluster of offshore islands?\n\nSo the pressure on Tony Blair to manage his way through this crisis as Britain takes over the rotating presidency of the EU is intense. Yet the mood of casual Euroscepticism on the left is now so strong that there's a real chance of the prime minister shrugging and blocking his way to the end of the year. There's very little pressure at home for him to do anything else.\n\nIn cabinet discussions before his trip to Moscow, Berlin and Paris, there was a fierce debate about both the future of the constitution and the necessity to hold on to Britain's rebate. But Europhile ministers such as Patricia Hewitt and Charles Clarke apparently felt themselves pushed against the wall by the mood of hostility.\n\nJack Straw spoke at great length, and passionately, about the iniquities of the continental elites. Neither he nor the prime minister had advance warning of Peter Mandelson's carefully worded pro-Brussels speech on Monday, which suggested that Britain's rebate might be negotiable. Indeed, given that Britain is now a much richer country than when the rebate was first negotiated back in 1984 (Britain was the third poorest country in the EU then, but is fourth richest now), it is hard to disagree with Mandelson's suggestion that the new entrants should not have to contribute to Britain's rebate.\n\nYet, according to a cabinet colleague, both Blair and Straw were livid with Mandelson. It's easy to understand why they are going along with the new Labour Europe-bashing. First, the immediate reaction from Brussels to the French and Dutch referendums was absurd - just carry on, it was only the people voting, they don't matter. Next, Jacques Chirac's tactic of using the British rebate to obscure the more embarrassing and fundamental issues facing the EU was contemptible. Personal relations between Chirac and Blair have been abysmal since the Iraq war, and Chirac, like Schr\u00f6der, is on the way to retirement.\n\nSo, why not sit things out, and wait for the next generation of leaders? By going off to speak to Angela Merkel, likely to be the next German chancellor, Blair has signalled that he is doing just that. Why not let the crisis continue until others see sense?\n\nThe short answer to this is that it would be a dangerous failure of leadership, even a failure of duty. Tony Blair is now a powerful leader in the EU, freshly re-elected and with a strong economy behind him. To let the British presidency slide by, the crisis unaddressed, would be shameful. Economic reform is all very well, but this crisis is about the constitution and the budget. Someone needs to start setting out a plausible road through the mess, and it should be Britain.\n\nBefore that happens we will need a dramatic change of attitude - or \"mood\", as Mandelson described it - in London. Britain can have no moral or political authority if we refuse to negotiate anything, even a small symbolic clipping at the side of the rebate. We do pay more than France. But there is a logic in the French position, too, never reported in the British press. France has twice our landmass, with the same number of people. It has 28m hectares of agricultural land, compared to our 16m. Their farm subsidies - our rebate: both are unsurprisingly popular at home. But Britain and France are going to have to start compromising if they value the EU.\n\nThere is a chance for Britain to lead over the next six months, but only if we speak and behave as Europeans, not only as Britons. Tony Blair used to understand that. He used to say it. But he no longer sounds as if he is interested. It is easier to fight the rest of Europe over Britain's rebate than it is to fight the anti-Europeans back home. The danger is that sabre-rattling and point-scoring could lead to a complete breakdown in the European project this weekend. Tony Blair may say he's not a Eurosceptic. But he sounds like one to me.\n\njackie.ashley@theguardian.com", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "16/06/2005"}, "rank_144": {"title": "Budget delays put strain on new EU member states", "text": "Leaders in some of the EU's latest members, who joined last year as a way of shaking off the legacy of communism, are warning of severe consequences if no budget is agreed soon.\n\nVital projects to revive their economies will be put on hold unless Britain and France resolve their differences over EU funding, a series of ministers from eastern Europe told the Guardian yesterday.\n\nOne minister even warned that Euroscepticism, which began to wane in Poland after farm subsidies started to roll in, may return as critics seize on the budget failure.\n\n\"Discussions on the budget will have an impact on the support for membership [of the EU],\" warned a Polish economy minister, Krystyna Gurbiel. \"The principle of solidarity, which is one of the key principals in the union for us, seems in practice to be a bit questioned.\"\n\nA new budget is so important to the 10 new countries that they offered at the 11th hour of the budget row in Brussels last week to forego millions of pounds to save the talks. This failed, leaving them with two unpalatable options:\n\n\u00b7 Under the worst case scenario, if no budget is agreed by 2007, they will be forced to remain second-class EU members. If Britain and France fail to resolve their differences by then, the new members will be denied the \"full envelope\" of EU payments - which is around 300% more than the amount they receive now.\n\n\u00b7 Even if the budget is agreed before 2007 - and they have another nine months if they stick to the timetable of the last round in 1999 - the new entrants will suffer. Without a budget they cannot open negotiations with Brussels on how to spend billions of pounds in structural and cohesion funds to build motorways, and regenerate deprived areas.\n\nMrs Gurbiel said: \"It is a serious delay and it means that we shall have less time to implement the projects. We cannot start before the programmes are approved. I am afraid that if the decisions are not taken shortly, by 2007 we will not be able to continue support for enterprises very much needed in Poland.\"\n\nEtele Bar\u00e1th, Hungary's Europe minister, said: \"It is serious. It is not just a question of money. For us it is very important to know how much, for what goal, when and what way we can use the money. It is important we are well prepared for 2007-13. It is a bit of a shock. We have lost a lot of time.\"\n\nLeaders of the new EU members were furious with Britain for leading the campaign to reject the budget after Tony Blair demanded a cut in farm subsidies as the price for removing Britain's budget rebate. Marek Belka, the Polish prime minister, had Britain in mind when he criticised \"national egoism\", in remarks which indicated that countries historically well disposed to London may now be having second thoughts.\n\nThe ministers chose their language carefully yesterday but most made clear that Britain had behaved unreasonably, making it difficult to see how an agreement can be reached when it assumes the presidency of the EU on July 1. Ms Gurbiel said: \"Questioning [farm subsidies] makes this problem very difficult. For us the CAP is very important. Our farmers are getting much lower subsidies than the farmers in the older EU member states. So we cannot agree to a solution that will hit our farmers. That is a very difficult issue for Poland.\"\n\nMr Bar\u00e1th said: \"It will be difficult [to agree the budget during the British presidency]. Between France and Britain there is a big gulf over CAP. That is very, very difficult ... The surprise was that in the last minutes [of the negotiations] the British opinion was much harder.\"\n\nThere was strong support for Britain, however, from the Czech Republic. Cyril Svobod, the Czech foreign minister, said: \"In my view Tony Blair was right. Some of the reforms he suggested are highly welcome.\"\n\nBritain is acutely aware of the anger in the east and will be mounting a diplomatic offensive to restore relations. British ministers will point out that workers from the new member states are allowed free access to Britain, unlike France and Germany who restrict access.", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=World+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CPolitics", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "22/06/2005"}, "rank_208": {"title": "Leader: Politicians and judges", "text": "Last week Tony Blair hinted that he is prepared to confront the judges to get new anti-terrorism laws on to the statute book this autumn. Yesterday Michael Howard characteristically went further, warning that \"aggressive judicial activism\" is preventing parliament from doing its job of passing new laws to protect the public from the kind of threats that killed so many Londoners on July 7. Between them, the prime minister and the leader of the opposition are clearly signalling a confrontation with the judiciary over individual rights in the terrorist age. The issue is set to dominate the politics of the winter and beyond.\n\nAs July 7 showed, terrorism against innocent citizens is a modern reality. Politicians are not merely entitled to respond strongly; they also have an obligation to do so. But politicians should neither exaggerate nor seek to bully the courts out of doing their job. In our politico-media culture, politicians rarely suffer for talking tough. But the courts have a fixed and proper role to play in a democracy. And citizens should beware of politicians who threaten the judges in pursuit of other agendas - which in Mr Howard's case means his Euroscepticism-drenched hostility to the 1998 Human Rights Act.\n\nPoliticians are currently fond of mocking Lord Hoffman's comment in the Belmarsh judgment - in which the law lords overturned an important part of Britain's post 9/11 anti-terror laws - to the effect that it is those laws rather than terrorism itself that constitutes the greater threat to the nation. Mr Howard quoted Lord Hoffman again in his Daily Telegraph article yesterday. The intention, obviously enough, is to show that silly old out-of-touch judges do not live in the real world where people on tube trains get blown to smithereens merely because they live, in the words of one alleged Islamo-terrorist this week, in the \"vital organ of the minions of the devil\"\n\nAnyone who has actually read the Belmarsh judgment, as opposed merely to Lord Hoffman's part of it, will know that what the court said in December 2004 was much more measured and far more authoritative than this implies. In fact, though you would never know this from most of the political comment on the case, Lord Bingham's lead judgment (the one that spoke for the majority of the law lords) actually rejected Lord Hoffman's argument that there was no emergency after 9/11 sufficient to justify fresh laws. That was a matter for parliament and the government to decide, Lord Bingham insisted, and the courts should be \"unintrusive\", in line with European - yes, Mr Howard, European - precedent.\n\nHowever, Lord Bingham then went on, courts are specialists in the protection of liberty - and have been so since long before 1998. They are fully entitled to define the legal issues raised in statutes. \"The function of independent judges charged to interpret and apply the law is universally recognised as a cardinal feature of the modern democratic state, a cornerstone of the rule of law itself,\" said Lord Bingham. These are fine words, which could properly be carved in stone over the entrance of the new supreme court, when the building is ready.\n\nToo many politicians, the Daily Mail breathing down their necks, feel compelled to take cheap shots at the judges.

In this too often unedifying atmosphere of adversarial caricature, it remains for good politicians and good lawyers to hold the line, so that ministers, MPs and judges all play their proper roles in the defence of the strong and principled system of democratic government that Lord Bingham set out so authoritatively.

Conservative opinion was comfortable with Europe when its social model was seen as a useful bulwark against Soviet influence, but turned against it in the 1980s when the party fell for the \"voodoo economics\" of the American new right.\n\nLabour's journey has been more complicated. It rejected Brussels when the idea of national economic planning was still in vogue. When the dream of \"socialism in one country\" collapsed, Jaques Delors's vision of a social Europe was embraced as an appealing alternative to Thatcherism.\n\nNew Labour now appears to be reverting to a mild form of Euroscepticism, but this time its critique of Europe is of the right. The social market economy, once seen as a paradigm of modernity, is dismissed as an outdated failure, straining under the burden of unaffordable welfare entitlements and employment rights. A serious dose of liberal market reform is needed to enable it to compete with the more virile American business model. In other words, the rest of Europe needs to follow Britain.\n\nThis debate has come to the fore as a result of France's rejection of the European constitution, but not in the way \"no\" voters clearly expected. With characteristic lack of embarrassment, Tony Blair has seized on the unfolding crisis and the happy coincidence of Britain's EU presidency to push for more market liberalisation, despite the fact that this vision is precisely what the French people thought they were voting against. Next month, Blair convenes an informal summit of EU leaders to discuss the future of Europe's social model. By then he expects a rightwing government to have taken power in Germany and the balance of forces to have shifted decisively in his favour.\n\nHe is confident that Britain's recent past can be Europe's chosen future, and his favourite thinktank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, has even given his ambition a name: the Anglo-social model. This is said to combine market dynamism and social justice in a policy mix tailored to the demands of the 21st century. There is something to be said for this. The Blair era has been one of genuine progressive advance, as even his critics should admit. Unemployment has been reduced to the lowest level for 30 years, public services have been significantly improved, and pensioner and child poverty has been cut.\n\nEven so, it would be foolish to imagine that Britain can stake a claim to the leadership of Europe on this basis. These achievements are real, but they are only impressive by British standards. In his speech to the European parliament in June, Blair was at pains to stress the socially progressive elements of his platform. But highlighting New Labour's adoption of a minimum wage has limited impact in countries that have had one for years. And on investment in public services, poverty reduction and childcare provision, Britain remains a European laggard.\n\nTo the extent that there are features of the Anglo-social model to be admired, they are ones borrowed from Europe. The active labour market and welfare-to-work policies that have created high levels of employment were pioneered by the Swedes and the Dutch. The half a million new public sector jobs is little more than catch up. The expansion of childcare - one New Labour policy with genuine transformative potential - is Scandinavian in inspiration. New rights to paid leave and limits on working time are the result of European rather than domestic legislation.\n\nIf the best features of the Anglo-social model are familiar to the Europeans who invented them, there are others that make them recoil in horror. Britain remains one of the most socially divided countries in Europe, with levels of inequality closer to America than much of the continent. And although the gap between rich and poor has narrowed in the past couple of years, it has only just returned the levels inherited from the Conservatives. This is a record to be ashamed of.\n\nMuch of Britain's claim to economic superiority is built on sand. The secret of our success on jobs and growth has been the extraordinary accumulation of private debt and a consumer splurge that has boosted the service sector. A buy now, pay later economy is fine provided tomorrow never comes. Unfortunately, it always does. When that moment arrives and the low-paid service jobs dry up, Britain's relative weakness in exports, manufacturing and productivity compared with Europe will become painfully apparent. Indeed, there are already indications in falling unemployment, rising profitability and the best export performance in the world that the German economy is at last on the move. If so, it may not be too long before the eurozone is outperforming Britain.\n\nNone of this is to deny that there are problems with the European social model or that Britain can play a constructive role in helping to solve them. Germans consumers in particular need to spend more freely, albeit without accumulating British debt levels. Like Britain, the main continental economies need to devote more effort to creating new jobs than to protecting old ones. But they should also care about the quality of those jobs. It is still the case that it is often better to be unemployed in Germany than on minimum wage in Britain. This is not something New Labour should feel smug about.\n\nIf there is a model that provides the optimum mix of economic dynamism and social justice for Europe to succeed, it is not the Anglo-social or Rhineland ones. As Robert Taylor argues in a forthcoming pamphlet for Compass, it is to be found in Scandinavia - and Sweden in particular. In recent years, the Swedes have combined healthy growth, low unemployment, rising productivity and large export surpluses with some of the lowest levels of inequality in the world. Moreover, a strong welfare state and a framework of social bargaining that involves the trade unions are the mechanisms through which they have managed economic change successfully. According to neo-liberal orthodoxy, these are the very things that are supposed to be holding Europe back.\n\nTo be fair, those who coined the term Anglo-social model concede that it is a work in progress and that its success will depend on it continuing to move in a more Scandinavian direction. But New Labour ministers are rarely so modest. According to them, Britain is already an exemplar for Europe to follow. By being more humble in acknowledging its political debt to Europe, the government would not only be more likely to get a hearing in Brussels; it might also help to restore the idea that Europe is Britain's natural home.\n\n\u00b7 David Clark is a former Labour government adviser and a senior research fellow at the Federal Trust\n\ndkclark@aol.com", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "04/09/2005"}, "rank_284": {"title": "John Monks: Europe is all we've got", "text": "Has a large part of the British trade union movement lost faith in Europe? As TUC affiliates prepare for their annual congress in Brighton, a new mood of Euroscepticism seems to have seized some sections of the movement.\n\nIn the run-up to the failed constitutional referendums in France and the Netherlands earlier this year, some British trade unionists were claiming that the European constitution comprised \"an aggressive attack on working people\", and that the European commission is an \"overwhelmingly rightwing body\" committed to \"Thatcherism and militarisation\".\n\nThat is not true, and there is a danger of British trade unions working in their own worst interests if they once again paint the EU as the tool of unbridled capitalism.\n\nTrue, motions before next week's congress are couched in more moderate terms. One of them \"rejects\" the existing EU constitution and \"increasingly neo-liberal policies emanating from Brussels\". But other unions are more positive, putting pressure on the UK presidency to give stronger backing to the \"European social model\", and highlighting the crucial challenge of developing EU-wide trade union solidarity in response to the rapid trend towards cross-border businesses and services.\n\nThe European Trade Union Confederation works with the commission in drawing up social policy. That doesn't mean to say we always agree - and indeed the ETUC shares many of the concerns of British trade unions about existing legislative proposals. We are currently fighting with every means available - including the support of MEPs in the European parliament - to end the UK's opt-out from the already flexible working time directive. Equally unpopular was the Commission's botched draft Directive for liberalising services in the internal market. But the ETUC brought 75,000 trade unionists onto the streets of Brussels in March to declare their opposition, and since then the proposal has gone back to the drawing board.\n\nHowever, we supported the constitution - with reservations - as a necessary tool for strengthening social rights and moving Europe forward. The referendum outcomes, leaving the EU in a state of limbo, were misguidedly acclaimed by some as a victory for the left. Yet many sections of the British business community and media seized on the no votes to push forward their so-called \"reform\" agenda of deregulation, enfeebled worker protection and an EU reduced to the status of a free-trade zone.\n\nSince the abortive June summit and the launch of the UK presidency, Tony Blair has made EU reform his call to arms. But recent studies have shown that Europe's economic performance is by no means as far behind the US as some would have us believe, and that the UK's market-oriented reform model, based as it is on a buoyant property market, is not so sustainable after all.\n\nYet there is a real danger that the planned EU social model debate this autumn will strengthen calls for widespread deregulation and cuts in social spending, mimicking US policies. In response, the ETUC is set to launch its own campaign for a strong European social dimension that individual citizens can actually relate to.\n\nThe EU supports a model of social partnership - cooperation between employers and workers - that must be the way forward for modern economies. Legislation on workers' information and consultation, and the setting up of European works councils in cross-border firms, offer the main chance for employees to have a say in multinational company policies - crucial when it comes to restructuring. But the rules need to be stronger.\n\nIn the long term, Europe cannot resist the trends of globalisation, and the recent \"bra mountain\" furore has highlighted how fast traditional manufacturing industries like textiles are moving to China and other developing countries. But it can - and must - help its citizens to deal with them, through investment in training, lifelong learning and policies that really put into practice its commitment to better jobs in a high-skill, knowledge economy.\n\nIn these areas, single nations acting alone can have little influence. Economic muscle makes the difference, and when they speak with one voice, the 25 EU member states have the power to bring about change. At present, Europe is the only model on offer of a developed society that aims to couple growth with boosting the wellbeing of its citizens. But without the engagement of a vigilant but positive trade union movement pushing for the interests of working people, that model could be at risk.\n\n\u00b7 John Monks is general secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CTrade+unions%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "06/09/2005"}, "rank_173": {"title": "William Keegan: Europe needs to do some fiscal jerks", "text": "The late Hugo Young once told me he had a theory about Tony Blair. It was that our Labour Prime Minister was obsessed with money and the high life, and in an ideal world would in due course like to move on to become chairman of News International.\n\nThat would have been after fulfilling his ambition of establishing Britain's position 'at the very heart of Europe' by putting the pound into the eurozone. Young, the distinguished Guardian columnist, was passionately keen on the euro, as, for a time, was Blair. Older readers will recall that, although I myself have always been a strong believer in 'Europe', this belief did not stretch to joining the euro, a standpoint which upset Young and others.\n\nThis position was founded, and still is, not on euroscepticism (I love the way Ted Heath used to pronounce the word as 'euro-septics'), but on distrust of the pre-Keynesian rules according to which macro-economic policy is conducted in the eurozone.\n\nWe now know that Rupert Murdoch had the right of first refusal with regard to Blair's European policy. I happen to think that Murdoch's reservations about the euro were well based, but it is unlikely that his feelings about European economic policy are the first consideration in his anti-Europeanism. It was also outrageous if, as widely reported, in calling for a referendum on the Constitutional Treaty Blair was primarily influenced by Murdoch.\n\nBlair's move forced President Chirac into a corner and, instead of regarding the treaty as a necessary tidying-up exercise to streamline the functioning of an enlarged European Union, the French turned it into a vote about Chirac himself, unemployment, 'neo-liberalism' and other issues. One message from the voters was: 'There may be problems with the economy, but we don't want to jettison the European social model.'\n\nA similar message has emerged from the German election. There is economic discontent - not surprisingly with unemployment so high, especially in the east - but there is no great appetite for Angela Merkel's brand of higher taxes, greater cuts in social benefits than already envisaged, and a 'flat tax' that will exacerbate social tension.\n\nTo read most of the reactions to the German result, one would think the economy was on its uppers. Yet the truth is that it has proved remarkably resilient in the face of two severe shocks to the system, shocks in which politics has triumphed over economics.\n\nAt this stage we need a brief detour to the strategy Gordon Brown and his left-hand man, Ed Balls, devised towards the euro, in the face of huge pressure. Brown became Chancellor 24 years after Heath had taken Britain into the European Community. Apart from the political considerations, which were powerful, policy-makers at the time were also convinced that there were strong economic reasons for our joining a wider market and subjecting British industry to what it was hoped would be beneficial competitive pressures.\n\nSuch considerations also affected Margaret Thatcher's attitude when she signed the Single European Act of 1986.\n\nBut when it came to Brown's Chancellorship in 1997, the British economy seemed to have done reasonably well under Kenneth Clarke's stewardship, whereas Germany was wrestling with the economic difficulties of unification, and it was obvious that the rules of the macro-economic game in the prospective eurozone (formed in 1999) were far from attractive. Moreover, we must never forget the legacy of the searing experience of our ill-fated adventure in the exchange rate mechanism in 1990-92.\n\nNow, from its inception the 'common market' put politics above economics, but for a good reason - one of which I am sure Brown would have approved. Economic ties would bring France and Germany closer in a way that would make another war between them unthinkable. The strategy was a resounding success.\n\nBut the German economy's current problems stem from two subsequent episodes when politics once again triumphed over economics. The first was the manner in which unification took place after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 (Karl-Otto Poehl, the president of the Bundesbank, resigned over the one-for-one exchange rate between West and East Germany on which Chancellor Helmut Kohl insisted). West German officials discovered that, in the words of one, much of East Germany was 'an economic junk heap'. And then East German wage levels were allowed to rise much too fast towards western levels. The result was that the German economy, especially in the east, faced a huge competitiveness problem.\n\nThe next, and closely related, example of politics triumphing over economics was the way long-term plans for the formation of the eurozone were brought forward at the insistence of France's President Mitterrand and others, who feared the 'economic might' of a united Germany and wished for a European Germany rather than a German Europe.\n\nThis wish for a European Germany was shared by Kohl and the German establishment. I hasten to add that I'm not questioning the historical vision, merely noting the economic consequences. The consequences were the formation of the European Central Bank, and the strict fiscal rules of the Stability and Growth Pact.\n\nThe combination, as pointed out many times in this column, produced a restrictive macro-economic framework, which did not help a former West Germany that was now transferring some 4.5 per cent of its gross domestic product each year to the east - and still is.\n\nThere are several ironies. The strict economic framework was insisted upon by the Germans themselves, out of concern for the supposed laxity of the countries they christened 'the club Med' (Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece). The German economy was hoist by its own petard.\n\nDespite all this, the German economy is fundamentally in better shape than one is often given to believe. When the conventional view is that there has been precious little reform, German employers and the labour force have between them reduced unit costs and improved competitiveness dramatically. Germany is the world's leading exporter and, for all the moaning about 'outsourcing to China', business investment within Germany has been increasing for some time.\n\nThe traditional sequence of events during a German recovery was for higher exports to induce more investment and this in turn to encourage greater consumer spending. But the mood is bad and the economic problem in Germany is one of poor domestic demand and high savings.\n\nGermany has a vast balance of payments surplus. Inflation expectations are low. If the spirit of Lord Keynes were to descend on Berlin this weekend, he would say: 'Come on, get moving. Forget the conventional Bundesbank wisdom, which would consider raising interest rates because of fears of inflation even at a time like this. Expand demand, and deal with pensions, health costs and other demographic concerns when you have the economy back on its feet.'\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's director of research, Raghuram Rajan, said last week: 'Europe's citizens do not seem convinced that the bitter medicine of continued structural reforms will cure the stasis that afflicts much of the continent.'\n\nToo right they don't. They need lower interest rates and fiscal expansion (lower taxes, higher government spending) to get the European economy moving. Then they might be in better shape to face 'reforms'. Remember the horrors of the early Thatcher period, which made unemployment much worse before things got better.\n\nIf private savings are too high and restricting domestic demand, it is crazy for governments to add to the deflationary pressure with further cuts.\n\nNothing less is required than a complete rethink of economic policy at ministerial and central banking level in Europe. There must be a better way, and the French and German electorates sense this.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/William-Keegan,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acd3c8f38303a4eff3a5f907c9fe3d4d", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Business%2CEuropean+Union%2CEconomic+policy%2CPolitics", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "25/09/2005"}, "rank_92": {"title": "Say hello to Mr Camerair", "text": "Question: what's the difference between David Cameron and Tony Blair? Answer: 13 years. Every upbeat, feelgood word that Cameron utters, every media-savvy move that his spin doctors make, is testament to the way that Blair has transformed British politics - as much in his decade as Margaret Thatcher did in hers. And the content is quite similar too: New Blair with added Euroscepticism. Welcome to the age of Mr Camerair.\n\nTake that inspiring Conservative party conference speech with which David Cameron launched himself like a rocket from Cape Canaveral. I've spent a fair bit of time over the past few years reading Blair speeches. They have an unmistakeable look on the page:\n\nVery short sentences.\n\nLarge gaps between each line.\n\nI care passionately about this. We must do that.\n\nSelf-deprecating joke. Guy-on-the-street anecdote.\n\nList of past failures. Visions of future success! Sentences without verbs.\n\nNow I download Cameron's conference speech from his zippy website and, yes, it's a Blair. It has exactly the same look on the page, the same syntax of exhortation. Cameron speaks like a thoroughly modern private school headmaster, giving the boys a pep talk. Like Blair, he's not afraid of the word \"I\", nor of going over the top in missionary mode: \"I love my country. I love our character. I love our people, our history, our role in the world.\" He, too, can make the higher nonsense sound like sense: \"The Conservative party is the only party that wants everybody to be a somebody, a doer not a done-for.\" Hang on, so who exactly do Labour and the Lib Dems want to be a nobody? Never mind, it makes the audience feel good, a purpose he frankly confesses two sentences later: \"I want people to feel good about being a Conservative again.\"\n\nThen there's the characteristic Blair shock-list of statistics: \"When one-fifth of children leave primary school unable to write properly. When 1 million schoolchildren play truant each year.\" And so on. The verb-to-sentence ratio is slightly higher than in early Blair, but here again are the verbless wonders. \"To give choice to parents. Freedom to schools.\" This follows a passage about raising standards of literacy. (New Tories, new grammar: \"No, Belinda, a sentence does not need to have a subject, a verb and an object. A sentence needs a subject, an object and a spin.\") And his heart bleeds on his sleeve for Darfur and sub-Saharan Africa. At the end comes the rebranding: Modern Compassionate Conservatism, all with initial capitals. Or MCC for short.\n\nWhat's true of the style is also true of the content. His Policy Programme, Blairishly entitled Vision for Britain, contains this remarkable assertion: \"We must be a party committed to a vast programme of public service improvement.\" Vast. Is this Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal or William Beveridge's ambitious wartime plans for the welfare state? No, it's post-Blair public service hyperbole. And there's a touch of matricide too, as Cameron rejects one of Thatcher's most famous assertions. \"There is such a thing as society,\" he says, adding catchily but emptily, \"It's just not the same thing as the state.\" Well, d'oh! You don't say.\n\nThere are differences in emphasis, some of his emphases being more liberal than current government policy. For example, measures against terrorism \"must never undermine the very liberal values we're seeking to preserve. So, no ID cards, no religious hatred laws that impinge on free speech.\" Other parts are less liberal. But there is nothing here that Blair could not sign on to if he and Cameron were compelled to form a Grand Coalition, as their German counterparts just have. In the 1950s wits called it Butskellism, the centrist political consensus identified by the Economist with an imaginary Mr Butskell, combining the names of the Tory chancellor Rab Butler and Labour's Hugh Gaitskell. For today's crossbreed of Blair and Cameron, the New Statesman has got there before me, entitling a piece by the sharp-penned Nick Cohen \"The birth of Blameron\". I prefer my version, Camerair, since it also hints at the essential mixture of television cameras and hot air. It's so characteristic that Cameron's years of experience in the \"real world\" of business were actually in a media company, namely, Carlton Communications.\n\nCamerairism reflects a structural change more profound than Butskellism ever did. After the great ideological struggles of the 20th century, when communism and fascism were serious competitors to more or less liberal democracy, politics in most advanced industrial democracies is no longer about systemic alternatives. It's about variants of democratic capitalism. In Britain, in particular, it's more like a competition between two rival management teams, trying to convince shareholders that they are best suited to run UK plc. After NLNB (New Labour, New Britain), here's a bid from MCC.\n\nCamerairism also invites us to reflect on the resilience of the ruling classes. If Cameron gets the job, both major parties will - until Blair's promised departure - be run by upper middle-class public schoolboys, many of whose close advisers share similar privileged backgrounds. Only in France do you have a comparable phenomenon, based on many of the same elements: a very elitist top end of the educational ladder, a metropolitan political culture, and, above all, a system of individually but not collectively removable inequalities, which allows the governing class constantly to replenish itself with new blood.\n\nFor all that modern-man-of-the-people stuff, Cameron is an authentic toff: a product of Eton and Oxford, self-deprecatingly explaining that he only belongs to the exclusive, socially conservative White's club in St James's because his father, a retired stockbroker, was chairman of it. Even his youthful experimentation with cannabis or cocaine, if that is what his professed \"mistakes\" comprised, fits this picture. His spliff, if spliff it was, was a toff spliff. That's the spliff with added ambition, like the one I recall a future foreign leader passing to me at a student party at Exeter College, Oxford, while canvassing my vote in an effort to be elected president of the Oxford Union debating society.\n\nWatching the Blairites getting used to the trappings and privileges of power, the chauffeured limousines, the parties, the Derry Irvine wallpaper and themselves in time graciously assenting to become Lords and Ladies, I have often thought of Hilaire Belloc's lines:\n\nThe accursed power which stands on Privilege (And goes with Women, and Champagne, and Bridge)\n\nBroke - and Democracy resumed her reign: (Which goes with Bridge, and Women and Champagne).\n\nWith the Cameronites, you can be sure it will be the same only more so. \"The new comes back\", as an old east European saying has it. MCC stands for Modern Compassionate Conservatism. It's also the acronym of one of England's most tradition-conscious cricket clubs. Old and new are artfully combined. \"Things must change, so they remain the same,\" says Lampedusa's old Sicilian prince.\n\nOf course all my speculation may be void in a few weeks' time, should the Conservative rank-and-file prefer David Davis to David Cameron. But if they want a serious chance of returning to power, they'll go for Mr Camerair.\n\nIllustration: Matt Kenyon", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw="], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "28/10/2005"}, "rank_256": {"title": "Obituary: Sir Roy Denman", "text": "Sir Roy Denman, who has died aged 81, was one of the senior civil servants who negotiated the details of Britain's entry into the European Common Market in the early 1970s. He went on to work for the European commission in Brussels, and latterly in Washington as its ambassador to the US. His experiences made him an articulate champion of European integration and a trenchant critic of Euroscepticism, particularly as tepidly practised by successive British governments.\n\nUnusually for one who retired from the pinnacles of both British and EU bureaucracy, Denman did not just decline into agreeable retirement. Instead, he carried on the fight to make the British love Europe - or at least see where their national interest lay in becoming more enthusiastic about it. In pursuit of the case, he wrote two pugnacious but elegant books, regular letters to the press and articles for publications as diverse as the Guardian, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Herald Tribune.\n\nHe also maintained an apartment in Brussels (as well as one in central London) to which he and his wife would repair for at least one week a month to catch up on the news and gossip. Brussels-based journalists (of whom I was one) would receive regular summonses to lunch in his favourite restaurant, at his expense, for a leisurely exchange of views. It was usually a worthwhile, as well as convivial, experience. Genial, unstuffy and entirely lacking in snobbery or condescension, Denman was well worth listening to, not least when he accurately (and scornfully) predicted early on that, for all the Blair government's pro-European rhetoric, the prime minister lacked the nerve to make hard choices and become a leader in the EU.\n\nDenman was born in Liverpool, the son of a post office engineer and grandson of a docker. His father's career took the family to London, and the son was educated at Harrow grammar school. There he fell under the spell of an inspirational teacher of German, a language in which he became fluent and which formed the basis for a lifelong admiration of Germany and its people. He won a scholarship to read modern languages at St John's College, Cambridge, and completed a year of the course before being called up in 1942 to join the Royal Signals, which posted him to India. He served in the Burma campaign with the Gurkhas and ended the war as a major at the age of 21.\n\nBack at Cambridge he took a first and applied to the civil service. Turned down by the Foreign Office, allegedly because he did not have a public school background, he started in the Board of Trade, working his way up in a couple of years from the equivalent of a junior clerk's job to an assistant private secretary to the president, as the departmental minister was then known.\n\nIn his memoirs, The Mandarin's Tale (2002), Denman recalled an unexpected encounter with the ageing prime minister, Winston Churchill: \"He looked as though he had just woken up from a post-prandial sleep and did not seem in the best of tempers. Gazing at me with evident distaste, he inquired grumpily and loudly, 'Who's he?' The great man was then pretty deaf. 'THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE'S PRIVATE SECRETARY'. 'Huh,' said Churchill scornfully, 'Tell him to bugger off.' I did.\"\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Denman was posted to the British embassy in Bonn to promote trade interests; he found that the ambassador and most of the diplomatic staff could not speak the language and despised the erstwhile enemy. But it was here that he began to discover his true vocation as a diplomat and trade negotiator, skills honed as he moved on to become counsellor to the British delegation at trade negotiations in Geneva and then part of the high-ranking team working through the small print of the European treaty for several arduous years before British entry in 1973.\n\nHe returned to London to become the Cabinet Office coordinator for European affairs, but became increasingly disillusioned and frustrated during the Wilson government's laborious, and largely bogus, renegotiation of the treaty on which he had worked so hard. As his memoirs make clear, he viewed some ministers of the period with thinly veiled contempt, and when the opportunity arose in 1977 he moved to the commission as director-general for external affairs. It was a hugely unusual move for a Whitehall permanent secretary, especially at a time when the British government often sent second-raters to Brussels, a shortsightedness which only exacerbated British lack of influence.\n\nDenman spent the next five years travelling the world negotiating trade agreements for the EU, and finished his career in Reagan-era Washington (1982-89), convincing the administration of the efficacy of a more united continent.\n\nHe devoted a vigorous retirement to arguing the case for a fuller and more enthusiastic British engagement in Europe, especially in his book Missed Chances, Britain and Europe in the 20th Century (1996), whose title summarised his thesis. No one could accuse him of being a cloudy-headed romantic, or lacking experience in real-politik, but it was, nevertheless, a frustrating, aggravating and doubtless dispiriting experience for someone who had devoted his career to public service and the European ideal.\n\nDenman married Maya Lade in 1966. The couple had a son and a daughter.\n\nChristopher Roberts, UK director-general for trade policy (1987-97), writes: Roy Denman exercised considerable personal influence in two key areas of Bristish and European policy - Britain's relations with the EU and liberalisation of international trade. He played a central role in the various negotiations for Bristish membership of the European Community from the late 1950s onwards, but neither then, nor in his later jobs, was he an uncritical admirer of European institutions. As one of the first British directors-general to join the commission, he was able to temper some of its continental traditions with a more pragmatic British approach to public administration.\n\nThroughout his life he remained an eloquent advocate of European integration, and of the need for Britain to be fully committed to Europe. This was his view as a young man, when the cause was seen by many as progressive and forward-looking. It remained his view into old age, when he would restate firmly held opinions against opponents and fainthearts from any background.\n\nAt a time when the developed countries dominated international trade negotiations, Roy, with his tall and imposing figure and command of languages, was recognised as a key player, first in the British team in the Gatt Kennedy round negotiations of the mid-1960s, and 15 years later as the EU senior trade negotiator. In the former role certainly, and in the latter role as far as particular vested interests would allow, he contributed much to the freeing up of world trade, and thus to increasing global prosperity in the late 20th century.\n\nRoy was no respecter of persons. To his credit, the objects of his witty and sharp turns of phrase were usually his seniors, including ministers and commissioners. But after enjoying his sallies at the expense of others, you could also feel that the quarry of his next shaft of wit, once you were round the corner, might well be yourself. With his passing, the world will be a greyer place.\n\n\u00b7 Roy Denman, civil servant and diplomat, born June 12 1924; died April 4 2006", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "20/04/2006"}, "rank_161": {"title": "Blair's dangerous duvet days", "text": "As post-Blair politics takes shape, what new policy can Labour craft on Europe? The initial news last Friday morning that Downing Street was to appoint a secretary of state for Europe would have transformed British politics.\n\nFirst, it would have sent a clear signal to a leaderless Europe that Britain was prepared for a new role in the EU. Second, it would have obliged David Cameron to appoint a shadow cabinet member for Europe to deal with questions in the Commons - an appointment that would expose the enduring Euroscepticism deep in the Tory soul. And third, it would have finally forced Whitehall to take the EU seriously and move from defensive diplomacy to seeing Europe as the place where 21st-century Britain needs to be a commanding player.\n\nAlas, Whitehall traditionalism and prime ministerial caution rose up to snuff out this bold, reforming proposal before it ever became reality. It is not a question of personalities: despite starting life in the camp opposed the then European Community, Robin Cook and Jack Straw dealt with Europe in a calm, professional manner quite different from the hysterical hostilities unleashed in the 1990s by the Major administration, and Margaret Beckett will maintain the steady pro-European line put in place by Tony Blair after 1997.\n\nThis line has served Britain well and made London the favourite EU capital for new European nations as well as for many politicians from older EU member states, who come to Britain to see whether Labour has found the philosopher's stone of strong market economics combined with massive investment in social justice.\n\nMoreover, Ms Beckett has more international negotiating experience under her belt than most new foreign secretaries, from her days at the Department of Trade and Industry, where she tenaciously defended the Kyoto treaty against US efforts to sabotage it.\n\nBut her red box will be full of many real-time problems, of which Iran, Iraq and Hamas are the most obvious. Latin America is a continent undergoing seismic political movement, but no Labour foreign secretary has been there since 1997. Ditto Australia, where a reformed Labour party is sniffing at ousting the eternal John Howard.\n\nBritain lags behind other major powers in the very few trips its foreign policy chief makes to the new quintet of Asian powers: China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam and India. These cultures are based on personal contacts and relations, and if Britain is absent, it is noticed. So the new foreign secretary will have plenty to do. The kind of attention to Europe that was on offer when Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath made European affairs a full-time cabinet post will not be there.\n\nThis is a shame, as the politics of Europe, both at home and in the EU, are undergoing fundamental change. In Britain, the decision of a group of Conservative MPs to come out for full withdrawal from the EU shows how the isolationist politics shared by Ukip and the BNP are infecting the Conservative party. No less a conservative figure than the Republican senator John McCain, the possible replacement for George Bush, has publicly rebuked David Cameron for his snubbing of links with European rightwingers like Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy.\n\nFor most in Britain, the arcane politics of the European People's party, the umbrella grouping of the EU's conservative parties, is pure anorak territory; but in Europe's capitals, Cameron's fellow rightwing leaders are openly critical of the new Tory leader's extremist line on cooperation in Europe.\n\nFor Labour, it is time to make more public the deep blue water that divides the Tory politics of rejectionism on Europe from Labour and the Lib-Dems, who both see Europe in positive terms. The old rows over Europe in Britain are dying down; euro-entry is not on the agenda for the foreseeable future. When I made this observation as Europe minister 18 months ago, there was press agitation, but getting worked up about the euro is yesterday's story. Similarly, the constitution is dead. To be sure, Europe will need new arrangements by 2009 to take account of further enlargement, and parliaments can adopt and pass a simple intergovernmental agreement to have a standing chair of the European council. But the great constitutional moment, as shaped by Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing, is over.\n\nAt the same time, there are signs of a lift-off for the European economy, mainly based on countries like Spain, the east European nations, Ireland and parts of the German economy, which are putting in place the reforms the Blair-Brown administration has shown to have worked in Britain. Trade unions, under the subtle leadership of John Monks, the head of the European Trade Union Confederation, are seeking to write a new text for social Europe: the old Delors social Europe vision belonged to a Europe of the 1980s that was not exposed to globalisation, the end of communism, or the shift to low-wage production of goods and services far away from Europe.\n\nIn a thoughtful speech yesterday to the Labour Movement for Europe, Frances O'Grady, the TUC deputy general secretary, outlined some of the new parameters to ensure that EU developments include the interests of workers. If they do not, the old European white working class will turn to the nationalist, protectionist politics on offer from Jean-Marie Le Pen and his friends in the BNP, and other similar parties.\n\nIt is tempting to think Europe can go away and not be an issue in British politics, to pull the national duvet over our heads and think only of the US or the far east as the new international frontier for Britain; tempting, but wrong. Britain needs a coherent policy for the new Europe. If Labour does not shape one, then other forces, forces deeply hostile to Europe, will.\n\n\u00b7 Denis MacShane is Labour MP for Rotherham and was the longest serving minister for Europe in Tony Blair's government", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=World+news%2CTony+Blair%2CEuropean+Union%2CGordon+Brown%2CDavid+Cameron", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "10/05/2006"}, "rank_303": {"title": "Give EU more power to tackle climate change, says Balls", "text": "Gordon Brown's right hand man, Ed Balls, will say today that it is in the UK's national interest to collaborate more closely with the EU and that Brussels should have more powers to deal with issues such as climate change and the single market.\n\nThe economic secretary to the Treasury, whose views are likely to reflect those of the chancellor, will say that a stronger Europe is one of the four great areas where Britain needs to go further over the next 10 years.\n\n\"On the economy, the social dimension, the environment, enlargement and foreign policy, Europe is going to play a bigger role in the future,\" he told the Guardian yesterday.\n\n\"On these issues, it is in the British national interest to collaborate in a closer way in Europe in the future.\"\n\nMr Balls's intervention will be closely noted in European capitals anxious that Mr Brown's opposition to British membership of the euro and harmonised tax policies presages a deeper Euroscepticism if he takes over at No 10. Paris and Berlin are eager to understand the principles of a British foreign policy under Mr Brown, especially his attitude to the EU. Mr Balls was one of the most influential figures in the British decision not to join the euro.\n\nHis remarks, in a Fabian lecture, come as tensions over the government's European policies are growing in the Foreign Office. The foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, barred the pro-European Europe minister, Geoff Hoon, from answering Commons questions on Europe. He was told he could answer questions on northern Uganda, even though he reports directly to the prime minister on Europe.\n\nMr Balls will argue that the EU is vital to forming the stepping stone to a worldwide carbon trading scheme, and therefore the EU is a vital institution with which Britain must be positively engaged.\n\nHe told the Guardian he was quite prepared to see the EU given stronger powers to enforce an effective emissions trading scheme within the EU, including giving the commission new powers over allocating permits to pollute between nations. The current EU trading scheme has been hampered by individual countries being too generous in allocating permits to their industries.\n\nMr Balls, likely to be a key figure in setting the strategy for the next general election, also sees Europe and the environment as a central dividing line with the Tories. He said: \"A policy of positive European engagement with our European partners is a critical stepping stone to combating climate change. It is only by being fully engaged at the European level that we will be able to do that.\"\n\nHe argued that it is impossible to be an environmentalist without being an internationalist, arguing the Euroscepticism of the Tories precludes Mr Cameron's party from having any serious influence over the framing of effective international action to fight climate change.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CGreen+politics%2CWorld+news%2CEnvironment%2CClimate+change%2CEd+Balls", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "01/11/2006"}, "rank_166": {"title": "Cameron's Euroscepticism may damage Tories' green ambitions", "text": "A multi-coloured papier-mache bird will have - excuse the pun - a bird's eye view of a rare sight today.\n\nThe friendly fellow, who takes pride of place in Peter Mandelson's grand office, will witness the highlight of David Cameron's visit to Brussels when the Tory leader calls on Britain's European trade commissioner.\n\nBoth men, who have met before, admire each other greatly even though they are on either sides of the political divide, if only in a technical sense.\n\nMr Cameron believes that Mr Mandelson was instrumental in establishing New Labour by marking out political territory which the Tories are now trying to capture.\n\nThis is why Mr Cameron is happy to describe himself as the heir to Blair in deliberate contrast to Gordon Brown who has not managed to meet Mr Mandelson since he took charge of Europe's trade negotiations more than two years ago.\n\nFor his part, Mr Mandelson believes the Tory leader is a significant political force who is aping many of the tactics he himself used in saving the Labour party.\n\nBut when the two men sit down in Mr Mandelson's large office high in the European commission's Berlaymont headquarters they will eye each other warily, because they have diametrically opposing views on the matter in hand today: Britain's place in Europe.\n\nMr Mandelson is a passionate supporter of Britain's membership of the EU, which he believes is leaning Britain's way under a reforming European commission.\n\nMr Cameron is a staunch Eurosceptic who has never fully recovered from Black Wednesday in 1992 when, as Norman Lamont's special adviser, he watched Britain's humiliating exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.\n\nBut the Tory leader's views on Europe are becoming more moderate for two reasons.\n\nFirst, Mr Cameron was badly burnt by his botched attempt to take his party's MEPs out of the centre right EPP-ED group in the European parliament.\n\nSecond, some of his core political aims, such as dealing with climate change, can only be tackled with the help of the EU.\n\nMr Cameron will highlight this constructive approach today when he visits an \"eco-house\" in the EU's European district and pays a visit on Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission.\n\nMr Barroso is taking a keen interest in Mr Cameron, who may well be prime minister in 2009 when the commission's president's term of office will be up for renewal.\n\nBut Mr Barroso, who met Mr Cameron in London in October, will have a stern message for the Tory leader as he urges him to engage with Europe.\n\nMr Cameron will not roll over and express unquestioning admiration for Mr Barroso and the EU.\n\nBut he will not deliver a William Hague-style lecture on the need to repatriate powers back to Britain.\n\nHe will instead cast the Tories as the \"champions for real change in Europe\" as he warns that the EU is holding back progress in areas dear to his heart.\n\nThese are poverty in Africa - which he will say is being exacerbated by the EU's common agricultural policy - and climate change, where many EU countries are failing to live up to their Kyoto targets.\n\nWhile he will be critical of the EU, the mere presence of Mr Cameron at the headquarters of the European commission will mark him out from his immediate predecessors.\n\nSenior Tory sources say that Mr Cameron is not abandoning his strong Euroscepticism.\n\nBut he believes that if he is to present himself as a future prime minister he has no choice but to show that he will engage with the EU.\n\nThis explains why Mr Cameron has quietly dropped the Hague-era plans to renegotiate the common fisheries policy. Labour is watching Mr Cameron's evolution on Europe closely because ministers believe that some of his core policies - on climate change and confronting terrorism - will have no credibility unless he wins friends in Europe.\n\nCharles Clarke, the pro-European former home secretary, outlined this view when he told the Guardian: \"You can't be a green British prime minister without being pro-European. You can't be pro-security without being pro-European.\"\n\nMr Clarke claimed that unless Mr Cameron got his relationship with Europe \"into the right place\", he would not be able to contest Labour's \"central propositions\" on the subject.\n\n\"He probably understands that,\" Mr Clarke added, \"though quite how he does it given his own inclinations, God only knows.\n\n\"From his domestic political point of view he has got to get his relationship with Europe in the right place and it is in a very wrong place now.\"\n\nBut pro-Europeans in the Labour party know that they have to be careful about delivering lectures to the Tories on Europe because Tony Blair has struggled to live up to his commitment to place Britain at the heart of Europe.\n\nLabour, like Mr Cameron, also knows that Europe may take a new direction next year when France elects a new president and Gordon Brown becomes prime minister. Mr Clarke, who criticised Mr Blair's record on Europe in his Guardian interview in Brussels, said: \"You have a major change coming through which is the new French election, with both S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royale [the Socialist candidate] and Nicolas Sarkozy [the frontrunner for the centre-right nomination] offering a more modern, more optimistic chance of leadership of France from the sclerotic leadership of Jacques Chirac.\n\n\"You then have a German presidency [of the EU] starting in January which is trying to get the EU train back on the track and make it [keep] going.\n\n\"And then you have the change in our own leadership in the UK some time in the first half of next year.\n\n\"So you have all this change happening. What will it mean and where will it go?\"\n\nSpeaking at a conference on the future of Europe, Mr Clarke said he believed that the next generation of European leaders had to place security at the heart of the EU's work.\n\n\"Serious and organised crime, people trafficking, drug dealing, counter-terrorism, illegal migration: you can't sort [these] out in one country.\n\n\"You can only sort out in the EU as a whole.\n\n\"So for Britain ever-stronger defences of the white cliffs of Dover and ever-more splendid isolation won't be enough.\" Mr Cameron appears to be happy to look beyond Dover to meet such fundamental challenges.\n\nBut next year could be tricky for him because the Germans are due to draw up plans to revive the EU constitution, a process guaranteed to upset Eurosceptic Tories.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news%2CConservatives%2CUK+news%2CDavid+Cameron", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2006/12/07/mandelson2332.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f10b0a85389cff92ed2c7efae637183f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2006/12/07/mandelson2332.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f01670fc037ad18be75e7ebe8dbcfa80"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2006/12/07/mandelson2332.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f01670fc037ad18be75e7ebe8dbcfa80", "date": "07/12/2006"}, "rank_147": {"title": "Mick Fletcher on changes to LSC funding", "text": "It is unusual for the government to keep quiet about a good news story these days. So it's surprising that they are not shouting from the rooftops about the latest report on the tremendous benefits of European funding.\n\nThis money is being used to great effect. It is valued by the educational and training organisations that spend it. It is equally appreciated by those running the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) because it significantly helps them to meet their targets.\n\nSo why no headlines? Is this unusual reticence a late outbreak of Euroscepticism in the Department for Education and Skills?\n\nMore realistically, does the DfES fear that the imminent shrinking in European funds, an inevitable result of enlargement, will mean further cuts to the already damaged fabric of adult further education?\n\nOr could it be that praising the flexibility of European funding and stressing its achievements risks underlining how straitjacketed the funding for mainstream adult FE has now become?\n\nIn recent years the LSC, as a co-financing agency, has handled annually between \u00a3150m and \u00a3200m of European funding, mainly from the European Social Fund (ESF). Around a fifth of the money has contributed to programmes concerned with employer engagement. Just under a fifth has been focused on work with Neets (those not in education, employment or training) and a similar sum on adult basic skills.\n\nA report that I co-authored with Gordon Kirk for the Learning and Skills Development Agency shows that while ESF money is not used directly to deliver LSC targets, it has a substantial indirect effect. Success can be demonstrated in terms of qualifications gained as well as the participation of marginal groups.\n\nIt is more than just the sum of money that matters; \u00a3200m is not a large amount in terms of the LSC's \u00a36bn budget, though it is an increasingly large proportion of expenditure on adult learning.\n\nESF, however, appears to reach the parts that mainstream funding cannot. Time and again those Kirk and I spoke to referred to the benefit of ESF in terms of its being \"more flexible\" than mainstream funding. An important part of the report was to unpick what this greater flexibility meant.\n\nFirst, ESF funds are not tied so closely to learner numbers and volumes of qualifications. Local offices have been able to use ESF to fund the foundations on which subsequent, more target-focused work can build. Thus in many areas there was a significant investment in developing employer links, not constrained by the student number targets on which college funding rigidly depends.\n\nSecond, funding is not tied to the same short-term performance targets. So as the LSC sought to drive up performance on entry to employment (E2E) by focusing attention on the need to increase the numbers achieving in 22 weeks, and providers inevitably responded by dropping some of their more challenging clients, ESF stepped into the gap, helping to fund a raft of pre-E2E programmes.\n\nSometimes flexibility simply meant provision that is inevitably more expensive than average could be properly resourced. Among the examples that came up repeatedly was outreach work. ESF provision allowed adult basic skills work, and priority activity with Neet clients, to proceed.\n\nThe only negative element identified in the report is the limited impact that ESF-funded programmes are having on modifying mainstream provision.\n\nLocal staff across the country were concerned at the temporary nature of ESF funding and were anxious to protect the valuable work it had supported. Almost always, however, the response was to search for some other funding source, not to plan how the same benefits could be derived from the mainstream funding route.\n\nWe have to ask why, and whether we can't organise our mainstream funds to have some of the same flexibility that appears to underlie the success of ESF.\n\n\u00b7 Mick Fletcher is an education consultant", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Further+education%2CEducation"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "20/03/2007"}, "rank_120": {"title": "Our Germania", "text": "Fans of France's recently elected president, Nicolas Sarkozy, should pay more attention. What was the first thing he did after being given the nuclear codes? Why, he flew off to Berlin to kiss hands with Angela Merkel, who is Chancellor of Germany - and also supreme ruler of France. When will people grasp what the European Union is all about?\n\nSo wrote Peter Hitchens in a recent Mail on Sunday column. I am not going to berate Hitchens ... well, not much. Compared to his bloat brother, Chris, Peter isn't so bad. He has been magnificent on the Iraq war and the people who made it; he simply lacks a sense of proportion and has this need to turn a tut into a scream.\n\nHis text is mostly interesting as a major, if unstated, aspect of the Eurosceptic mentality. Talk to these folk conversationally, or in debate, and they will say things about bureaucracy (as if we didn't have a perfectly splendid one of our own) and about decisions taken over our heads (as if our dear government didn't devote its talents to doing little else). It also works up a lather over aspirational small print in the Treaty of Rome concerning federal powers never likely to be achieved, and hardly the coming of the Great Beast if they were. The real motives are different.\n\nPutting side the altogether rational Rupert Murdoch, who has been guarding his vast percentage of print and visual media from the possibility that, one day, there might be a European law sticking him at under a fifth, the chief motive of the Euro-haters is a delicious, luxuriated-in and entirely irrational fear of Germany.\n\nWe have always had large pockets this delusional thing. As a precocious schoolboy, I read a piece in the Sunday Express marking the formal ending of British occupational troops in, I think, 1955, with an assurance that Germany's statehood was not real. It was tolerated to function under the eagle eye of the British Army of the Rhine. This force, whatever might be said about change, was still the British army of occupation. Hugh Dalton, Attlee's first Chancellor, reacted to the Schuman Coal and Steel Community, precursor of the EEC/EU, by invoking Germany and asking God to forbid \"that that black ship should ever put to sea again\".\n\nTen years after the second world war, these might have been understandable anxieties however mistaken. AJP Taylor, 20 years on, during the 1975 referendum, arguing that Germany was making her bid for power behind the mask of \"Europe\", was, at that time, a crazy flight full into the teeth of 10-feet high reality. Said in 2007, such trembling horrors put us in barmpot country.\n\nObserve Hitchens' perversion of evidence. No doubt M Sarkozy did get the nuclear codes; he also went jogging, exchanged insincere felicitations with Jacques Chirac and walked through a ceremonial guard of soldiers. Why pick on the nuclear codes as point of reference? Is it suggested that the new president was going to hand them on to Frau-Kanzler Merkel, or that it would matter if he did, Germany having no nuclear weapons? We are into smears and the hysteria that incites smears. All that done, the water flooded with mud, we come to the final perfect rubbish. This lady, moderate conservative, the daughter of Protestant pastor, is \"the supreme ruler of France\".\n\nOh dear, as I said: barmpot, but universally refutable barmpot. Angela Merkel, by a small majority in an impeccably democratic election, held according to rules very much fairer and more representative of the voters than our frowsty lottery, is the head of government in the Federal Republic. She is also, over six months, president of that Sanhedrin of Satan, the European Commission. She was held up by medieval reactionaries in eastern Europe in her efforts at conciliation with Russia, but is winning wide respect despite this. She is the \"supreme ruler of France\" the way the Guardian's Mr Rusbridger secretly directs the Daily Telegraph.\n\nFrance and Germany made their peace and a fruitful alliance in Rheims in July 1962. How can any sane person think that lasting reconciliation between the heirs of 1870, 1914 and 1939, anything but a supreme act of statesmanship? I think it probably the best, most constructive and wisest thing done by any government in the last 100 years. If the British had shown sense toward that earlier Schuman plan, instead of brushing it off because \"the Durham miners will never wear it,\" we could have been part of the reconciliation and genuinely \"at the heart of Europe\". If so, we would have been among friends, something which so many British people, flying nearer the ground than Hitchens, still cannot bring themselves to believe or rejoice at.\n\nThe Germany and France so little disposed to war, so liberated from imperialist delusions (France, in that same year, 1962, finally out of the Algerian horror-show), have a thing or two to teach Britain. How can Hitchens who sees the war and death out of sight of an American enterprise condemned by France and Germany before it started, and joined in this by the great majority of European states, treat the German-French embrace as somehow malign and threatening? Germany is not responsible for the long catalogue of \"security\" restrictions, surveillance and dereliction of constitutional law under John \"Crackdown\" Reid. We reap there the consequences of too long, too servile, adherence to the United States, the gilded spar of a \"special relationship\" and the actual subordination so perfectly compressed by Mr Bush as \"Yo, Blair \".\n\nI would not myself call that melancholy excuse for a president \"supreme ruler of Britain\", but it has looked like it recently. How very much better it would be if, instead, we could recognise modern Germany, impeccably liberal-democratic, a vastly fairer society than ours, enjoying wholly superior public services and a country chronically averse to war, meddling and international aggrandisement, as the best friend we could have and, frankly, something of a model.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2010/12/31/1293792341589/Peter-Hitchens-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7bcde9012c3fc83f38bef8316a9f24bc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2010/12/31/1293792341589/Peter-Hitchens-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f70b618e77f4eed656e831af2c9640a4", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Peter+Hitchens%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CGermany%2CFrance%2CGeorge+Bush%2CTony+Blair%2CEuropean+Union%2CBooks%2CEurope", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2010/12/31/1293792341589/Peter-Hitchens-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7bcde9012c3fc83f38bef8316a9f24bc", "date": "05/06/2007"}, "rank_220": {"title": "Bush's euroscepticism", "text": "It is striking how the media coverage of the G8 deal on climate change has differed in Britain and the US as the text of last week's joint statement has been chewed over on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nMuch of the British press echoed the Downing Street line that the statement was a breakthrough. The reaction in the US, after reporters were briefed by the White House, was far more sceptical, emphasising what was not agreed in Heiligendamm. In particular, the American coverage underlined President Bush's refusal to endorse a specific goal for reducing global emissions.\n\nA commentary in the conservative Wall Street Journal went as far as to hail the final communique as a victory for the US approach to climate change - voluntary targets and economic incentives for technological innovation - over the European prescription of mandatory caps and carbon trading. The column was triumphantly titled: \"Bush 1, Greens 0\".\n\nThe actual text of the statement is deliberately hard to interpret, but it makes it clear that those two very different approaches to global warming remain unreconciled. The pledge to \"consider seriously\" the goal of halving global emissions by 2050 sounds vaguely encouraging but does not commit anyone to anything.\n\nDowning Street made much of the statement's reference to the leading role of the UNFCCC (the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) suggesting US acquiescence to that framework. But when the UNFCCC was mentioned in the joint statement following the Gleneagles agreement in 2005, it also included a group \"commitment\" to UNFCCC. In the eyes of the Bush administration's lawyers, it reflected little more than a requirement to pass on emissions figures to the UN.\n\nBush, meanwhile, won endorsement for his proposal to host its own meeting of 15 of the biggest polluters ahead of the next UN climate conference in Bali at the end of this year. That meeting is likely to see another US attempt to rally support for an American-led approach to climate change, which emphasises voluntary targets and technological evolution.\n\nIn effect, it clears the way for twin-track negotiations - one based on a US agenda, the other on a European agenda.\n\nWhat is new in the Heiligendamm statement is an end date for the negotiations of 2009. It does nothing to make that deadline any more realistic, but it does leave up to a year for Bush's successor to put his or her own stamp on any final deal.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Julian-Borger,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3f61b78eab309dd315e59533afd01fa", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=George+Bush%2CClimate+change%2CG8%2CUnited+Nations%2CWall+Street+Journal%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CUS+press+and+publishing%2CUS+politics"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "11/06/2007"}, "rank_278": {"title": "Eurosceptics are swimming against the tide", "text": "Last night, 250 self-styled young trendies gathered at an exclusive central London nightclub to mark the launch of the \"I want a referendum\" campaign. Their mission is to persuade the British government to hold a referendum on the EU reform treaty. Some of the attendees would be more accustomed to sipping champagne at a \"high society\" bash.\n\nThe organisers of the event would want you to believe Euroscepticism is the trendy issue of the moment - that their suspicion of Europe is hitting the zeitgeist, and that the young of Britain are in a state of anger and outrage about the UK's relationship with the EU.\n\nThe gathering at the swanky London nightclub may reinforce the position of those who want the UK to have a distant relationship with the EU. But it swims against the tide of the close business, cultural and educational linkages between the UK and the rest of Europe.\n\nThe combined result of the EU's free movement and low-cost airlines has been an explosion in the number of visits made by British people to the continent. Last year, British nationals made 53 million visits to the rest of Europe. Whether these are by groups of young men going to Prague for a stag weekend, football fans travelling to Barcelona or couples seeking romance in Paris, visits to the continent have become an established component of contemporary British life.\n\nSince EU rules guarantee the right of people to live in another member state, thousands of British people seeking a warmer climate and a new life have moved to live on the continent. The renowned British contingent in Spain, which dominates many towns on the Costa del Sol, now numbers 750,000, while there are 300,000 British people living in France. Many people own holiday homes in these countries, too.\n\nPeople from the UK are seeking business and professional opportunities on the continent, with 750,000 British companies now doing business with the rest of Europe. The European single market is now the largest market in the world. It provides a fountain of opportunity for British entrepreneurs, with a reach now to almost 500 million consumers, many more than the US market has.\n\nAs students, many young Britons spend a term or even a year improving their language skills and experiencing a new culture. (More than 7,000 students from this country take part every year in Erasmus, the European Commission's educational programme for higher education). Furthermore, the importance of sporting and cultural linkages such as Eurovision, European football and French/ Italian food should not be underestimated.\n\nSo the links are growing stronger at a time when some wish for us to retreat from the EU. But what do all these closer tiers with Europe have to do with the reform treaty and a referendum? Well, while some of those calling for a referendum wish to have a genuine debate about Europe, others wish to scupper, undermine and at times dismantle the UK's relationship with the EU.\n\nAs the former chancellor Ken Clarke said, many of the sceptics would call for a referendum if even a comma were added to the constitutional treaty. These visceral sceptics see a referendum on the EU treaty as a way of saying a firm no not only to the proposals in a treaty but also to the EU as a whole. They want the benefits of involvement with the EU but are reluctant to enshrine these.\n\nMany of the sceptics demand a referendum because they say the treaty entails a significant transfer of power from the UK to the EU. They point to an increase in majority voting in a number of areas. But the loss of the British veto also means the loss of the veto for 26 other member states. It means the UK is more likely to be able to force through beneficial legislation on issues such as energy liberalisation and the distribution of EU aid.\n\nOne of the most powerful advocates of the realpolitik of majority voting was Mrs Thatcher, who transferred several policy areas to majority voting in the Single European Act of 1986. She later wrote in her memoirs: \"British businesses would be among those most likely to benefit from an opening-up of other countries' markets [.] The price which we would have to pay to achieve a Single Market with all its economic benefits, though, was more majority voting in the Community.\"\n\nPerhaps some of the 250 youngsters attending the party, many of whom were born during Mrs Thatcher's prime ministership, would do well to read the relevant passages in her memoirs more closely.", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news%2CConservatives%2CMedia%2CRoland+Rudd"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "07/09/2007"}, "rank_230": {"title": "Not EU again", "text": "It's EU summit time again: the quarterly event that in some states inspires the occasional worthwhile debate about the future or meaning of the union, or the validity of a specific proposal from an interesting perspective, or maybe a media piece about an EU commissioner or institution. In the UK, on the other hand - or is it just England? - it is an event that unleashes yet another round of Euroscepticism, as EU-bashing is euphemistically known. Or rather it merely gives licence to an avid increase in the residual Euroscepticism - which is boring and repetitive, at best, and often downright misinformed. Worse still, it is slowly making the UK and its predictable lines less and less influential in the union.\n\nThe EU is a great success - whether as a security policy among its member states, in that it has prevented wars for 60 years, and still does; whether as a novel historical creation, an experiment in pooled sovereignty for the greater good; or whether as a massive trading bloc that has increased the overall wealth and quality of life of its citizens. It undoubtedly has many faults, in everything from policies to institutions, but the historical perspective suggests these are less than its overall achievements - yet these are rarely, if ever, mentioned in England. Instead, a predictable charge sheet against the EU is produced and decried ever more shrilly.\n\nThe main points on that sheet may be summarised thus: \u2022 we joined the common market, not a political union, and it's still the market we want and no more; \u2022 however, there is now a continental plot to create a European superstate; \u2022 the Eurocrats who make up the massive bureaucracy in Brussels have too much say over our lives since they decide everything; \u2022 we just give tons of money to the EU and get little in return.\n\nNonsense is the polite way of responding to this litany. Nonsense, because it is misinformed; and nonsense because the cumulative effect of this list is that it bars England from contributing to the European debate, for its own benefit and the benefit of others, at a meaningful level.\n\nThe misinformation stems from a basic truth, systematically hidden by governments over the years: all policy decisions, on every issue, from budgets to areas of red tape to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), are decided by the member states, not the hated and amorphous Brussels and its bureaucracy - which for the budget and tasks it handles, all decided by the member states, is actually quite small. It is the British government that has not only committed the state to every step in the EU, but has often actually led integrative policy - and that includes Conservative governments and especially Saint Margaret. While best known in the Isles for demanding her rebate money back from the EU, she was also the one who signed up to a whole string of integrative measures, including the Common European Act; and gave her blessing to a variety of initiatives that were forerunners of the vilified treaty being discussed at today's summit. She just never bothered telling her electorate about it.\n\nThe reality, as Baroness Thatcher and all her successors realised, is that time and events move on, regardless of sentiment. The UK may have joined the common market, but that was in the early 1970s. The world and the EU have evolved out of necessity, and constantly demanding it stays still as the UK wants it is simply unrealistic and narrow - if not downright simplistic. Because what the charge sheet actually boils down to is not a reasoned argument, but this: all in all, we are England and we don't want that national quality to be diluted in any way, or have a group of foreigners we helped save 60 years ago, tell us what to do. Ever.\n\nThis is the EU as a zero-sum game: everything one member state loses is a gain to another or others, and vice versa. In this reading, the \"pooling of sovereignty\" towards \"an ever-closer union\" which is what the UK actually signed up to upon joining the union, since both terms are in the founding treaty, is constantly and narrowly interpreted as a continental grab of English independence. That is the Sun and the Daily Telegraph reading of English identity, which for some reason the rest of the nation seems comfortable with. It is about Huns and ungrateful perfidious French and silly Italians and smelly Spaniards grabbing the English rose. It is so intellectually bereft, not to mention downright offensive, that it should not be worth talking about - yet it is the residual image, and many in the union are beginning to tire of it. If nothing else, it's repetitive and boring.\n\nInstead of this drivel, it is about time the English engaged themselves, and the EU, in proper debate about the future of the union and the place of England in it: a debate about the realistic capabilities of the one with and without the other, a debate that poses real alternatives instead of post-dated demands. The current debate is set to the level of the Sun and Daily Mail journalists - a species, by the way, never known to actually set foot in Brussels - and is no better than a slanging match about the past and a zero-sum game in the present. Worse still, it is so childishly offensive, that England is losing it.", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CThe+Sun%2CDaily+Telegraph%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "18/10/2007"}, "rank_264": {"title": "Thomas Kielinger: The bulldog voice of Britain", "text": "More pit bull than lapdog: that's how I would describe the combative DNA of the British media. There's often a touch of class to the jousting, for sure, but equally often the fighting descends into a slugfest with no holds barred. That's how the world has come to see, and mostly enjoy, the British print media in particular: hooked on personal drama, raw and adversarial, given to the robust exchange customary in an open society and an old democracy, at that.\n\nNowhere is this more true than in the great fight over the new Lisbon treaty. Europe seems to trigger some of the most visceral reactions in the British psyche. If you are a eurosceptic - which is how about 70 per cent of the British people would describe themselves - you only need turn to history to find all the relevant buzzwords to get worked up about Europe and the bureaucrats in Brussels.\n\n'The Last Supper' screamed the Sun on Friday in its inner pages, in its typically punning fashion - which, happily, is never very far from even the most bitter argument. 'Brown surrenders Britain's power to Europe over dinner', read the subhead. It must have sent shudders down the spine of true blue patriots to think that Churchill's 'We shall never surrender' should have been betrayed among the fudge majeure of some Brussels horse trading.\n\nHow is it that the eurosceptic media have such a field day within British society? I don't want to get into the unique geographic circumscription of an island nation that has always kept the continent at arm's length while at the same time embedding itself deeply all over the globe.\n\nMy take is both more practical and topical: I suspect the powers that be over the past 20 years have been covertly eurosceptic, belying all assertions to the contrary, like wanting to be 'at the heart of Europe'.\n\nGordon Brown is a case in point. Ten years ago he laid down the law on the five tests that would have to be met before the pound could ever be considered ready to join the euro - in essence saying 'never'. Since then he has acted as the wary partner of Europe, behaving like a schoolmistress telling unruly children to learn their economic algebra or forever be hoist on the Lisbon-agenda petard of the spring of 2000.\n\nBrown talked of 'red lines' in the way Margaret Thatcher kept banging on about 'wanting my money back' in her time. And back she did get the British rebate, just like her successor-but-three got his red lines written into the new treaty. Unlike Thatcher, however, scant benefit may be derived from it to restore Brown's tarnished reputation.\n\nWith successive governments professing to protect 'British interests' against an ever-encroaching EU, how can one expect the British public, and the media in its wake, to be anything other than overwhelmingly eurosceptic? A rational argument about 'Why Europe?' has never been considered necessary, nor has the EU done enough to enhance its credibility as an enterprise living up to its stated reforms. Into this vacuum the media has rushed with a vengeance - which is what you get when politicians cede the battleground.\n\nLike a reluctant follower of fashion, I, too, began to think of the debate in terms of the 'xenophobic Murdoch press' et al versus some more enlightened minority views elsewhere in the British media. Lately, I have been completely disabused of this rather shallow approach. For one thing, concern about an increasingly regulatory Brussels bureaucracy has little to do with xenophobia but is rooted, instead, in a deep aversion towards overweening, nannying systems trying to lord it over all of us. This sentiment is widely shared across the continent. For another, I was fascinated by the website response to an article by Michael White in the Guardian of 18 October, in which he broadly outlined a positive approach to the EU, pouring mildly phrased scorn on the 'no surrender' diehards.\n\nSurely, many people would have nodded approval of this line? Well, surprise, surprise: the response, over 16 pages, was mainly critical. Obviously, euroscepticism runs high even among Guardianistas, dooming all attempts to neatly separate advocates from adversaries, europhiles from eurosceptics.\n\nTrue, there were some jarring notes - like the 'peace in our time' jibe Michael Connarty, chairman of the Commons European scrutiny committee, threw at Foreign Secretary David Miliband during the latter's grilling by the committee this week. Brown the new Neville Chamberlain, selling out to the Brussels dictatorship? Give me a break. But then, hasn't 'European scrutiny' always entailed digging up false analogies? Every country is heir to its past, for better or worse.\n\nIdeally, Europe should modernise to the degree where neither red lines nor red herrings are warranted any longer. Fat chance.\n\n\u00b7 Thomas Kielinger reports from the UK for the German national daily Die Welt", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Business%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CMedia"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "20/10/2007"}, "rank_257": {"title": "Will Hutton: Tongue-tied Britain is losing its voice", "text": "In her short speech feting the architectural marvel that is the new St Pancras last week, the Queen commented that this is not just the remarkable rebirth of a great station, but it makes the whole country closer to Europe.\n\nThat, in the monarch's mind, is self-evidently a good thing. But it chimes awkwardly with an increasingly anti-foreigner, jingoistic, 'British jobs for British workers', Eurosceptic culture. Euroscepticism has morphed. It's questionable whether any coalition could be built to support the construction of the Channel Tunnel and high-speed rail link to Europe today. The Queen speaks for a passing generation and culture.\n\nIt is a tragedy and as a country we are diminished. Our geography, interests and so much of our humanity are intertwined with a continent of which we are part. The self-generated hostility to Europe and attendant cynicism leaches into the fabric of what we do, who we are and the choices we make. We will not like the consequences.At the same time as the Queen was getting ready to go to St Pancras, it was disclosed that fewer than half British schoolchildren now study a single European language for GCSE. Blame was laid with a 2004 government decision to stop making language study mandatory after 14. But the fall-away in European language studies long predates 2004; indeed, it was one of the reasons the government took the decision.\n\nLord Dearing, appointed last year by the government to investigate the drop, says one explanation is that learning languages is intellectually tough. But it has always been. What has changed is our culture. We no longer value speaking a European language, in part because we don't have to, but also, I believe, because we disdain Europe and Europeans. For what we are witnessing is not a gradual move; children are voting with their feet in incredible numbers because they feel nobody values speaking an European language.\n\nOnly 28.7 per cent of students now take French GCSE and a mere 11.5 per cent take German. It may be true that English has emerged as an international language, so that making the effort to study a European language has a lower practical pay-off, but that is disputable, as I will argue later. Again, the international use of English has not suddenly emerged over the last few years. There is another agency of change: virulent, toxic, culturally embedded Euroscepticism.\n\nIt is alive in the current debate over migration. It saturates the media. Newspapers such as the Sunday Express can wrongly claim that Britain is to be policed by a Euro-police or the News of the World that the Royal coat of arms will be taken off British passports, with no comeback (examples cited in the current edition of E!Sharp magazine).\n\nEven the BBC is affected; a recent report that made the tacit assumption that a silly spat over which city a treaty should be signed in was the best that could be expected from Europeans set my teeth on edge. It saturates our view of Europe's economic performance even when, as with today's Germany, it is doing very well. It has begun to be very unpleasant indeed.\n\nMy eldest daughter, who switched from studying German at university, partly changed because she wearied of having constantly to justify what she was doing. But the impact goes much wider than choices over language GCSEs. In the latest European Commission recruitment round, according to the Economist, just 2 per cent of applicants were British. The number of British graduates applying to be interns in the Commission, as preparation for a job, is running at 40 per cent of the level five years ago. The attraction of City salaries is part of the explanation, but, again, they have always been high. What is changing is our newly virulent Eurosceptic culture. Go to a party and tell your friends you want to work in Brussels and you will be derided and mocked.\n\nThis is horizon-shrinking, mean, joyless and self-defeating. If part of the excuse for our uninterest in speaking foreign languages is that English is now the world language, it should not follow that the languages others speak are of no use or cultural importance. Indeed, there is evidence that the internationalisation of English is changing structure and use so much that native English speakers are at a double disadvantage. Not only can they not make themselves understood in the language of others, they cannot navigate the complexities of the new Globish, an English mutating into something very different from the English we speak.\n\nIt also leads to a genuine battiness about our place in the world. Even as the Americans have learnt they need friends, we British have acquired unilateral instincts with a fraction of their economic and military power. Of Gordon Brown's recent catalogue of misjudgments, perhaps the most extraordinary was his commitment to create 'British jobs for British workers' - a BNP slogan. Our cultural sensibility is inured to the underlying ethnic apartheid that his words implied. Nobody in his inner circle thought to warn him and too few picked up on it at the time.\n\nBut I think the worst aspect of this disdain for Europe is its cramping inwardness. I am a governor of Hockerill School in Bishop's Stortford, a state comprehensive that the Times this year ranked as the number one school in the country - public or private. Fifteen years ago, it was an also-ran. But it is no accident that the school's new academic excellence and intellectual vitality are via its unparalleled commitment to language teaching (students generally take two language GCSEs) and its commitment to fill some of its boarding places with students from the EU.\n\nThe interaction of cultural diversity and the intellectual rigour involved in studying language - history is taught in French - has meant that ordinary kids from ordinary homes comfortably outperform pupils at expensive private schools such as Westminster and Winchester.\n\nIt is a precious achievement, but in today's climate, too few state schools will dare to follow or get cultural or community support if they try. The fast route to academic success is not raising the school leaving age as proposed last week; rather, it would be making two language GCSEs mandatory. The wider spill-over - on our imagination, on business, on culture - would be so beneficial. As it is, we are fast becoming a nation of dumbed-down nationalists snarling across the Channel. It's not, I think, what most of us want.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=British+identity+and+society%2CSchools%2CUK+news%2CEducation", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Will-Hutton,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4c2617582ee4414d8af883dbb8cff88a"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "11/11/2007"}, "rank_201": {"title": "Small change", "text": "Denmark has, like Britain, enjoyed a decade-long economic boom. We share membership of the European Union and, like the British, still have our own currency, the krone. At a referendum in 2000 the Danes said no to the euro. Some argue that positioning ourselves outside the eurozone has benefited our respective economies. This may to some extent be true of Britain, but the krone was always aligned with the German deutschmark and today we are pegged to the euro. So the potential benefits of maintaining the krone is mostly symbolic - and, to my mind, rather questionable.\n\nBeing a small nation, the Danes are with some justification wary of being swallowed by the big bad union. Although we have been in the EU since 1972, both Danish political wings have had Eurosceptic factions. Back in 1992, I - along with many other liberals - voted no to the Maastricht treaty. Many of us later on regretted our vote, because it put us in the same chauvinistic boat as European rightwingers such as Jean-Marie Le Pen and Jorg Heider. It is important to understand that Euroscepticism in Denmark is not just a rightwing phenomenon. However, over the last 10 years the rightwing Danish People's party, which once again formed the parliamentary foundation for a centre-right government, increasingly came to define patriotism and what being Danish means. Their smug version of Danishness is not a sentiment that all Danes subscribe to. However, in today's political landscape the Danish People's party remains a dominant player. Fear of everything unknown is widespread in Denmark today - hence our permanent and unjustified paranoia of being overrun by Muslim immigrants. Apart from the xenophobia, the most depressing part of the recent election was that the debate was dominated by money, taxes and the issue of personal rights. The Iraq war, where Danish troops are still fighting alongside the Americans and British, was hardly discussed during the electioneering. Nor were other international topics.\n\nIt seems as though we as a nation are cuddling up and hiding from a world that we perceive as a threat to our wealth and privileges. To me, holding on to the Danish krone has come to signify that we are avoiding full European cooperation. Danes are willing to benefit from being in the union, but want to constantly keep a foot in the door. National currencies are highly symbolic, but today the anti-euro lobby is the home of reactionary tendencies.

Quentin Davies has made effective attacks on Conservative Euroscepticism. Shaun Woodward presides over Northern Ireland from the cabinet.\n\nThe difference with Jones is that he was always clear he was not joining the Labour party, still less the Labour tribe. He took up the offer from Gordon Brown to go out and bat for Britain and British business worldwide - a West Midlands version of Prince Andrew, perhaps - as long as he did not need to sully himself with the world of party politics. This insistence on being a semi-detached and apolitical member of the government partly explained the discontent among trade unionists and Labour peers over his appointment, along with his vociferous opposition to the minimum wage before 1997.\n\nIn office, Jones has never been prepared to defend the full range of government policy, and broke with collective responsibility entirely over the taxation of non-doms. It would have made more sense to make him a trade envoy or part of an expert group than to appoint this kind of crossbench minister.\n\nSo news of Jones's future departure is not much of a surprise, though the timing of it will not please Downing Street at all. Jones may be irked that at least two of just 12 participants in a private discussion seem to have spilled the beans. A great many Westminster and Whitehall discussions take place on a private basis or under the Chatham House rule. Perhaps 99% of the time it is observed. But the only way to be sure that something won't get out is not to stay it. Never Jones's strong point.\n\nHowever, Jones's larger-than-life persona can also lead people to underestimate how his views have changed in recent years. He had moved a fair way from advocating the \"slash the state\" Thatcherite politics than many in the labour movement associate him with.\n\nHe has become evangelical about one of Gordon Brown's core political ideas - the need to improve skills and to unlock potential if Britain is to compete in the global economy. And his commitment to trade promotion abroad highlights the importance of government acting to attract inward investment: an issue which has tripped Boris Johnson up in the London mayoral election after his ill-judged plans to close down London's inward investment offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Delhi, Mumbai and Brussels came under fire from the City.\n\nFor some in small business, this shift in Jones's outlook will simply prove that the CBI and the big corporations never look out for the little guy. But it is indicative of a more interesting - and underrated - political shift. Despite 30 years of anti-government rhetoric, on issues from climate change to global financial instability, the call is always for government to act. The Tory modernisers believe they have become electable because they are running on Labour spending plans and eschewing tax cuts. Perhaps this will lead them to mirror Bill Clinton's move to the centre in acknowledging the end of big government: in their case they could announce that, in the age of climate change, \"the era of small government\" is over. (And what a shame Gordon Brown probably won't do so first).\n\nBut the Jones episode also demonstrates the pitfalls of \"big tent\" politics. Reaching across party boundaries can be good politics; and can offer a wider range of inputs to policy too.\n\nBut Gordon Brown's difficulty has been in giving his government a clear sense of political direction. A big tent cannot do that because definition cannot be achieved without saying things with which some people will disagree. Politics is also about picking the right fights. We don't know yet which one Gordon Brown will choose.\n\nTo stick to the tactics of triangulation is to fail to adapt to the fact that the Conservatives are now learning from three successive defeats. As the opposition ape progressive language and aspirations, this is to offer to fight a general election on David Cameron's terms. If voters believe there is little difference between the parties, the election is simply a referendum on the incumbents, not a choice between alternative governments.\n\nAnd that would be an election - with or without Jones on the campaign trail - that Gordon Brown would struggle to win.", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Gordon+Brown", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "15/04/2008"}, "rank_252": {"title": "Giles Merritt: End EU navel-gazing", "text": "The EU has no coherent strategy on many issues. It has only sketchy economic policies toward Russia; ambitions, but no game plan, to become a player in the Middle East; and, despite its original leadership on the Kyoto Protocol, no successor program on climate change. And the biggest question of all \u2013 how to engage with China, India, and other giants of the future \u2013 has received virtually no attention from EU-level policymakers.\n\nThese issues require attention now, and an integral part of the EU's search for new global strategies should be to invite, rather than avoid, criticism of its activities. If the EU is to lift its gaze from its navel to the horizon, it must reconcile the very different views that exist across Europe of its place in the world and its own best interests. That means engaging with those shades of political opinion that the European commission and the European parliament consider \"eurosceptic.\"\n\nThe counter-pressure, of course, is that EU officialdom feels unloved and unappreciated. There is an almost embattled culture among many senior officials, who fear that fanning the flames of dissent among Europe's voters could one day knock European unity off course.\n\nEuroscepticism represents everything the Eurocrats dislike. They worry that politicians and journalists who oppose their strategies for closer political and economic union could yet tip the balance of public opinion against the EU. Eurosceptic politicians elected to the European parliament are often treated with the disdain that true believers reserve for the infidel.\n\nYet it is ludicrous to think that eurosceptics represent a silent majority that could rise up and destroy the EU. Popular support for the European project has barely faltered over the last 25 years, and has even begun to strengthen of late.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, when Europe was faltering and the media catchword was \"eurosclerosis,\" 50% of people polled for the Eurobarometer surveys viewed membership as positive for their country. About 19% said its effects were negative, and the rest didn't know. Today, overall support for the EU stands at 57%, and the share of people unhappy with it has dropped to 15%.\n\nThere are now no EU countries where eurosceptics are in the majority, and the widespread impression that citizens in Western and Eastern Europe alike are turning their backs on the EU is wrong. The reality is that even though voters may find the EU remote, most appreciate the need for Europe to unite in a world where China, India, and other fast-developing countries are set to challenge it.\n\nReassured by this groundswell of support, the Eurocrats should be fostering a much more pluralistic approach to EU policymaking and debate. The commission should be organizing public debates that give equal prominence to dissenting views. Eurocrats must learn that euroscepticism is fundamentally healthy, because it invites closer examination of the policy options open to Europe, and thus increases the involvement of ordinary people in the EU's policymaking process. And greater involvement quickly leads to better understanding of the issues at stake, and the reasons why some policies have been adopted that challenge or even override the sovereign powers of individual countries.\n\nFor half a century, Europe's integrationists have sought unquestioning acceptance of their efforts. That demand must be abandoned. It will probably take several generations before a workable EU-wide political system emerges, but the first step is for the EU to encourage people to have their say, however uncomfortable that may be.", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "12/07/2008"}, "rank_185": {"title": "Charles Kennedy warns Lib Dems against pandering to Euroscepticism", "text": "The former leader of the Liberal Democrats, Charles Kennedy, has warned his successor of \"pandering\" to Euroscepticism after signs that the EU might be slipping down the party's agenda.\n\nSpeaking in a debate on Europe on the penultimate day of the party's Bournemouth conference, Kennedy \u2013 now president of the European Movement \u2013 said Europe was a \"litmus test issue\" for the party, and raised doubts about the wisdom of the Lib Dems' strategy when the House of Commons voted on the Lisbon treaty in March.\n\nThen three frontbenchers resigned after defying party orders to abstain in the vote on calls for a referendum on the treaty. Alistair Carmichael, Tim Farron and David Heath resigned their posts so they could vote in favour.\n\nYesterday Kennedy said: \"We will not - and I think to an extent perhaps we learnt this lesson in the division lobbies of the House of Commons earlier this year - benefit, far less profit politically, by pandering to any extent to Euroscepticism.\"\n\n\"This party is at its best when we have taken principled stands on foreign affairs. Ashdown on the plight of the Hong Kong Chinese and during my own time on Iraq.

Nick Clegg gave an interview at the weekend suggesting the euro was no longer \"an urgent priority\".\n\nSumming up at the end of the debate, Edward Davey MP spoke in favour of the UK joining the single currency, but conceded that winning a referendum on the euro would not be possible at present.\n\nHe said: \"We recognise that we couldn't join the euro overnight, that we would need to win a referendum first, and that in a practical world that is some time off.\n\n\"But as time goes on - as the pound goes through the floor, as the cost of staying out grows - we will not be the only ones arguing the case for the single currency.\"\n\nThe main point of yesterday's debate was to ask the party to back reform of the EU's farming and fisheries policies as well as more accountable budgets. Their policy paper - Shaping our World through a Stronger Europe - calls for the UK to be at the centre of the EU, driving closer cooperation on climate change, justice, security and defence.\n\nOpening the debate, Sir Colin Budd said Gordon Brown's heart was \"clearly not in it\" on Europe and that under a Tory government there was a \"clear and strong risk\" that the UK would be moved to the fringes of the EU.\n\nJonathan Fryer, chairman of the Liberal International British group, said the party was being too soft on Labour and the Tories by describing their approach to Europe as \"half-hearted\". He said: \"Sometimes I think this party is too polite. A 'half-hearted approach to Europe'?

This time it's former Tory CEO Sir Paul Judge's turn to launch \"The Jury Team\": and begin the search for election candidates keen to be part of all that they despise. The idea is start small, think big; and with that in mind we should not be surprised that few of Sir Paul's old colleagues at Westminster seemed to know anything about yesterday's launch. Why, he didn't even tell his MP, Peter Luff, that he was setting up a new party. That's just rude: Judge is president of Luff's local Conservative Association in Worcester. So why is Sir Paul doing it? Conservatives are baffled, for, as we see, there is a healthy strain of Euroscepticism within their own party. There always seemed to be enough bile to go around.\n\n\u2022 Read the headlines. \"Home Office gave illegal instructions to immigration officials\" is one. \"MI5 criticised for role in case of torture, rendition and secrecy\" - there's another. Many lawyers in government, perhaps too many, but still, they need help with this legal stuff. Luckily help is coming. Staff, we learn, will benefit from a \"Home Office Masterclass: Joshua Rozenberg on law\" on the basis that the former BBC correspondent turned all-round legal pundit \"has had a ringside seat at the majority of the department's most significant cases\". \"What is the perception of the Home Office through legal eyes?\" will be a key topic. Hope he doesn't make them cry.\n\n\u2022 With Gordon setting out his stall on nuclear power today, what more do we know of Justine Thornton, the lawyer for power company E.ON who shares a home and a life with climate change secretary Ed Miliband? Could this Justine Thornton be the same person who manoeuvred herself to become co-ordinator of the energy group for Sera, Labour's environmental campaign? The one who at the Sera AGM in 2007 argued in favour of David Miliband becoming president, despite the fact he was rampantly pro-nuclear power, a policy diametrically opposite to Sera's policy against nuclear energy for the preceding 25 years? If she declared an interest at the time, no one remembers it; perhaps she didn't have to. But the tussle and its outcome certainly led to members tendering their resignations. No doubt it still raises a smile at home.\n\n\u2022 No surprise that a few weeks into the job, Sir Paul Stephenson, Britain's top cop, should seek to reshuffle the pack. Each new man has new ideas, different priorities. He's smart too. For by moving deputy assistant commissioner Stephen Roberts from a senior berth in HR to a backroom role, developing the apparently crucial relationship between Oxford University and the Met, the commissioner has enhanced the force's links with academia. Sir Ian Blair went to Oxford, remember. These things matter. Sir Paul has also enhanced his own ability to deal with criticism widely expected to form part of the race and faith inquiry commissioned by Boris Johnson. Roberts had become a lightning rod for complaints from black officers that they were failing to gain promotion. Now, when the day arrives, Sir Paul can say he was ahead of the curve. Crisis averted. Roll on the next one. That's the Yard. That's how it works.\n\n\u2022 And finally, we have travelled through days of horror and hope in Northern Ireland - with the return of murderous terrorism, but also a united response from the various politicians. Many things will result from this. Here is one of them. Last week George Weiss, aka the surrealist Rainbow George, contacted the Electoral Commission and formerly de-registered Make Politicians History, the four-year-old protest party under which banner he fought the 2007 assembly elections in Belfast. \"Having seen the way the politicians there have come together since the attacks, I have come to rather admire them,\" says Rainbow, strangely subdued. Make Politicians History is now history. Amid the japes, real life.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 18 March 2009.

Chris has long despaired of the Tory leadership's tactic of appeasing the rabid Euroscepticism of the party's rightwing, and long ago decided to retire from parliament in June because he had had enough.\n\nAs I have said before, Europhiles are an endangered species in the Tory party. Beazley has, predictably, been crucified by the likes of Conservative Home, the same forum where a party member was described as a \"traitor\" because he dared to point out a few benefits of the European Union. However, Christopher's insistence that he could not \"watch and say nothing while the Tories walk away from their allies, friends and colleagues in Europe\" \u2013 and his plaintive expression that \"I cannot watch my country head for the rocks, which it will do if Cameron becomes prime minister and has no allies in the major governments of the European Union\" \u2013 should strike a chord with many of the remaining Tory moderates.\n\nOver the last 20 years or so, Labour and the Conservatives have punched above their weight in the two largest political groups in the European Parliament and, since 1999, so have the Liberal Democrats. Now Britain will have no presence in one of them (except for those - and I know of at least one besides Beazley - who will not follow Cameron's silly instruction).\n\nSo, why do it?\n\nThe official reason for the Conservatives' decision to leave the European People's party-European Democrats grouping is that the EPP has some federalists in it. This is bizarre: the EPP has federalist members, but it also has many non-federalists (apart from the Conservatives, there are Ulster Unionists, Swedish Conservatives, French Gaullists, Czech Civic Democrats and various others). But anyway, so what? The European parliament doesn't decide on the level of EU integration. It is national governments and parliaments that decide on that \u2013 the European parliament only decides on the content of EU legislation in areas that the EU is already responsible for. On most of this, the Conservatives and other EPP parties normally agree.\n\nThe reality is that this position is nothing to do with whether the EPP is federalist or not \u2013 it is David Cameron giving a sop to the headbangers on the right of his party whose votes he needed when he was elected as leader. The issue doesn't really figure very much in public debate \u2013 Europe as an issue is well down the list of priorities for people \u2013 but it does matter to the \"blue rinse\" brigade. In other words, symbolism has prevailed over reality.\n\nBut in trying to keep the party faithful happy, Cameron still risks embarrassment in this enterprise. Even if the Tories do succeed in taking the governing Czech Civic Democrats (who are as riven as the Tories by domestic splits and have just lost a vote of no confidence) and the Polish Law and Justice party with them, they will still be searching for MEPs from at least four other countries to form a group. It is very difficult to see how they will be able to lure any of the moderate right parties. Another possible ally, the Italian post-fascist National Alliance (who have historically had close links to the Conservative Monday Club and to MPs such as Bill Cash and Andrew Rosindell), has now joined forces with Silvio Berlusconi and will join the EPP after June. This will leave the Tories making deals with random mavericks and independents - a recipe for further embarrassment.\n\nThe other question is whether other Tory MEPs will follow Beazley's lead in refusing to leave the EPP. Caroline Jackson (whose husband Robert Jackson MP defected to Labour just before the last general election over Tory policy on Europe) has already described withdrawal from the EPP as \"ridiculous\" and \"a serious mistake\", adding ominously that she is \"minded to leave the party\" as a result. Moreover, while other pro-European MEPs (such as John Purvis and John Bowis) are also standing down in June, the likes of James Elles, Malcolm Harbour, Edward McMillan Scott and Struan Stevenson are also on record as being staunchly opposed to leaving the EPP. Indeed, McMillan Scott has described alternatives to EPP-ED membership as \"frankly barking\", while Stevenson has stated his refusal to consider joining forces with \"fascists and nutters that nobody else will sit with\". These members, particularly McMillan Scott (who is a vice-president of parliament) and Harbour (who speaks for the EPP on the powerful Internal Market committee) will be concerned about losing these positions of influence.\n\nConservative pro-Europeans have been distinctly lily-livered since 1997. They have failed to stop Eurosceptics taking over their party, and, save perhaps for Ken Clarke, failed even to put up a fight about it. But there are now a handful of pro-European Tories who are retiring and have nothing to lose. Beazley may be the first of several pro-Europeans firing a couple of shots in the air to remind the party that, once upon a time, it was sane on Europe.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservatives%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "28/03/2009"}, "rank_239": {"title": "Czech parliament puts doubts aside to ratify Lisbon treaty", "text": "Europe's long and ill-starred attempt to streamline the way the EU is run surmounted one of its last major obstacles today when the Czech parliament ratified the Lisbon treaty.\n\nIn one of the last acts of a government brought down humiliatingly halfway through chairing the EU for the first time, the Czech upper house endorsed the treaty by a comfortable majority, despite a prevailing mood of acute euroscepticism.\n\nThe outgoing Czech prime minister, Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, said a failure to ratify the treaty would have been a huge embarrassment for the country, and would have dangerously split eastern from western Europe and spelt an end to further expansion of the EU.\n\nToday's vote means that Ireland is the remaining big problem for a treaty pushed by Germany and France and supported through gritted teeth by the Gordon Brown government while being fiercely opposed by David Cameron's Conservatives.\n\nIreland is the only country to have staged a popular vote on the treaty, rejecting it in a referendum last June.

I'm wary of psychobabble, and it might be nothing, but I suspect that Cameron's war film mania must tell us something significant about the imaginative landscape of the man likely to become our next prime minister.\n\nWhat do you think?", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2009/6/17/1245255188518/A-scene-from-Where-Eagles-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=136e2acb1d900ae6dbd7d1d0ad85e6bd", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CFilm%2CDavid+Cameron%2CWhere+Eagles+Dare", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2009/6/17/1245255188518/A-scene-from-Where-Eagles-001.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8c96cc74041635c3ef9957b54583f51a"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2009/6/17/1245255188518/A-scene-from-Where-Eagles-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=136e2acb1d900ae6dbd7d1d0ad85e6bd", "date": "17/06/2009"}, "rank_96": {"title": "EU president warns David Cameron to rethink his Euroscepticism", "text": "David Cameron will struggle to implement his plans as prime minister on a range of issues, including climate change, unless he changes his Eurosceptic attitude and learns to work with European leaders, the new president of the EU has declared.\n\nIn a sign of the unease among many EU leaders at the Tory leader's decision to establish a new Eurosceptic group in the European parliament, the Swedish prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, told the Guardian Cameron will \"need\" mainstream leaders.\n\nAs Reinfeldt prepares to assume the rotating presidency of the EU on Wednesday, he says it is a pity Cameron has decided to leave the main centre-right grouping in the European parliament, the EPP-ED, adding that he will need to adopt a more pragmatic approach in government.\n\n\"If David Cameron becomes prime minister, part of what he wants to do in the world and Europe will need European structures,\" Reinfeldt says of Cameron's ambitions to tackle climate change. \"I hope he will feel comfortable in working with other European leaders. He will need us. To address this issue he needs European leadership, not only British leadership.\"\n\nThe intervention by Reinfeldt, who visited Britain yesterday as part of his preparations for Sweden's six-month EU presidency, is particularly significant for Cameron, who is close to the Swedish leader. Since Reinfeldt's election in 2006 he was inspired by Tony Blair as he modernised his party \u2013 he renamed them the New Moderates \u2013 and he has worked closely with Cameron as he introduces moderate reforms to Sweden's generous welfare system.\n\nReinfeldt also gave short shrift to Cameron's warning that he would be prepared for a battle with the EU even if the Lisbon treaty had been ratified by the time of a Tory election victory. Reinfeldt, who hopes the measure will enter EU law during his presidency if Ireland votes yes in a referendum in October, says: \"I will push on to try to get the final ratification in place. Then it is up and working.\"\n\nBritish diplomats have often held up Cameron's links with Reinfeldt as an example of the flaw in the Tory leader's plan. The two men see eye to eye on almost all issues, from climate change to labour market reform, and yet Cameron does not want to sit in the same group as him.\n\nReinfeldt, who says Cameron has influenced his approach to climate change, indicates he hopes the Tories would follow the example of Sweden, an instinctively eurosceptic country which has learnt to understand the benefits of co-operating since it joined the EU in 1995because \"that is in the basic interests of Sweden and Swedish voters.\"\n\nSweden is bracing itself for a busy EU presidency. Reinfeldt said he would have three priorities: negotiating a common EU position for the climate change talks in Copenhagen in December; ensuring the EU is well equipped as it emerges from the financial crisis, and dealing with the Lisbon treaty, which is likely to be ratified by the Irish in October.\n\nReinfeldt was diplomatic when asked his thoughts on one of the main consequences of the ratification of the treaty: the need to find a president of the European council, a post for which Tony Blair is the frontrunner. He declined to discuss any names and said the biggest challenge is to define the role, which is designed to ensure there is greater continuity in the work of the EU between the rotating presidencies.\n\n\"Either it is a very strong elected chairman, acting very much to give the answers for Europe, to be able to put up the agendas for the European councils, taking all the initiatives on the bilaterals with the other parts of the world and responding to parliament. Or otherwise it is more a chairperson of the European council meetings, more of a co-chairing position, with the rotating presidency prime minister or president taking partial responsibility for leadership, but together with the rotating presidency.\n\n\"Bigger countries are talking of the first role. Maybe the smaller countries are talking more about the other role. We will need to find a balance.\"", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=David+Cameron%2CConservatives%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+Union%2CSweden%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news%2CEurope", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "29/06/2009"}, "rank_222": {"title": "Ukip accused of 'hijacking' Easter Rising to help British Eurosceptics", "text": "The UK Independence Party has been accused of hijacking the Easter 1916 rebellion to help the cause of British Euroscepticism.

Like his new economic strategy, Cameron's current position on foreign affairs is fast retreating from his earlier commitment to a radically progressive Conservatism.\n\nNowhere is this more evident than on Europe. First there is the Conservatives' alliance in the European parliament with dubious, hardline Eurosceptics who have held antisemitic and homophobic views, an ill-judged association that is damaging Britain's standing and alienating other centre-right partners.\n\nThen there is the Tories' threat to renegotiate the Lisbon treaty once it is in force, which is only a matter of time after Ireland's emphatic endorsement last weekend and Poland's ratification on Saturday. (The Czech president's request for an exemption could be agreed at the EU summit on 29-30 October.) A Tory referendum on re-nationalising powers would turn into a vote about Britain's EU membership, causing unprecedented economic uncertainty \u2013 the last thing needed in the midst of a stuttering recovery.\n\nOf course Cameron won't repudiate Euroscepticism until the next general election for fear of losing crucial votes to the UK Independence party. But once in office, pragmatism will probably trump electoral calculations. The question is whether Cameron's realism can also prevail over the perennial temptations of populism and ideological posturing.\n\nWorryingly, he has so far failed to outline a positive and genuinely transformational, Conservative vision for the EU.\n\nIn his conference speech, he promised to implement a \"progressive agenda\" that would make the EU more accountable and transparent through decentralisation. But Cameron's proposed repatriation of powers from Brussels to London would concentrate decision-making at the national level, which is at odds with his own promise to deliver a radical redistribution of power to the local level.\n\nInstead of alienating European partners with more Euroscepticism, the Tories should adopt a positive stance and follow their own imperative of localism by arguing in favour of a Europe-wide decentralisation to the lowest possible level, including local government, communities and neighbourhoods.\n\nFor example, an incoming Conservative government could reinforce and extend the principle of mutual recognition of products and services to more areas of legislation that govern the operation of the European single market. This, combined with some minimal minimum standards, could limit and roll back excessive harmonisation, a perverse situation whereby the European commission can (and still does) legislate on the shape of tomatoes and the size of bananas.\n\nBy arguing for a change in EU law that favours mutual recognition rather than harmonisation, the Tories can help promote greater diversity and fairer (anti-monopoly) competition while also protecting British (and other EU) producers and consumers against a competitive race to the bottom.\n\nIn addition to the EU's important well-funded regional policy, Cameron could advocate a new EU local policy that blends shared principles with particular, locally specific practices. That, rather than simply empowering Westminster and Whitehall, would be a truly Conservative vision for Europe.\n\nThere is also EU support for modernising the UK's chronically underfunded infrastructure, including a recent \u00a31bn loan for Crossrail from the European Investment Bank. Or the potential of a EU-supported industrial policy for reviving Britain's manufacturing and industrial policy \u2013 another urgent task for the next government.\n\nMoreover, a renewed emphasis on localism would help restore a proper European tradition. Indeed, the principle of subsidiarity \u2013 devolving power to the most appropriate level \u2013 is enshrined in all EU treaties and given more importance in the Lisbon treaty. By appealing to this European tenet, the Tories can challenge the attempted construction of a federal super-state with a positive vision that is in accordance with Europe's founding fathers, not least Winston Churchill.\n\nRetrieving this vision would allow the Tories to repudiate centralised, Franco-German federalism in favour of something like \"subsidiary federalism\" \u2013 a legally guaranteed distribution of powers between the EU and national levels, coupled with a political programme of radical decentralisation to the lowest possible level. This would enable the EU to concentrate on what it does best (including cross-border banking regulations and green policies), while devolving decision-making in other areas to the regional and local level \u2013 or, where absolutely necessary, to national governments.\n\nThere are many other economic and political reasons for a new Tory approach to Europe. Sticking with vulgar Euroscepticism will boost the SNP's case for Scottish independence, and might spell the end of the United Kingdom. Moreover, the Tories' current EU stance will in time provoke a major rift with continental European partners, depriving Cameron of a unique opportunity to influence Europe in cooperation with his natural, centre-right allies who have a majority across EU institutions and the 27 member states.\n\nInstead of shaping the EU's future under British leadership, Cameron might be remembered as the first British PM to preside over \"little England\" \u2013 not exactly a glorious legacy for a one-nation Tory unionist. For this reason alone, he needs to start developing an alternative Tory vision for Europe.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=David+Cameron%2CConservatives%2CBusiness%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+Union%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "12/10/2009"}, "rank_301": {"title": "William Hague under pressure from US over Conservative allies in Europe", "text": "The shadow foreign secretary, William Hague, is to meet the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, in Washington tomorrow amid concern in the Obama administration about the Conservatives' European policy and Jewish outrage at their alliance with far-right parties with alleged antisemitic and neo-Nazi links.\n\nThere is growing unease in the White House that David Cameron's Euroscepticism could undermine the ability of a Conservative government to influence events in the EU, threatening to weaken Britain in the eyes of the US. Clinton, while anxious not be seen to be interfering in a domestic election, has discussed the issue informally in Europe.\n\nInfluential Jewish groups in the US urged Clinton to raise with Hague the Conservatives' decision to enter a European parliament coalition with a Latvian party, some of whose members participate in an annual service commemorating Latvian units of Hitler's Waffen-SS, and a Polish politician who has questioned the need to apologise for an anti-Jewish pogrom during the second world war.\n\n\"I think Churchill would turn in his grave. It is an insult to the tradition of this great party,\" said George Schwab, president of the New York-based National Committee on American Foreign Policy and a Holocaust survivor from Latvia.\n\nAbraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, the leading US organisation dedicated to fighting anti-semitism and one of American Jewry's most influential voices, said those outside Europe had the \"right to raise moral questions\", chiefly because the new grouping in Europe \"legitimises extremism, bigotry, Holocaust denial and Holocaust revisionism\".\n\nThe US is only now waking up to the consequences of Cameron's decision to order the party to quit the mainstream European People's party, which includes the parties of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and form a new Eurosceptic caucus, the European Conservatives and Reformists, with mainly east European rightwingers, including Michal Kaminski, of Poland's Law and Justice party, and Roberts Zile's Latvian party, For Fatherland and Freedom.\n\nThe Conservatives said Hague would discuss Afghanistan, the Middle East, Iran and the Balkans, during the Clinton meeting.\n\nThe Obama administration wants the UK government, its closest ally in Europe, at the heart of policy-making on the continent alongside Merkel and Sarkozy.\n\nAn American official, asked about the consequences for the US and about the far-right links, said: \"I do not see any upsides in the new grouping. I can only see downsides. In life it is normally best to do things when they have an upside.\"\n\nLouis Susman, the US ambassador in London, in an interview with the Financial Times, issued what could be interpreted as a warning to the Conservatives not to try to disrupt Europe.\n\nEuropean diplomats said Clinton believed it would be unwise to try to overturn the Lisbon treaty in the unlikely event that it has not been ratified by the time the Tories come to power. She is also understood to believe that it would also be unwise for a Tory government to try to undo earlier EU treaties.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton is concerned that the Tories would not take a lead in Europe,\" one European diplomatic source said. \"It is clear that this US administration does not believe that Britain's relations with Europe and the EU are a zero sum game \u2013 the wrong-headed idea that if you are close to one you can't be close to the other. The US wants Britain to be fully engaged in the EU \u2013 that makes Britain more relevant in US eyes.\"\n\nDuring his trip to Washington, Hague will also visit Congress for meetings with senators such as John McCain, who three years ago on a visit to Brussels warned the Conservatives not to leave the EPP.\n\nThere was a host of condemnation from Jewish organisations. Ira Forman, chief executive of the National Jewish Democratic Council, urged Clinton to take up the issue of antisemitic links with Hague. \"I think there is obviously concern in the US when there is legitimacy conferred on individuals and political parties that have had some association with antisemitism,\" Forman said. \"I think it is appropriate [for Hillary Clinton] to raise these concerns with Hague.\"\n\nUS officials watched with concern recent reports about Kaminski who questioned the decision of the former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski to apologise for the 1941 Jedwabne massacre of at least 300 Jews. Kaminski has condemned the massacre, but indicated it was wrong to expect Poles to apologise until Jews apologised for alleged involvement with the Communists in Soviet-occupied eastern Poland.\n\nFoxman described as \"wrong and outrageous\" Kaminski's views on the pogrom and his allegation that Jews were guilty of \"mass collaboration\". Foxman was equally scathing about the Tories' Latvian partner, the For Fatherland and Freedom party: \"Their celebration of the Waffen SS shows where their moral failure lies.

The Tory right? Eurosceptics more broadly? Other EU governments?\n\nHardly. All those groups have the measure of the Tory leader. The people he most confuses are the people he's tried hardest to appeal to: you. Liberals, progressives, sincere pro-Europeans \u2013 you're the people who now consistently fail to understand who and what Cameron is. Or rather, what he's not.\n\nFor if Cameron's a Eurosceptic, Euroscepticism's a dead word. In truth, the Tory leader is a worthy successor to Conservatives like John Major and Douglas Hurd. And just like them, in office, if he has a majority with which to do it, the people he'll be facing down will be Eurosceptics.\n\nCameron has never been a Eurosceptic. He's made this political decision much in the way that he decided to ignore student politics. Snobbery, boredom and calculating instinct were all perfectly good reasons for Cameron to avoid the mid-80s Oxford University Conservative Association. But it also meant that he didn't leave anything incriminating by way of opinions.\n\nSo it's continued. As he worked to get into the Commons, Cameron tacked this way and that, yet he never once allowed himself to be identified with any strong factional position. Once in the House, during his period on the backbenches, the pattern was the same. Of the plethora of Eurosceptic signs to be given, groups to join or statements to make, Cameron made none. This is not because he's hiding his opinions, but because the cause that so agitates Eurosceptics is, as recent events showed once again, just not his reason for cycling to work in the morning.\n\nWorse still for Eurosceptics, when Cameron says he wants the UK to be in the EU, it's not a cast-iron guarantee; he actually means it. In this, he stands fully in the tradition of Hurd and Major. He's not an enthusiast for \"deeper integration\", but, just like them, he finds nothing so very intolerable in British membership of the EU that extreme solutions might be required.\n\nThat word, \"extreme\", is central to Cameron's faction's self-definition. Before they started going on about anything else, before they adopted their present name or their current choice for leader, Europe was the issue that set them apart from the rest of the Tory party. For, as they kept saying, they weren't dinosaurs, like Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten or even Ken Clarke. Like Major and Hurd, they saw problems with Europe, but, in opposition the party, they grimly intoned, had fallen prey to its own self-obsessions.\n\nRather than talk about what the voters wanted to listen to, Portilloites, then modernisers, then finally Cameroons diagnosed \"stridency\". In the early years of this decade, the middle classes were polled, then polled again, and by salutary chance they thought just as Notting Hill did. This one-note opposition to \"Europe\" of Hague's, well, it was all a bit infra dig, wasn't it? Thus began the long journey that finally saw the circle of grassroots Tory scepticism squared with prospective governing expediency last week.\n\nYet, you're still confused. Surely Cameron is anti-European \u2013 by which you mean, he will, obviously, be in a small, dissenting minority when he gets to Brussels as prime minister, won't he? Of course, he will. Just as, for the vast majority of their time in office, both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown found themselves swimming against the continental tide.\n\nBritain, simply put, isn't very European. Both her main parties fail to share European idealism, beyond each equally dreading debating, let alone attempting, withdrawal. Why that is is a book in itself, reaching back to at least Suez, but what it's not is proof that Cameron is any more of a Eurosceptic than, say, either Hurd or Major ever were. The reason Cameron broke his referendum pledge, won't offer another, rules out running battles with Brussels and fails to detail any credible timetable for action on any of his scanty, vague-to-meaningless European ambitions, really isn't very complex. He's not a Eurosceptic. Eurosceptics who vow to stay quiet about Europe aren't, conventionally, sceptical. They're acquiescent.\n\nBeyond the BBC, leftwing politicians and commentators who are all doing Cameron the short-term favour of reassuring his grassroots by affecting that they at least all still think he's a Eurosceptic, something very big did happen last week. For Euroscepticism, a challenge that started 20 years ago is now effectively over inside the Tory party. Cowed candidates, MPs all too conscious of the fate of Howard Flight and a leadership firmly recast in the mould of Major and Hurd, have at last put it to sleep.\n\nModern Euroscepticism started as a revolt by a small parliamentary minority against the party's establishment; critically, it was sustained by the unique circumstance of an ex-leader, Margaret Thatcher, offering it support, thus rallying activists behind those MPs who braved the whips and central office; and after the 1992 general election, the collapse of Major's majority gave it its never, as yet, to be repeated parliamentary opportunity.\n\nHowever, even then, what actually happened? After the Danes said, in 1992, Nej to Maastricht, 81 Tory MPs signed the \"Fresh Start\" early day motion in June, urging Hurd and Major to seize this opportunity to let the Danes kill the treaty for them. When it came to the vote in the Commons on the paving motion on the treaty four months later, that 81 fell to 26 MPs who voted against the government. And by the time the government was finally at risk, due to John Smith's superb parliamentary tactics, even that small number halved.\n\nWhat's the relevance of any of that to today? Simply this: when the Eurosceptics were fighting Maastricht and Major, where were the people who now run the Tory party? Working for Major. Cameron was, George Osborne was, even Hague was. All these choices on Europe have been made before, and made long ago. Whether you're a true believer in Europe, or just content with the way things are, relax: they're not going to change under Prime Minister Cameron. The only people who are going to be upset are the people who always are: Eurosceptics.

And, I would argue, my \"Euroscepticism\" (which was so easily and wrongly translated into anti-Europeanism) should now more readily be recognised as all of a piece with the Keynesian view that keeping control of one's own macroeconomic policy, rather than handing it over to an unaccountable international central bank, was an important safeguard against recession.\n\nI was reminded of all of this by last week's Financial Times piece by the veteran economics commentator Sam Brittan. He argued that the introduction of the euro had been premature, and that the plight of Greece (and perhaps of other eurozone states to follow) was a direct consequence of failing to recognise that a common currency could succeed only if there was a convergence of costs across the whole economy \u2013 and if the common currency helped towards, rather than hindered, that end.\n\nBrittan's current view is of course in marked contrast to what he thought and wrote on many previous occasions. I recall that, in 1988, when Britain's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) \u2013 the euro's precursor \u2013 was a live issue in the Labour party, Brittan spoke at a meeting of the party's backbench economic affairs committee, and advised my colleagues to \"put Bryan Gould on a slow boat to China\" while the party changed its policy in favour of supporting ERM membership.\n\nSince Keynes is now once again all the rage, Brittan might quote the great man's famous response: \"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do sir?\" The problem here is that it is not the facts that have changed; it is the minds that were wrong. The arguments against a common currency across such a wide and diverse set of individual economies were as strong in 1988 as they apparently have now become.\n\nThe essence of the case for the euro (and of the EMS and the ERM before it) was always a political one. A common currency can only work and make sense if the whole economy is subject to one central monetary policy which must supplant other elements, such as a national fiscal policy, that would ordinarily constitute macro-economic policy. In a democracy, a power of this kind could only be properly exercised by a democratically accountable government. The unstated conviction of the proponents of a single European superstate was that this logic would mean that a common currency would inexorably lead to the creation of a single European government to provide at least the illusion of democratic control over what would otherwise be government by central bank.\n\nThe economic consequences of such an arrangement pointed to the same outcome. The improbability of the whole of such a diverse economy being appropriately served by a single monetary policy was so great that it could only be contemplated if a sort of Faustian bargain were struck by the participants.\n\nThe powerful advanced economies would inevitably dominate monetary policy which would be framed to suit their interests; and that would mean that weaker economies would have great difficulty in living with it. In the absence of the ability to deploy an independent fiscal policy or to devalue, their only recourse would be to deflate and accept unemployment. They could be persuaded to accept this only if the stronger countries would implicitly undertake to treat them as \u2013 in effect \u2013 social security claimants and recipients of regional aid, and that could be made palatable to the taxpayers of the richer countries only if they could be induced to see those in poorer countries as fellow-citizens.\n\nThat bargain has now \u2013 as evidenced by the difficulties that Greece and their euro-partners are facing and failing to resolve \u2013 broken down. The Greeks, having long struggled with an inappropriate monetary policy, are finding the required deflation extremely painful; while the Germans have reneged on their implicit undertaking to maintain the integrity of the euro by bailing out countries that find the going tough.\n\nThe collapse of that bargain may well signal the end of the eurozone. But it should also sound an alarm. We ignore the importance of a broader-based, democratically accountable, properly focused macroeconomic policy at our peril.\n\nThe economic interests of a wider European economy \u2013 to say nothing of small matters like a functioning democracy \u2013 will be best served, not by a forced but failed attempt at convergence through a single monetary policy, but by country-sized governments deploying all the instruments of macro policy to suit the needs and interests of the economies for which they are responsible. The European dimension should rest mainly on a high and growing level of co-ordination of policy and functional cooperation among separate and well-performing economies which see their future as developing together.\n\nKeynesian macroeconomics and a scepticism about forcing the pace on creating a single European state and economy should be seen as going hand-in-hand. As we now know, a failure to learn the lessons threatens recession and drags down all parts of an artificially constructed single economy. Hopefully, that has now become clear; and it might have served us well if it had been recognised in 1994.", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Greece%2CEuro%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news%2CEconomic+policy%2CEconomics%2CPolitics%2CBusiness%2CEurope"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "26/02/2010"}, "rank_245": {"title": "Edward McMillan-Scott: Standing up to extremism in Europe cost me my place with Tories", "text": "What the Conservatives say publicly about Europe is not what they really think, says the MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber\n\nWilliam Hague has been using positive words to describe the Conservative party's future relations in government with our EU partners. I have been around the higher circles of the party for long enough to know that a visceral euroscepticism has been growing there since John Major's day. I had a stand-up row with Hague when, while leader of the Tory MEPs, he tried to get me to back his \"Never to the Euro\" ticket.\n\nIt was chilling to hear the then party leader say to one very senior spokesman at an EU meeting some years ago: \"We can say what we like here, but it will be different when we are in government.\" I should have left then, instead of carrying on the pro-European fight from within.\n\nDavid Cameron shields his europhobes. No murmur was made when last weekend Lord Tebbit in effect encouraged Conservatives to vote Ukip against the Speaker, John Bercow, in the general election. The dog whistle is really at a lower pitch: that Ukip supporters know that there is a real home for them, back in the Conservative party. Dan Hannan MEP plays the same game, even declaring that he had resigned his spokesmanship in Europe to campaign full-time for a referendum on EU in-or-out. No slapdown there, either; certainly no expulsion. But then he is a chum of Sam Cameron's; they were at Marlborough College together.\n\nMy decision to join the Liberal Democrats this weekend was made easier by the vile letter the lawyers conducting my appeal against expulsion last year from the Conservative party received last weekend. They described it to me as \"intemperate\", and advised me that, since the party refused to supply any documents about my expulsion, there was no hope of a fair final hearing next Thursday at Tory HQ. So I withdrew from the appeal and thereby resigned from the Conservative party I have served more or less faithfully for 43 years.\n\nNo doubt my successful stand for re-election last July as European parliament vice-president against the \"official\" candidate from Poland's Law and Justice party, Michal Kaminski, put forward by Cameron's controversial new group, caused him some discomfiture. But the campaign of vilification against me when I explained my reasons \u2013 that Kaminski had a recent antisemitic, homophobic and racist past \u2013 was so bizarre that it began to attract attention.\n\nIndeed, Toby Helm in this newspaper was the most attentive. He had been present at the national commemoration in July 2001 of one of the most notorious massacres of the second world war in Nazi-occupied Poland. At Jedwabne in July 1941, more than 400 Jews were rounded up by their Polish neighbours and herded into a barn where they were burned.\n\nAt the time of the apology, Kaminski was the local MP and he made it his business to organise opposition to the commemoration. He denies this now, as he denies so much else of his easily discovered past, using the Nick Griffin defence: \"If I said it then, I would not say it today.\"\n\nLast week Cameron was interviewed by the Jewish Chronicle and assured its readers that he would bear down hard on extremism in Britain. This sits uneasily with a man who propitiates it in Europe.\n\nConservative press officers hounded Labour over Damian McBride. The same pack have been repeatedly reported to me by journalists as using heavy tactics. One hapless Yorkshire Post journalist was called one week by six Tory boys demanding a right of reply for Kaminski. He coolly and properly said that, if he accepted that, he would also have to give space to Nick Griffin. The same team put it about that I was antisemitic because I once met Hamas \u2013 actually to tell them to stand for election. They are out again this weekend distorting the facts about my defection to the Lib Dems. I am not bitter, but they are twisted. It is not a nice party now.\n\nA move to the Lib Dems is easier because I have known, liked and respected Nick Clegg for some years, whether as a key negotiator on trade while Sir Leon Brittan was EU commissioner or later as an MEP.\n\nMost of my family are liberals and I am comfortable joining the Liberal family. From being a liberal Conservative I have become a conservative Liberal. And it is not a nasty party.\n\nEdward McMillan-Scott is MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber and continues to sit as an independent vice-president of the European parliament", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2010/3/13/1268499711371/michal-kaminski-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cde4b64f9610fe9c4054442d1630c5b7", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservatives%2CThe+far+right%2CDavid+Cameron%2CWilliam+Hague%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2010/3/13/1268499711371/michal-kaminski-001.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a46a51dccaf1abf84e77537466ec129", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2010/3/13/1268499711371/michal-kaminski-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cde4b64f9610fe9c4054442d1630c5b7", "date": "14/03/2010"}, "rank_99": {"title": "Lib Dems could constrain Tory Eurosceptics | Edward McMillan-Scott", "text": "The issue of Europe is bound to be one of the stumbling blocks in any Conservative-Liberal Democrat alliance. The progress of Euroscepticism in the Tory party in recent years has been unchecked and largely unchallenged.\n\nDavid Cameron would argue that his \"let's not bang on about Europe\" policy has bought peace. But the factions, especially on the right, are still there. It is interesting that he spent Sunday night squaring both sides of the argument, meeting Sir Malcolm Rifkind as well as Theresa Villiers, for example, according to Sky TV.\n\nI have argued that the Tories would say one thing to woo Lib Dem waverers during the election \u2013 but would do another in government.\n\nThe letter which William Hague would have presented to EU foreign ministers in his first outing as foreign secretary this week was fortunately leaked to the Observer. It is unequivocally clear that the Tories are seeking a clash with Europe \u2013 despite claiming during the election that they were not \"seeking an immediate confrontation\".\n\nThe letter was drafted by the Foreign Office after long consultations with what was expected to be a Tory government. Hague was going to demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal justice as well as social and employment policies during the first term of a Tory government.\n\nHe knows \u2013 as the Foreign Office will have warned him \u2013 that some of this is simply not deliverable, especially because of Cameron's self-imposed isolation from the people who really matter in the EU, the conservative, Christian Democrat EPP.\n\nBut I fear that the strategy was deliberate. Hague is a very focused politician. He is also a profound Eurosceptic, with whom I had several battles while I was leader of the Tory MEPs. There is unfinished business in a man who gave the lamentable \"foreign land\" speech in 2001 and engineered the internal referendum which gave him a majority against the euro.\n\nMy belief is that Hague is one of many Conservatives who wants a bust-up with Europe so that the referendum they really want \u2013 on in or out of the EU, or the \"existential question\" the oh-so-silent Chris Patten used to talk of.\n\nOn one issue Hague may have exercised good judgment. On leaving the EPP he appears to have fallen out with Cameron. On forming the dismal and self-harming alliance \u2013 the \"bunch of nutters\", as Nick Clegg described it \u2013 Cameron made a gross misjudgment of great harm to Britain.\n\nWhen I made a stand against this link with homophobes and anti-Semites, I was expelled by Cameron, although I appealed. On 7 March, when Norman Tebbit encouraged Conservatives to vote Ukip in the general election on BBC's Politics Show, I waited for Cameron to slap him down. When he did not, I picked up the phone and joined the Lib Dems.\n\nIt is ironic that Tebbit's plea may have caused Cameron to lose his parliamentary majority: in 21 constituencies, the Ukip vote deprived the Tories of a seat. Added to their 306 current seats, that would make 327.\n\nCameron's links with homophobes lost him the 40% of the gay vote he had wooed: by the election it was down to 9%.\n\nA link with the Lib Dems may constrain the influence of the Eurosceptic majority on the Tory benches. Nick Clegg is not a Euro-fanatic any more than I am. He is an economic liberal who knows how Europe works. He wants Britain to lead in Europe, not leave Europe. Fortunately for the Tory-Lib Dem axis, the EU is not currently contemplating any major constitutional or other fundamental treaty reviews. Both parties have pledged a referendum if any were proposed, so there is common ground.\n\nAbove all, the Lib Dems need to be able to trust the Tories on international affairs and especially the EU. My long experience of fighting behind the scenes against the usually hidden hand of the Tory Eurosceptics suggests that the Lib Dems should just get some clear definitions of what is in the country's interest, and urge the Tories to set aside their ideological preconceptions.\n\nIf, as I prefer, there is a Lib-Con coalition or alliance, there are many areas of convergence such as civil liberties, economic reform, red tape or education. In foreign policy, they can agree on \"moral\" priorities like human rights and democracy, for which I hold the vice-presidential portfolio in the European parliament.\n\nI argued with the Tory diehards for many years over proportional representation and it appears that many are still too blinkered to see that they, like the Lib Dems and the minor parties, would benefit from reform.\n\nBut by ignoring the worst voices, always full of passionate intensity, and with good will, and above all with clarity, the centre can hold. And it must do so in the national interest.\n\n\u2022 More election comment from Cif at the polls", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/5/10/1273506357587/Nick-Clegg-David-Cameron-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8c8b0f26781ef8b51d00a7a1da56db5c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/5/10/1273506357587/Nick-Clegg-David-Cameron-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6cbe516d1512b8e55526ac9776629fb0", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=General+election+2010%2CConservatives%2CDavid+Cameron%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CNick+Clegg%2CEuropean+Union%2CHung+parliament%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CLiberal-Conservative+coalition%2CEurope%2CBusiness", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/5/10/1273506357587/Nick-Clegg-David-Cameron-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6cbe516d1512b8e55526ac9776629fb0", "date": "10/05/2010"}, "rank_67": {"title": "Tory Euroscepticism is being sidelined | Charles Grant", "text": "For those of us who hope Britain will engage constructively with the EU, the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition is good news. Even when Conservative leaders expected to win the election outright, they were not planning a confrontational approach to the EU. This is not because David Cameron, William Hague and George Osborne are sympathetic to Brussels \u2013 they are all Eurosceptics. Rather, they had worked out that picking fights with the EU would be a distraction from the central task of cutting the budget deficit and reviving the British economy.\n\nThat is why, when Cameron laid out his Europe policies in a significant speech on 4 November, he abandoned his pledge of a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. The tone of that speech was moderate, but he still offered several pieces of red meat to his party's Europhobes. In forging the deal with Nick Clegg, Cameron had to discard the reddest of those pieces. Gone is the promise to negotiate opt-outs from the EU treaties on justice and home affairs, the charter of fundamental rights, and social policy. The coalition agreement still retains a commitment \"to work to limit the application of the working time directive in the United Kingdom.\" But that merely requires legislation, and was in any case the policy of the Labour government.\n\nCameron will hope to satisfy his party's Eurosceptics with three promises in the coalition agreement. One is not to prepare to join the euro during this parliament \u2013 but nobody expected Britain to do so. Second is that \"the use of any passerelle would require primary legislation\", referring to a clause in the Lisbon treaty that allows the governments to agree \u2013 by unanimity \u2013 to switch decision-making in certain areas to majority voting. However, the act incorporating that treaty into British law already specifies that the passerelle cannot be used without the approval of both houses of parliament.\n\nThird, the coalition has agreed \"to amend the 1972 European Communities Act so that any proposed future treaty that transferred areas of power, or competences, would be subject to a referendum on that treaty \u2013 a 'referendum lock'\". But that is less significant than it sounds, at least in the short and medium term, for there is absolutely no prospect of all the member states agreeing to revise the existing treaties. Angela Merkel has talked of a new treaty to strengthen financial discipline in the euro area, but most governments think it would be crazy to go back to treaty-writing after all the difficulties of getting the Lisbon treaty ratified.\n\nSo those three promises do not amount to much. True, there remains a commitment to \"examine the case for a United Kingdom sovereignty bill to make it clear that ultimate authority remains with parliament\" \u2013 but this remains a strange affair, because when one asked the Conservatives what it meant they disagreed. Some said it was merely about putting into UK law the equivalent of the German constitutional court ruling on the Lisbon treaty, which set limits on the transfer of national competences to the EU. But some Eurosceptics said a sovereignty act should be used to strike down EU laws and European court of justice rulings, thereby challenging the supremacy of EU law. The Liberal Democrats will ensure that examining the case for such a bill does not lead to any action, and one senior Conservative has told me the bill will be left on the back-burner.\n\nIn short, I do not expect the coalition's policies to create problems for Britain's relations with the EU. If I was Bill Cash, I would be quite annoyed about all this. Indeed, I expect conflict in the coming years between the Conservative leadership (backed by the Liberal Democrats) and hardline Tory Eurosceptics in parliament and in the country at large.\n\nBut pro-Europeans should not be too relaxed, because the euro crisis is extremely serious. It will endure for many years and is already undermining trust and solidarity among EU governments. Against the backdrop of this crisis, it will not be easy for the British to develop a more intelligent conversation about Europe.\n\nIn any case, there will be events that provoke discord between Britain and the EU. For example, EU finance ministers are due to vote next week on the imposition of strict regulations on hedge funds; Britain may be outvoted, much to the chagrin of the City. Later in the summer, the commission is due to publish a report on the future of the EU budget. Arguments over the EU's finances are guaranteed to create rows.\n\nOf course, a government can often get itself out of a scrape if it has enough allies. For example, it may be able to ensure that a vote is postponed or a text modified. But ever since the Conservatives left the European Peoples Party (EPP), the leading force in the European parliament, to set up a new and smaller rightwing group, the European Conservatives and Reformists, they have not had many powerful friends. The governments of France, Germany, Italy and Poland are all in the EPP. Edward McMillan-Scott, an MEP who recently left the Conservatives for the Liberal Democrats, argued that the Conservatives should now rejoin the EPP, as a means of restoring British influence. I doubt Cameron will do that, given his promise to Bill Cash and other Eurosceptics.\n\nThe problem of British influence in Europe is about much more than alignments in the European parliament. In many European capitals there is a growing resentment that is not specifically directed at the Conservatives. There is a feeling that for too long the British have been allowed to get away with picking and choosing those bits of the EU that suit them, without being willing to compromise or show solidarity towards their partners.\n\nFor example, ever since the financial crisis led to a big devaluation of the pound against the euro, other Europeans have complained about Britain's \"competitive devaluation\" distorting the single market unfairly. And then there was the recent decision of Gordon Brown's government not to make even a token contribution to the eurozone's new \u20ac450bn bailout fund, which caused resentment; Poland and Sweden, though outside the euro, made modest contributions.\n\nSo although the coalition agreement is promising, it will not be enough to ensure a smooth relationship between Britain and the EU. That will require Cameron, Hague and other ministers to engage in some old-fashioned diplomacy, winning allies and making friends. They will need to offer to help other countries with their problems, in order to ensure that favours are returned to Britain. Clegg and other senior Liberal Democrats know that this is how the EU makes progress. They are well-placed to explain this to their coalition partners.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEuro%2CEuropean+banks%2CEuropean+commission%2CCourt+of+justice+of+the+European+Union%2CConservatives%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CEurope%2CBusiness", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "14/05/2010"}, "rank_275": {"title": "David Cameron signals new approach on Europe with visits to Paris and Berlin", "text": "David Cameron will visit Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel in Paris and Berlin later this week, as the government reaches out to EU leaders who have criticised the Tories' Euroscepticism in recent years.\n\nIn his first overseas trip as prime minister, Cameron will have dinner with Sarkozy at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace on Thursday night before flying to Berlin for talks with Merkel, who showed her dismay at Cameron's approach to the EU by snubbing him on a recent visit to London.\n\nThe French president and German chancellor, who have criticised Cameron's decision last year to abandon the main centre-right grouping in the European parliament, last week invited the prime minister to visit their respective capitals.\n\nThe newly co-operative Tory approach to the EU was on displaytoday when George Osborne, the chancellor, attended his first meeting of EU finance ministers (Ecofin) in Brussels. Osborne said the government would adopt a \"new constructive, engaged approach\".\n\nThe chancellor, who was applauded by his 26 fellow EU finance ministers at the start of the session, faced a difficult meeting because the main item was a draft directive requiring greater transparency from hedge funds and private equity groups. As home to 80% of Europe's hedge funds, Britain sees this as hostile to the City. Osborne has decided it is too late to stage a fight because he believes he has been given a \"hospital pass\" by Labour on the directive.\n\nGordon Brown arranged, with the socialist Spanish government, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, to delay the matter until after the general election. But the chancellor hopes that a key British demand \u2013 that hedge fund managers should be free to work across the EU's single market without having to seek the approval of the authorities in all 27 member states \u2013 would be considered.

The Treasury hopes that during these negotiations the single market proposal will be agreed. Britain has no veto because the draft directive is decided in the council of ministers by qualified majority voting.\n\nOsborne said: \"I arrived [in Brussels] with a challenging position bequeathed to me by the previous government, where there was not much support or recognition of British concerns.\n\n\"I am very pleased that the minutes [of the meeting] reflect my concerns. We now take the process forward. There is still much to play for.\"\n\nThe chancellor made clear, however, that Britain would oppose a proposal from the European commission to increase the EU budget by 6% next year, a move that would mean a \u00a3600m increase in the size of Britain's gross contribution to the EU.\n\n\"We had a lively discussion on the proposal for the 2011 EU budget, for which the European commission has proposed a 6% increase, including a 4.5% increase in administration costs\" said Osborne.\n\n\"I was not alone in saying that this is unacceptable.

But this week's survey from the Royal College of Surgeons brought it strutting into the catwalk of public consciousness. The directive that caps working hours at 48 has \"failed spectacularly\" in the NHS, causing staff shortages and reducing the time available for essential surgical training. Patient safety is at said to be risk. Doctors are worried. Melanie Phillips is cross.\n\nThe government, in its latest incarnation as Friend of Doctors, is also concerned. There will be a review. Stuff will be investigated. Everyone will look busy. And this is a concern. The survey from the RCS is not the first to raise the alarm over these working hours for doctors. Indeed, it's not even the first survey from the RCS to do so.\n\nAlthough the EWTD doesn't rate as very sexy in the big wide world, it's the suspender belt on which half of all conversation in the medical world currently hangs. It's a big deal. So why should a government review be such a concern?\n\nPrecisely because we have just had one. A really big one came out only a few weeks ago. The Temple review was commissioned by Alan Johnson, the health secretary before last, to look at the impact of the directive. It was over a year in gestation and came with a comprehensive review of the literature and evidence, with input from a massive number of experts. Indeed, no less than 92 organisations submitted written evidence, 42 gave oral evidence, and 29 took part in focus groups.\n\nAlthough it focused on training over provision, many of the concerns that came up were exactly the same as those of the RCS survey. But the conclusion was that \"any current problems will not be solved by either increasing hours or lengthening training programmes\". Instead it calls for a more \"consultant-delivered\" service.\n\nSo, if there's to be another review, can we assume the government has come up with dozens of new bits of literature and a huge swing in expert opinion in the last two months? I doubt it.\n\nMy concern is that this government plans to ditch the evidence of the Temple review and revert to a default position of blind euroscepticism and doctor-pandering, using one RCS survey as a scapegoat.\n\nJust days after becoming foreign secretary, William Hague wrote an article on a European politics website saying: \"It is, after all, very hard to argue that the hours that medical doctors work is something that has to be regulated at the European level.\" His article was followed by a memo from the current health secretary Andrew Lansley to RCS head John Black, in which he said he \"will, in particular, work to limit the application of the working time directive in the United Kingdom\".\n\nThere are some real and valid concerns around patient safety and the implementation of this directive, but amid the hand-wringing the government must not let a natural anti-Europe leaning dictate policy and lose sight of the fact that the 48-hour week is itself very much a patient safety initiative.\n\nOther high-risk occupations such as flying aeroplanes and driving lorries are also working within it and there is some evidence to suggest that doctors who work to the time limits are less likely to report errors. Indeed, common sense dictates that if you are knackered you are more likely to cock up, and if you are a doctor that can be pretty fatal. Longer hours present their own risks to patients.\n\nThere are daily anecdotes in the medical world of how the 48-hour week has led to hiccups and horrors. But improving patient safety by ditching a patient-safety initiative, without spectacularly good reason, seems rather counter-intuitive.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=NHS%2CDoctors%2CHealth%2CWilliam+Hague%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+Union%2CUK+news%2CSociety%2CAndrew+Lansley", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/10/12/1255364935096/A-doctor-with-clipboard-001.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=20039f7a34b6ca281eaa6247a20a6cbb", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/10/12/1255364935096/A-doctor-with-clipboard-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fec6683b1ae5dbd72bf4e5169e48eee0"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/10/12/1255364935096/A-doctor-with-clipboard-001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=fec6683b1ae5dbd72bf4e5169e48eee0", "date": "05/08/2010"}, "rank_204": {"title": "Capping surgeons' hours is a bad policy | John Black", "text": "Edward Davies's extraordinary article on the problems of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) reveals just how little understanding there is of the issues even within the BMJ. In choosing to use the divisive language of \"euroscepticism\" he does a huge disservice to the very patients he claims to defend. The Royal College of Surgeons is not interested in politics, our concern is the protection of patients and ensuring we maintain the UK's hard-won international reputation for high standards in surgery.\n\nLets be absolutely clear, the EWTD was legislation brought in across all of society with the aim of improving worker wellbeing. Although many have sought since to dress up its introduction in the NHS as a patient safety initiative, this simply is not true. In fact, even in that most modest of aims the EWTD simply has not delivered for surgery.\n\nOur trainees find themselves shunted into hated shift systems, unable to train and cross-covering out of speciality with fewer colleagues around to support them. All because hospitals are struggling to maintain their services with the decreased hours of doctor time available to them. We have heard of fixed annual leave and unpredictable rotas that mean these doctors can never know when they are going to spend time with their families. What is missing here is that quality of hours worked is at least as important as gross number.\n\nI would not wish to be treated in a hospital where handovers come so thick and fast that I never see the same doctor twice. Or be seen by a surgeon strung out with worry that they are working alone and not getting the operating theatre time because precious hours are being spent clerking in patients. And I especially would not like to be operated on in 10 years time by a consultant which the BMJ themselves acknowledge would have some 3,000 less hours of experience behind them than their predecessors.\n\nThe author also vaunts the Temple review as having been a rigorous assessment of the wisdom of the EWTD. We participated and it was nothing of the sort. The question of whether the EWTD should continue was never up for debate and the focus was simply on how training could be achieved within the current restrictions. This is not the same thing.\n\nDavies makes the critical mistake of trying to suggest that what is good for one is good for all across medicine. The New England Journal of Medicine has just published evidence from the US that shows how different the duty hour needs are across medicine. Surgery is an acute speciality with a need for 24-hour cover, which is low in intensity (we are there at night if needed and no more). The training is as much about technical dexterity and skill as it is about acquiring knowledge \u2013 surgeons, trainee and consultant alike, need operating time to develop and maintain skills. The current legislation leaves a sword hanging over everyone's neck as all time spent waiting on-call counts towards the hours cap.\n\nIt is interesting, then, that while on the one hand crying foul that the considered professional view of a thousand consultants and trainee surgeons doesn't represent evidence of a problem, Davies is perfectly happy to rely on his own \"common sense\" to tell him that the arbitrary 48-hour cap is best. The Association of Surgeons in Training and the British Orthopaedic Trainees Association both undertook a close analysis of what would offer the best balance between a home life and getting the skills needed. They concluded that, if time spent available on-call counts, surgeons should have flexibility up to 65 hours a week. This would mean we can train, maintain skill levels and mutually support one another in teams to provide patients with the best care.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281107564214/Surgery-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0e150e990f0a263ed5c48cdbd909294e", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=NHS%2CDoctors%2CEuropean+Union%2CHealth%2CSociety%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281107564214/Surgery-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3c2762fe253c537c291ffcac61a93d3e", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/8/6/1281107564214/Surgery-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0e150e990f0a263ed5c48cdbd909294e", "date": "06/08/2010"}, "rank_302": {"title": "William Hague heralds 'hardheaded' Eurosceptic policies", "text": "William Hague won a standing ovation from the Conservative conference today when he announced a series of Eurosceptic measures designed to curb the powers of the EU.\n\nActivists, who fear the Liberal Democrats have toned down Tory Euroscepticism, warmly welcomed a declaration by Hague that the government would adopt a hardheaded approach.\n\nThe foreign secretary, who famously fought the 2001 election on a pledge to keep the pound, said: \"We will support effective co-operation not navel-gazing, determined action not institutional empire-building \u2013 that is the hardheaded approach others can expect from us in Europe.\n\n\"The EU has many faults: it interferes too much, and the Lisbon treaty has left it beset by rivalries in Brussels, as indeed we warned. And we cannot forget that its democratic legitimacy was undermined by Labour's disgraceful failure to hold a referendum.\"\n\nHague announced two measures to shore up British sovereignty:\n\n\u2022 Legislation will be introduced in the next few months to reaffirm the sovereignty of the Westminster parliament. A sovereignty clause on EU law will be placed on the statute book to confirm that EU law only has primacy in Britain because parliament passed the 1972 European communities act. To cheers from the audience, Hague said: \"A sovereignty clause on EU law will place on the statute book this eternal truth: what a sovereign parliament can do, a sovereign parliament can also undo. It will not alter the existing order in relation to EU law. But it will put the matter beyond speculation. And it will be in line with other EU states, like Germany who in a different constitutional framework give effect to EU law through their own sovereign act.\"\n\n\u2022 Any \"ratchet clauses\" in the Lisbon treaty, which would involve a big transfer of powers to Brussels, will have to be approved by a referendum. Ratchet clauses allow for EU treaties to be modified without a full inter-governmental conference of the heads of government of all 27 EU heads of government. The most striking example highlighted by the government is the possibility of ending the national veto over foreign policy.\n\nHague said: \"Because the Lisbon Treaty was, in part, a self-amending treaty, where its ratchet clauses amount to the transfer of an area of power, there too, any government that proposes to agree to such a change will require permission in a referendum.\"\n\nThe announcements by Hague developed the thinking in the coalition agreement. This said a referendum would have to be held on any new EU treaty that transferred powers to Brussels.\n\nThe coalition agreement said nothing about \"ratchet clauses\". On British sovereignty, it said the government would \"examine the case\" for a UK sovereignty bill to make clear that \"ultimate authority\" rests with parliament.\n\nThe foreign secretary balanced his remarks by paying tribute to Nick Clegg for his help in forging \"firm friendships around the capitals of Europe\". The deputy prime minister was instrumental in persuading the Tories to drop their most Eurosceptic policy \u2013 the repatriation of social and employment laws which would have required agreement among all 27 EU member states.\n\nHague also used his speech to make clear that British troops would cease combat operations in Afghanistan by 2015. \"We have made clear, given the plans for Afghan forces to lead their own operations by 2014, that British involvement in combat in Afghanistan will come to an end by the year after that.\"\n\nLiam Fox, the defence secretary, who has been wary of withdrawing from Afghanistan too quickly, endorsed the 2015 timetable. But he issued a note of caution when he said: \"We will soon agree a plan for transition to the Afghan government. We now have to be patient and let the strategy run its course.\"\n\nThe defence secretary said he had a clear answer for people who wanted an immediate withdrawal. \"To leave before we have completed our task would be a shot in the arm to violent jihadists everywhere.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/10/6/1286375975419/Foreign-secretary-William-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d45f47adad475c6a053dd58be67eac79", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservative+conference+2010%2CWilliam+Hague%2CEuropean+Union%2CConservative+conference%2CConservatives%2CPolitics%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/10/6/1286375975419/Foreign-secretary-William-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=323978f7f39ae428d0a0d044c337f2c7"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2010/10/6/1286375975419/Foreign-secretary-William-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTAucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d45f47adad475c6a053dd58be67eac79", "date": "06/10/2010"}, "rank_297": {"title": "Brussels summit: Union dues | Editorial", "text": "Europe is in a mess. The European Union is in trouble. Today's summit in Brussels is unlikely to do much to help. David Cameron, like his fellow leaders, can only hope to limit the damage: and even as he does so he can hear the ghoulish sound of Tory Euroscepticism rising from the grave.\n\nThe summit faces trouble from three directions. The first is the enfeebled condition of many European governments. To pick the news almost at random, this week the Romanian government narrowly survived a confidence vote; talks on the Portuguese budget collapsed and President Sarkozy was battling (successfully) to pass his pension reforms. Ireland is preparing for another round of spending cuts; Belgium hardly exists at all. These are not promising times for effective deal-making between strong leaders.\n\nSecond, the European Union is in the middle of an indulgent institutional upheaval. The Lisbon treaty was necessary, but some of its consequences were not. Lady Ashton, Europe's new foreign minister, announced the other day that she will spend \u00a310.5m a year on new offices; the European parliament has voted for a 6% increase in EU spending next year, including a 4.5% rise in administration costs. At a time when most EU governments are cutting their domestic budgets, such things are provocative \u2013 and British Tories have been duly provoked. Yesterday Lord Tebbit warned Mr Cameron that he risked a \"Vichy-style surrender\" if he agreed to a budget rise. Last week 37 Tory backbenchers voted against one. The coalition provides some ballast: Mr Cameron is playing a more co-operative role at the summit than he ever could have done as a purely Tory prime minister. But his freedom is limited: even conceding a 2.9% increase in the EU budget will bring him trouble in his party at home.\n\nThird, and most serious, is the European Union's response to economic crisis. Germany, with a growing economy and unemployment now below 3 million for the first time in 18 years, fears being dragged down by its EU partners. Germans bailed out Greece and stabilised the eurozone. Now the German government wants to overhaul the rules to prevent future budgetary implosion. But the existing rules were not the reason Greece went bust and Ireland overspent. Changing them \u2013 which could require a controversial reopening of European treaties \u2013 is a distraction.\n\nBritain is still hoping to secure a freeze in the EU budget \u2013 which would be a success for Mr Cameron. He could tolerate the more probable 2% rise. But these things are trifles compared to Europe's search for economic growth. That is the challenge the EU is facing \u2013 and failing.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/29/1288343186203/Silvio-Berlusconi-and-Dav-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e43919b0ebd118498d51d7522a244249", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2010/10/28/1288293890375/EU-Summit-Group-Photo-Opp-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b99b66049197fc692f143ca86b981c7f", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/29/1288350426930/Angela-Merkel-and-David-C-006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ffd8150a2165d1337c762a57f34a4d9", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CWorld+news%2CBusiness%2CDavid+Cameron%2CPolitics%2CEconomic+policy%2CEurope", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "28/10/2010"}, "rank_250": {"title": "Polish PM accuses European leaders of hypocrisy", "text": "Poland's prime minister has accused western Europe's most powerful leaders of hypocrisy and myopia in the midst of what is being called the EU's worst crisis.\n\nAssuming the rotating presidency of the EU for the first time, Donald Tusk rounded on the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, and Britain over their handling of the sovereign debt crisis in Greece, immigration, EU spending and the budget. He charged them with posing as European champions while pandering to a new form of Euroscepticism for personal political gain, and of using fears about immigration to curb freedom of travel in Europe.\n\nThe passionate and optimistic defence of the EU from the Polish leader was completely at odds with the mood in Brussels and other EU capitals, where commitment to the union is being eroded by the rise of populist Brussels-bashing, squabbling leaders, and soaring mistrust between member states. In defiance of the gloomy European zeitgeist, Tusk said: \"The European Union is great. It is the best place on Earth to be born and to live your life.\"\n\nHe said he would use his six-month presidency to try to restore some sense of common purpose and confidence to a union in dire straits. Tusk is riding high in Poland, heading for victory in an October election that would make him the first Polish prime minister to win a second term in 22 years of democracy. He leads the only country in Europe not thrust into recession by the financial crisis, the fastest-growing economy in the EU, and where the EU enjoys high popularity ratings of more than 80%, not least because of the \u20ac10bn (\u00a39bn) pouring in every year from Brussels, making Poland the biggest beneficiary of EU largesse.\n\nHe dismissed talk of the EU encroaching on the sovereignty of the nation states of Europe, referring to his own experience as a Solidarity activist in communist Poland under martial law and Moscow's control.\n\n\"Until quite recently we saw a real restriction on our sovereignty,\" he said. \"We were truly occupied by the Soviets. It was truly an occupation. That's why for us EU integration is not a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.\"\n\nTusk's buoyant message from a booming country sounded like a plea to Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, President Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris and other EU leaders to shift course and try to reverse the sense of decline and defeatism seizing Europe. \"I just want to resist the phenomenon of the new Euroscepticism that is everywhere,\" he said.\n\nHe was not referring to the intellectual hostility to the EU that is the traditional British position, Tusk said, but a more insidious and hypocritical trend in countries long committed to Europe.\n\n\"The different phenomenon I am talking about is the birth of a type of Euroscepticism which does not declare itself. But it's the behaviour, the words, the actions by politicians who say they are for the EU, support further integration, but at the same time suggest actions and decisions that weaken the community.\"\n\nHe singled out the French and Italian campaigns, supported by many others, to use the north African upheavals to reintroduce national border controls and curb the travel liberties enjoyed under the EU's Schengen system.\n\n\"I sometimes feel that some forget, maybe because they've been using freedom of movement much longer than myself, a Pole, what great value it is to have freedom of movement in the EU.\"\n\nIn a dig at David Cameron, Tusk also lamented the months of trench warfare looming over how to divvy up the next medium-term EU budget, describing the contest as one between those who want the budget to be \"one of the main tools for European integration\" and those who want \"to give as little as possible to Europe\".\n\nDespite Tusk's plea to revive a Europe beset by weariness, frictions, and attempts to re-nationalise policymaking, the divisions were again evident when finance ministers of the 17 countries using the euro cancelled an emergency meeting on Greece scheduled for Sunday.\n\nThe meeting had been billed as crucial to frame a new bailout of Greece after the country's prime minister, George Papandreou, in Athens delivered on the EU's terms last week by securing parliamentary backing for a savage austerity package ordered by Brussels and Berlin.\n\nTusk was scathing of the EU's halting response to the 18-month Greek crisis. His criticism was echoed in an unusual intervention by the German president, Christian Wulff, who challenged the dithering by Merkel and Europe. \"Europe is about giving and taking and you have to communicate that,\" Wulff told the Hamburg weekly Die Zeit. \"Europe and the euro are worth German's special efforts because both are exactly in Germany's interests.

But amid the crisis a new breed of Eurosceptic is emerging, one that senses an opportunity to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe once and for all.\n\nEver since Britain joined the European Economic Community in 1973, a significant portion of the country has favoured less involvement with continental politics.\n\nNow, with the eurozone facing a debt crisis on several fronts, so-called Eurosceptics sense an opportunity to substantially retreat from what is now a European Union comprising 27 member states.\n\nThe debate over Britain's involvement in Europe and its exposure to the continent's troubled economy is likely to be played out at this year's political party conference season. With this in mind, Anne Perkins looks at the recent history of British Euroscepticism and its current standing.\n\nMats Persson, director of the thinktank Open Europe, detects a marked decline in support for the EU across its member states - especially in Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Conservative backbenches, a new Eurosceptic pressure group is being formed. Douglas Carswell says it's important to avoid saying \"I told you so\", while Dominic Raab is careful to stress that Euroscepticism should not be confused with hostility to Europe, its people or its culture. The new backbench grouping has the potential to cause the government problems, but Tim Montgomerie, editor of ConservativeHome wonders exactly how distant it is from the Tory leadership.\n\nWe also hear from Martin Kettle, Larry Elliott and John Palmer. The Guardian trio co-authored a short book in 1997 on the debate over Britain's option to enter the single currency. The authors revisit their arguments and explore how they have stood up to reality. On one thing at least they can agree: it is not in Britain's interest to have the eurozone break up. Paradoxically, that is also the view of Eurosceptic Conservative chancellor George Osborne.\n\nHowever, as former Labour Europe minister Denis MacShane points out, right across Europe, politicians are latching on to an easy way to score points: bashing Brussels and denigrating the EU. With the status quo appearing increasingly unstable, the EU faces a fork in the road: further integration or a move back towards more independent nation states.\n\nLeave your thoughts below.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/13/1300028177890/european-flags-003.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=165a05e3ed6e00ebcbadea1c83365a2f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEuro%2CEurope%2CEurozone+crisis%2CGermany%2CFrance%2CConservatives%2CLabour%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CPolitics%2CTim+Montgomerie", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/13/1300028177890/european-flags-003.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c53931492fcb7fa50a1b97fea4c8cde8", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2018/01/15/Politics_Podcast_Badge_3000_x_3000.jpg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/3/13/1300028177890/european-flags-003.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=165a05e3ed6e00ebcbadea1c83365a2f", "date": "01/09/2011"}, "rank_306": {"title": "Now is the time for Ed Miliband to be vocal, not silent, on Europe | Daniel Fiott", "text": "In his 2010 party conference speech, Ed Miliband mentioned \"Europe\" five times: twice when talking of how his family crossed the continent to avoid nazism, twice when speaking on workers' rights and immigration and once when discussing the need for peace in the Middle East. But at a critical juncture for Europe and Britain, both faced with the contagion of the sovereign debt crisis and sluggish growth and job prospects, Miliband's Labour has been eerily silent on Europe of late.\n\nTo be sure, there is a pro-Europe vacuum in Britain. With the Conservative party's continued EU-cynicism, fired on by recent calls from party hardliners to \"get tough on Europe\", and the Liberal Democrats' previously pro-European stance now muted because of the constraints of coalition politics, only the Labour party remains in making the case for the EU in Britain, and vice versa.\n\nYet Miliband has shown little enthusiasm in filling the pro-European void, and appears content in allowing Euroscepticism to fester. Neither has the Labour shadow cabinet moved on this issue. Indeed, only old New Labour figures such as Peter Mandelson and David Miliband have recently made compelling and cogent appraisals of the crisis.\n\nOf course, Labour's reticence on the EU is largely explained by the party's need to win at the 2015 general election, with a Brownite strain of Euroscepticism surfacing in the party to meet this one objective. Past talk of reviewing policies such as the freedom of movement of people is not only populist in tone, it also misses the bigger picture of a wider crisis of European social democracy.\n\nIf Labour is serious about its mantra of \"openness and fairness\", it must make it clear that the welfare of the British public is unequivocally bound up with Europe. How is Britain going to create jobs without growth on the continent? Yet at a time when the coalition government is hampering European-wide investment for growth by squeezing the EU budget, Labour still remains silent.\n\nLabour has also been unimpressive on financial market regulation. On the idea of a Tobin tax, for example, Labour made little of the necessity for a more effective Europe-wide implementation of the tax, even though no such initiative can flourish with just a handful of participants.\n\nNeither has the party made any convincing stand on the issue of defence. Labour's message over the coalition's defence cuts has been repetitive, and no single member of the opposition has made the case for European defence integration to meet these spending cuts.\n\nSupporting a pro-European agenda in British politics is no easy task, but Labour will not be able to meet its political ideals if it gives into the rising tide of conservatism domestically and in Europe. Protectionism and populism is not the way to deal with an increasingly uncertain and fragile global economy.\n\nIf Miliband is therefore serious about seizing \"the mantle of progressive politics and shap[ing] the economic, ideological and political landscape of the future\", then he will have to overcome the Eurosceptic elements in his own party. He must realise that leadership is sometimes about defying public sentiment.\n\nMiliband's Labour may have brushed Europe under the carpet for the time being, but this is an untenable position over the longer term. The real test for him and his party will be whether he can find the voice to argue for a European solution to European problems.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/9/7/1315395170312/Labour-leader-Ed-Miliband-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3b7001ea4087b4316170aa822615773f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/9/7/1315395170312/Labour-leader-Ed-Miliband-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1bae47d7aa4615db845fc0cb98c76a12", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Europe%2CWorld+news%2CEd+Miliband%2CPolitics%2CLabour%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/9/7/1315395170312/Labour-leader-Ed-Miliband-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3b7001ea4087b4316170aa822615773f", "date": "07/09/2011"}, "rank_89": {"title": "Europe destroyed two Tory PMs. And now it's Cameron's problem", "text": "While Tory MP Steve Baker conducted his weekly surgery in High Wycombe on Friday, the phone rang constantly. \"Lots of constituents got in touch, urging me to vote for a referendum on Europe,\" he said. \"And members of my association did the same. It is the first time on any issue that I have had that kind of response.\"\n\nAs it turns out, they need not have bothered. Baker, a young MP who entered parliament only in 2010, is already a fully developed muscular Eurosceptic. He had decided days before that he would rebel in Monday's Commons vote on whether the people should be granted a referendum on UK membership of the European Union. \"Personally I think reform of the EU is impractical and that we should come out,\" he said. \"So I will be backing the motion.\"\n\nAcross the country, Tory MPs \u2013 many of whom are worried about retaining their seats after boundary changes \u2013 have been ordered by their constituents to do the same, or else.\n\nAt Westminster, however, the pressure on them has been to do precisely the opposite. David Cameron and his whips are making clear they expect Conservatives to vote against Monday's motion. Their argument is that the UK must help to shape a better, more economically successful Europe from within and that now, of all times, is not the moment for a noisy revival of Brussels-bashing.\n\nAnother Tory backbencher from a rural seat said he had been taken aback by the strength of public feeling. \"There is not a single person in the constituency who I have talked to in the last few days who does not think we should vote on getting out of the EU. The feeling is very, very strong,\" he said. But against that he had to weight the demands of the whips: \"It is not easy when you have these competing pressures.\"\n\nUnder Cameron's leadership it was not supposed to be like this. Before the general election in May last year, he pleaded with his party to stop \"banging on\" about an issue which he had seen destroy the premierships of the two Conservative prime ministers before him, Margaret Thatcher and John Major.\n\nCameron was determined that his modernisation of the party would mean it being less obsessional and more pragmatic about the EU. \"In Europe, not run by Europe,\" has been his line.\n\nBut this weekend European divisions are back and are threatening to destabilise both the Conservative party and the coalition government it has formed with the pro-EU Liberal Democrats. Today much of the Tory party is trying to engineer a way out of the EU at the very moment their party's leadership is working desperately, along with heads of other member states, to mend it. On Sunday Cameron \u2013 assuming the role of European statesman \u2013 will take his place at an EU summit in Brussels to try to find a way save the euro and bail out the eurozone economy.\n\nOn Saturday chancellor George Osborne was in the EU capital discussing with finance ministers how to recapitalise Europe's banks in order to prevent meltdown of the sector if Greece defaults on its debts and other member states follow suit. Along with foreign secretary William Hague, once a forceful Eurosceptic but nowadays more the diplomat, they have been drawn in to the euro crisis and find themselves at the centre of arguments about its future.\n\nThe reality of government has taken precedence over Eurosceptic instincts. They insist that Britain's self-interest depends on a successful eurozone. The consequences of it imploding would be disastrous for the UK economy. As economies become ever more interdependent what happens to the eurozone matters greatly to Britain. So they take their place in the EU councils while sections of their own party at home seek the exit door and Conservatives tear themselves apart on an issue that simply never goes away.\n\nCameron will win by a large margin on Monday as most Tory MPs toe the line under pressure. The vast majority of Labour members will also vote against the motion, as will the Lib Dems.\n\nThe vote was triggered by a petition on the Downing Street website, calling for a referendum, which attracted more than 100,000 signatures. MPs decided that this merited a Commons vote.\n\nThe motion calls on the government to bring forward a referendum in the next session of parliament for the holding a referendum on whether the UK \"(a) should remain a member of the European Union on the current terms; (b) leave the European Union; or (c) re-negotiate the terms of its membership in order to create a new relationship based on trade and co-operation\".\n\nBut Cameron is being told by his party that victory will come at huge cost. More than 60 rebel Tory MPs had signed the motion by late on Friday, along with more than a dozen Labour members. If most of those Tories stand firm Cameron will suffer the biggest revolt against his leadership so far. Several ministerial aides could also resign, throwing away their chances of promotion to junior ministerial rank in the next reshuffle.\n\nFor many among the rebels, the turmoil in the eurozone, rather than being a moment for the UK to engage, offers the reverse \u2013 a \"now or never\" moment to force a profound renegotiation of the UK's relationship with the EU, or, for some like Baker, a once in a lifetime chance to exit altogether.\n\nTo this group, such issues are more important than loyalty to Cameron, who in their eyes is fast becoming a traitor to the cause of Euroscepticism. They like to list his betrayals. Many remember how he promised them a Eurosceptic flavour to his leadership and say he has failed to deliver. They are still angry that before the last election he abandoned his \"cast iron\" guarantee to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. In 2009, before the European elections, they recall how he attacked Gordon Brown for refusing to support a plebiscite. \"First he was against the constitution,\" said Cameron of Brown. \"Then he was for it; one day he promised a referendum, the next he backtracked. While he has chopped and changed, our position has remained exactly the same. We are the only major party to have consistently said that it is up to the British people to decide on our future in Europe.\"\n\nHis opponents say he should give them the chance now, adding that after forming the coalition with the Lib Dems, he shelved plans to take back powers over employment and social policy from Brussels in order to appease Nick Clegg's party. (Much of the current fury is fuelled by a belief that Cameron's European policy is being framed by the demands of Liberal Democrats.) But the last straw for many came last week when team Cameron let it be known that the party was likely to impose a three-line whip on Monday's vote, ordering MPs to oppose the referendum that so many of their constituents want.\n\nLord Tebbit , the veteran Tory Eurosceptic and former party chairman, tore into the prime minister, warning that people would leave the party in droves. \"One can only guess at the effect on the public if a mixture of threats, cowardice and clever procedural manoeuvring again denies them the chance to express their views on our membership of the European Union,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be no benefit to the prime minister, the government or the Conservative party from this. On the other hand, Nigel Farage and Ukip must be laughing their socks off. There must be many Tories who have stuck to the party through thick and thin \u2013 in my case for 55 years \u2013 who will be wondering if it is worthwhile any more. David Cameron may get his way next week, but the price at next year's European elections could be bloody.\"\n\nEqually, Tories ask, how does a three- line whip against a referendum fit with Cameron's advocacy of people power, giving citizens a say over their lives, and his vision of a big society?\n\nMonday's vote was brought about by a Downing Street petition of the kind Cameron is keen to encourage. But as soon as the consequences of that exercise in democracy loomed \u2013 and it appeared that many Tory MPs would vote in favour \u2013 the government panicked and the arm twisters were called into action to throttle the voice of the people.\n\n\"It is sheer hypocrisy,\" said one senior Tory MP. \"He will regret this because he can't ride two horses at once.\" Rather than killing off the rebellion by ordering MPs to comply with his will, he has merely stoked it, his critics say, by denying them the right to speak out and reflect their constituents' concerns.\n\nOn this point there is support for the Tory rebels from influential Labour figures; this is not just an argument inside the Conservative party. At least a dozen Labour MPs are expected to defy their own party's three-line whip and vote for a referendum.\n\n\"This is about democracy,\" said Jon Cruddas, Labour MP for Dagenham, who wants a referendum but would then vote to stay in. \"This is not about if you are for or against Europe. It is about respecting the people. Successive generations have not had a say on the European debate. All parties have promised a referendum over the last couple of years. This will fester until a proper open discussion is allowed by the political class. If we do not, anger and resentment will grow.\"\n\nEven some ardent pro-Europeans such as Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, now support a referendum on Europe, to settle the arguments once and for all. \"I support a referendum because I am pro-democracy, not because I am anti-EU,\" she said. \"A referendum would be an opportunity to debate the end goal of the EU \u2013 to get away from polarised arguments over 'more Europe' or 'less Europe' and ask the question 'What purpose, Europe?'\"\n\nThis weekend there is little sign of Cameron giving ground and allowing his MPs greater freedom to vote as they wish. It seems he has made up his mind to take on his party over Europe, citing the national interest and the interests of the European and global economies. A referendum now would distract from more urgent economic tasks at hand.\n\nIt is a message which he seems to believe plants him firmly on the centre ground and one that will allow him to continue working with the Lib Dems, who would reject any move towards the repatriation of powers, let alone leaving the EU. Hague issued the same message on Saturday, insisting that he still wanted to bring powers back from the EU to the UK. \"But a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, especially at this time of profound economic uncertainty, is not the answer,\" he added.\n\nBut if not now, then when, ask the sceptics. They see the history of the past 20 years as one in which the UK has been sucked in ever deeper, despite promises to the contrary from Tory leaders.\n\nAs they look ahead, they see further dangers. The most immediate fear is that, as the eurozone plots a course towards fiscal union and forms its own inner core of decision-making to do so, Britain will be locked out of crucial discussions on the future of the single market which it so strongly supports.\n\nCharles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform, says they are right to be worried but that the answer is to insist on being in on talks, not withdrawing from them. \"The countries that most believe in the single market, such as the UK, Sweden, Denmark and Poland, are outside the euro,\" he said. \"Technically, single market rules will still be decided by all 27 countries. But in practice the 17 euro countries \u2013 many of which are economically illiberal \u2013 will discuss market rules among themselves and caucus. By the time the UK and other countries outside the euro get to discuss these rules, many of the arguments will have been lost and won.\"\n\nSo, according to Grant, Britain should be upping its input rather than contemplating disengagement. \"Britain needs to be in the room when the euro countries meet,\" he said, \"so that it can influence the argument and ensure that what the 17 do will not damage the market or British interests. The British government has said that it does not want to take part in meetings of euro countries, for fear that it will be asked to contribute to bailouts. That is a mistake. Britain should argue for the right to speak at such meetings and just refuse to pay for bailouts.\"\n\nCameron is now having to handle a party \u2013 just as Major did at the time of Maastricht in the early 1990s \u2013 that is profoundly worried about the direction in which Europe is going as the EU approaches a fork in the road.\n\nThe prime minister insists it is in the UK's interest to shape the future from within. Much of party has heard that argument too often before. MPs want him to commit to repatriation of powers at the very least, which he is reluctant to do until the shape of a new Europe is known.\n\nThe pressure is building. As the global, European and UK economies head downhill, many will see the euro crisis as one of the causes of that downturn. And as people lay the blame at the euro's door, those calling for a referendum on our membership of the EU may find even more supporters than the huge numbers they have accumulated already.", "images": ["https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Andrew-Rawnsley,-L.png", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/10/22/1319306312738/David-Cameron-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3ca966f02795fa78476df19d4c7869e7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/10/22/1319294193901/Lord-Tebbit-005.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ccca16681b4780cc86013f745c563d7a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2011/10/22/1319285930683/Protesters-in-Berlin-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7e4907df13b69e923eab634272f6d48d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/10/22/1319294193901/Lord-Tebbit-005.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=703534b86c4259e2e80d1265d0d464fd", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Toby_Helm,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=efac6e0fb2b25929cd3b691d69c9d2ef", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=David+Cameron%2CConservatives%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CBrexit"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/10/22/1319294193901/Lord-Tebbit-005.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ccca16681b4780cc86013f745c563d7a", "date": "22/10/2011"}, "rank_127": {"title": "Letters: A way forward for Labour and Europe", "text": "Almost any attempt to fill the blank page that is Labour's current European policy is welcome, and Douglas Alexander's critique of the government's cackhanded Euroscepticism is well-founded (Our mature patriotism, 14 November). But he makes a mistake if he thinks that a negotiation of a treaty to beef up economic governance in the eurozone will have the leisure to \"look at the balance of powers between Europe and member states\", which at first sight seems not so different from the Tory agenda. In fact, precisely because Britain has such an overwhelming economic interest in strengthening the euro's structures, it would be harmful to Britain's growth prospects were we to seek to complicate the intergovernmental conference necessary to agree treaty changes.\n\nA Labour policy for Europe can surely not be limited to strengthening the internal market and an \"amplification of Europe's voice\" on the world stage. A progressive policy for growth should be at the heart of Labour's strategy, which means far more than extending the internal market to services. It requires using the European Investment Bank and the EU budget for infrastructure and social investment on a scale much greater than recent commission proposals. It means much more visible support for EU R&D and innovation. It means the EU taking a tougher line against distortions in world trade from competitor countries, which respect no acceptable social and environmental norms. It means tougher EU-wide controls on irresponsible practices in our financial services. And it means a Europe-wide transactions tax.\n\nAnd so far there is not a word from Alexander about methods. Labour's great strength in Europe is that, unlike the Tories, it is not in a political isolation ward.

Labour's leadership should be at the forefront of a social democratic fightback in Europe, based on a practical European-wide programme for investment and jobs.\n\nJulian Priestley\n\nWaterloo, Belgium\n\n\u2022 So now this is it (The full Monti, 14 November)? First Greece, now Italy; who is next? A new era indeed. Having dabbled with democracy and seen the consequences \u2013 record deficits, national bankruptcy and bunga-bunga parties \u2013 Europe has chosen the surgical precision of the markets as a replacement for the outdated ritual of regularly asking poor villagers to place an X besides an egotist in the misplaced belief that they then have a say in the running of the country. From now on the entire coronation will be rehearsed and executed with ruthless efficiency at the stock exchange. After all, the market is always right, right?\n\nThe thing nobody seems to notice is that, like a zombie rampaging through a sleepy village, the market's quest for blood will never be quenched by token blood-letting. As long as there is life in the eurozone, the market shall continue reaping victim after hapless victim. If you thought rule by incompetent political aristocracy was tough, brace for the market dictatorship.\n\nBlessing Museki\n\nLondon\n\n\u2022 Your editorial (11 November) misses the fourth solution to the debt crisis \u2013 systemic defaults by the over-borrowed countries. You note that the interest rates on loans increase the more the market distrusts governments. What is not explained is why, if the markets are accounting for risk in this way, they still get bailed out if their loans turn sour. In no other business can an organisation price-in risk to ensure profitability and have the fallback that if they get their sums wrong there will be someone to pick up the tab. It is time the markets realised that the more they speculate on countries' debts and the more they increase interest rates, the greater the chance of default. And the countries under pressure will have to be allowed to default when there is no other way out.\n\nThe IMF and the EU must stop buying up debt and propping up the markets, allow investors to make losses when they get their sums wrong, and be there to help countries post-default. This is the most difficult time: the markets will no longer lend to a defaulting country, so these countries will need help to get their economies back on the road. Tough medicine maybe, and one that will come back to hurt our pension funds, but ultimately power has to be with elected governments and not with profit-oriented markets.\n\nAlain Head\n\nLondon\n\n\u2022 Larry Elliott makes several sweeping allegations against the EU (This is no democracy \u2013 Europe is being run by a cabal, 9 November) including arguing that \"the latest phase of Europe's sovereign debt crisis has exposed the quite flagrant contempt for voters\".\n\nMr Elliott would do well to remember that it was neither Angela Merkel nor the international markets who decided that a Greek referendum was unwise and that George Papandreou had to go \u2013 it was his own finance minister, his cabinet and the Greek parliament. Likewise, Silvio Berlusconi was not banished by Berlin or Brussels \u2013 rather he lost the confidence of his parliament.\n\nItaly and Greece are representative democracies \u2013 prime ministers must command the support of elected members of parliament. The new Greek PM, Lucas Papademos, and Italian PM-elect, Mario Monti, both derive legitimacy from the support of the majority of the people's representatives. Furthermore, in an opinion poll in Greece's newspaper Kathimerini, over 55% of respondents approve of Mr Papademos's appointment. In Italy, CGIL, the largest trade union federation, is giving its backing to the technocratic government. People are celebrating Berlusconi's departure and the arrival of Monti. The picture Mr Elliott paints of a hapless public prey to an anti-democratic conspiracy appears simplistic and misleading.\n\nAndrew Byrne\n\nMarie Curie researcher, Centre for European Policy Studies\n\n\u2022 Larry Elliott makes no mention of one of the main culprits in the crisis, European social democracy. Within all the drama the voice of the mainstream European left has been absent. Why? Because too many of them bought into Clinton's third way, or have accepted the neoclassical orthodoxies of the Maastricht treaty and the European Central Bank (ECB). The crash of 2008-9 and its consequences have revealed the limitations of this approach.\n\nWhat are the options? The first, which has been basically followed by the Spanish, Portuguese and Greek left in government, is to accept the neoliberal story and pursue an austerity course. The second is to argue that the game is up for Europe and to accept that, as Martin Kettle wrote: \"the nationalist right and the global bond markets have won. The internationalist social and Christian democrats have lost\" (The nationalists have won \u2013 Europe's dream is over, 24 June). That defeatism is pervasive in Labour's ranks \u2013 Blue Labour as well as New Labour.\n\nNeither option makes sense for social democracy. Instead it should develop a realistic programme at the European level. The core story is fairly clear. Firstly, the left should state that the priority for Europe is economic growth \u2013 more particularly green growth \u2013 not austerity. That means rejecting the orthodoxies of Maastricht, the ECB and the Bundesbank. Secondly, it should support a range of measures which Europeanise the debt problem. Thirdly, the ECB should issue eurobonds, drawing on the basic strength of the European economy. Fourthly, the left should strongly back the commission's proposal for a financial transactions tax, both to rein in financial speculation and to raise significant revenues for new Europe-wide initiatives.\n\nNone of this is rocket science. Nor does it require any change to EU treaties. But it does require a coherent challenge to the monetarist mantras of the German financial establishment and the ECB. If social democracy wants to offer Europe-wide solutions, it urgently needs to get its act together. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is well positioned to challenge Sarkozy in France. The SPD-Green alliance is regularly winning regional elections in Germany. Ed Miliband has signalled his break from Blair and neoliberalism. When are they going to meet up and thrash out a common programme to answer Europe's crisis?\n\nJon Bloomfield\n\nBirmingham\n\n\u2022 Larry Elliott misses two important points. First, whatever we think of bankers, the world needs them. Why would bankers lend to countries that default on their debts and, if they did, why would they not demand a high rate of interest to compensate for the risk? That's economics 101. So not defaulting isn't just good for bankers, it's good for the citizens of the borrowing country. The second point is that in a democracy, voters bear responsibility for the actions of their elected leaders. Repeatedly choosing incompetents, panderers or buffoons who mess up the economy has consequences. When the mess slops over on to other countries, especially those with a tradition of managing their economies well, and the taxpayers of those countries end up paying for cleaning up the mess, it is not unreasonable that the price exacted be the departure of the bunglers, however duly elected, from the frontbench.\n\nPaul Clermont\n\nLondon\n\n\u2022 Martin Kettle is sadly right (Blaming Europe for Britain's woes is absurd \u2013 but it works, 11 November). The tactic has been used before, of course, and no doubt will be again, because it's so easy. But what happens when irreversible climate change is the problem and not \"mere\" sovereign debt? Well, there's probably a bright young chap currently in his first term at Eton who'll one day be saying, just like Cameron: \"Our policies will ensure our climate remains healthy regardless of what's happening in Europe, so vote for me.\" You can just hear him, can't you?\n\nJohn Smith\n\nSheffield\n\n\u2022 I find it interesting that European democracies find a mechanism for appointing technocrat governments to impose measures which are unpopular with the electorate in response to the clear and present danger of the euro crisis. Will it be a tragedy that human-induced global warming is unlikely to present such a clear and present danger until it is too late to act effectively?\n\nDr Rob Low\n\nLlanfoist, Monmouthshire\n\nRIP democracy.

The automatic right of appeal to the ECHR should be replaced with a requirement that permission must be obtained before individuals' cases can proceed to Europe, they suggested.\n\nTheir comments, before the joint committee on human rights, come as the government seeks to transform Britain's judicial relationship with the ECHR and tackle the Strasbourg court's huge backlog of cases.\n\nBoth Phillips and Judge agreed that the court did not allow sufficient leeway \u2013 what is technically known as the \"margin of appreciation\" \u2013 in interpreting general human rights principles in the context of domestic legislation.\n\nThey were both asked by the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Lester whether UK courts have been too strict in following ECHR case law. \"We have a tendency to be too strict,\" Phillips said. \"We pay great attention to the decisions and rulings of higher [UK] courts. That's what we are used too and sometimes we do it too much. Perhaps we analyse it in too much detail.\"\n\nJudge said that he agreed \"with great emphasis\". He added: \"We have approached a lot of the decisions of the European court system in the manner we would approached a decision of our own court. I think we have not been sufficiently flexible.\n\n\"Most of the decisions [in the ECHR] are not dealing with principles they are dealing with facts and that's not a precedent for anything.\n\n\"There's been a tendency to follow much more closely than we should. I think judges are generally aware of this and are examining the decisions of the [ECHR] much more carefully to see whether they are just looking at facts or principle.\"\n\nThe backlog in cases before the Strasbourg court was also criticised. \"They have 165,000 cases outstanding at the ECHR and that makes inevitably for an incredibly inefficient system,\" Judge said.\n\nAny appeal by individuals to the ECHR should, therefore, require permission for it to proceed. The court should deal only with points of broad principle not individual facts that do not raise points of legal interpretation, he implied.\n\n\"What the [ECHR] should be focusing on is cases that raise issues of principle,\" Phillips said.\n\nThat was why the UK's supreme court had been waiting for two years on one particularly thorny case to be resolved by the upper appeals chamber of the ECHR.\n\nThe decision in al-Khawaja, when delivered, and in that of Horncastle would have profound consequences for the UK's relationship with the ECHR, the judges said. In the case of Horncastle, the supreme court used the right not to follow Strasbourg jurisprudence for the first time.\n\nBoth Judge and Phillips declined to comment on the \"hot political issue\" of prisoners' voting rights, a diplomatic standoff in which the UK has so far failed to enforce the decision of the ECHR that inmates in British jails should be given the vote.\n\nArticle 8 of the human rights convention, which guarantees a right to family life and privacy, was baffling for judges to interpret, Lord Phillips admitted.\n\n\"Article 8 is one that Strasbourg has developed very significantly over the recent years,\" he said. \"We have been following Strasbourg down that path and some would say we have gone a little bit ahead \u2013 and they would be right.\n\n\"Article 8 is one of the most difficult [issues] we happen to be faced with. It's very difficult to pin down what is meant by Article 8.\"\n\nJudge warned that parliament should be aware of the consequences of the EU as a body acceding to the European convention which would result in the ECHR decisions becoming fully binding on all member states instead, as he believed, only requiring UK courts to \"take account\" of such rulings.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/11/15/1321385021912/European-Court-of-Human-R-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=75e5a08cd7b8e65cac312a259831e3c9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/11/15/1321385021912/European-Court-of-Human-R-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8ab364f2776953aede97eb58b829768e", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+court+of+human+rights%2CHuman+rights%2CLaw%2CJudiciary%2CHuman+Rights+Act%2CHouse+of+Commons%2CPolitics%2CHouse+of+Lords%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news%2CEurope%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/11/15/1321385021912/European-Court-of-Human-R-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=75e5a08cd7b8e65cac312a259831e3c9", "date": "15/11/2011"}, "rank_228": {"title": "'Tobin tax' would hit City of London with missile, says John Major", "text": "Sir John Major has warned that a Franco-German plan to introduce a financial transaction tax across Europe was akin to directing a \"heat-seeking missile\" at the City of London.\n\nHours after David Cameron failed to persuade Angela Merkel to drop the idea of such a \"Tobin tax\" in the EU, the former prime minister highlighted deep British unease over the issue by accusing Paris and Berlin of fanning the flames of Euroscepticism.\n\nMajor's intervention came as the prime minister visited Brussels and Berlin to discuss German plans for a revision of the Lisbon treaty to provide a legal basis for tough new fiscal rules for the eurozone. Britain would accept the treaty changes, which would only apply to the 17 members of the eurozone, if it wins assurances that the City of London would not be harmed.\n\nMajor, who is careful to make public interventions that are helpful to the prime minister, told Sir David Frost on Al-Jazeera English that the UK would fight hard to resist a Tobin tax. While this would be decided separately from the treaty negotiations, Britain could withhold support if its concerns about the tax are not met.\n\nMajor said: \"The proposal at the moment for a financial transaction tax is a heat-seeking missile proposed in continental Europe aimed at the City of London. If there were such a tax about 80%, 85% of the yield would come from the City of London.\n\n\"Now it is not surprising that the British are upset, if we were proposing [taxes] on luxuries like wine I dare say some of our continental partners would think we were being rather unfair to them. Well that's the position for us. We can't accept a financial transaction tax. I don't think we will have to, but the proposal adds to Euroscepticism and yet in many ways it's a paper tiger.\"\n\nMajor's interview was broadcast after Merkel told Cameron in Berlin that France and Germany want to press ahead with a Tobin tax (also called the Robin Hood Tax) as one way of helping to deal with the sovereign debt crisis in the EU. Britain would back such a tax in the unlikely event it applied globally. But George Osborne warned fellow EU finance ministers that a unilateral move would drive business to Asia and the US.\n\nBritain would be able to veto the introduction of the tax in the EU because all taxation matters have to be agreed by all 27 members of the EU. But France and Germany would be able to use what are known as \"enhanced co-operation\" powers under the Lisbon treaty to introduce the tax in the 17 members of the eurozone. Britain objects to this because the tax \u2013 0.1% on stock and bond trades and 0.01% on derivatives \u2013 could still apply in the City. The European Commission has proposed it should be levied on any bank registered where the tax applies. This means that any transactions of German-registered banks in the City would be subject to the tax.\n\nMerkel highlighted the differences with Cameron when she said in Berlin: \"We are at one saying that a global financial transaction tax would be implemented by both countries immediately. But just a European one, we did not make any progress. We have to both work on where we feel change is needed.\"\n\nCameron said: \"The danger, we have always believed, is driving transactions to a jurisdiction where it wouldn't be applied. So a global tax would be a good thing, but in Britain also we have put in place stamp duty on share transactions, a bank levy. We believe we are asking the financial services to make a fair and proper contribution to rebuilding our economy, to bring down our debts and our deficits. I think it is right in all countries to make sure that they do that.\"\n\nGerman and British sources stressed that Merkel and Cameron, who enjoy warm relations, held a constructive meeting. The prime minister is understood to have made clear to Merkel that Britain's concerns go beyond the Tobin tax amid fears greater fiscal co-ordination among the eurozone could change the single market. Downing Street is warning that it will oppose any moves towards \"caucusing\" among the 17 eurozone countries in which they agree a position on financial services and impose it on the rest of the EU.\n\nMerkel made clear in their discussions that she will give no ground on a key British recommendation \u2013 that the European Central Bank should act as the \"lender of last resort\" for the eurozone. Germany underlined its impatience with Britain when Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, the finance minister, said that all EU members would eventually join the single currency. \"This may happen more quickly than some people in the British Isles believe,\" he said.\n\nCameron received a mild boost on his first stop in Brussels when Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, told him that Germany has failed to persuade some members of the eurozone to agree to treaty change. Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, has told Merkel he would probably have to hold a referendum because German plans to give EU institutions, rather than member states, the final say over imposing penalties is seen as a major transfer of powers.\n\n\"The treaty change may be narrow but it will be deep for the 17 members of the eurozone,\" one British source said. \"If Angela Merkel wants to transfer significant sovereignty to Brussels she has to ask whether the technocratic governments in Italy and Greece will get that through their parliaments.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/18/1321647008536/John-Major-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f799f8d7b8376762af19be89358731a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/18/1321647008536/John-Major-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ab51dbe6201bb09955c5f65f71262051", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2011/4/7/1302173044373/Graffiti-in-South-Dublin--007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d90ae7603bf86a9cfcbcf10a7e59c2d9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/18/1321645178723/David-Cameron-at-the-G20--007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e17eb3f861fa7a663e7368a0c36173c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Tobin+tax%2CJohn+Major%2CEconomics%2CBanking%2CEurozone+crisis%2CEuropean+banks%2CAngela+Merkel%2CDavid+Cameron%2CEuropean+Union%2CTax+and+spending%2CGermany%2CEurope%2CBusiness%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/18/1321647008536/John-Major-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ab51dbe6201bb09955c5f65f71262051", "date": "18/11/2011"}, "rank_195": {"title": "David Laws: Eurosceptic approach will push UK to margins", "text": "Tory Euroscepticism will either result in the rest of the EU putting two fingers up to David Cameron or will push him to the margins, David Laws, the former Treasury chief secretary, has warned.\n\nHe also suggested the electorate will not give Labour or the Tories a majority at the next election, and promised the Liberal Democrats would fight the election as independents, even though they will not run away from their record on the deficit.\n\nThe former minister also expressed scepticism about further labour market reforms and said business will start to quit Britain only if they believe the 50p tax rate will remain indefinitely.\n\nLaws is still one of the most influential Liberal Democrats although he does not hold any formal office. He describes his current role as one of burrowing away on the details behind the scenes. He remains a key adviser to Nick Clegg and Vince Cable, the business secretary, and is still strongly rated by supporters of David Cameron.\n\nSpeaking at a Q&Asession at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a free market thinktank, he urged his Tory coalition partners to recognise they are in danger of throwing away their influence in Europe.\n\nHe said: \"Our big problem at the moment is that if we simply turn up at the EU \u2013 in a time of huge economic crisis out there \u2013 waving a list of UK demands without probably any allies, and without these demands being shared by anyone else, there are two risks. We will either get two fingers and simply achieve nothing, or we will gain some small concessions, but at the cost of being pushed to the margins.\"\n\nHe said : \"We need to understand there are many other nations in the EU \u2013 not just the new nations, but some of the existing core nations \u2013 that are quite attracted to the vision that we have in this country of a much more liberal EU.\n\n\"But at the moment they see the UK as being a pretty toxic part of the debate in the EU, and not a country that people want to be allied to because it is not a country that is often seen to have a productive constructive vision of where the EU will go. That means we are not in such a strong position to change not just the margins but the whole direction of the EU.\"\n\nHe said Britain would lose even more influence outside the EU, describing turning up to international conferences with the Norwegians and the Swiss as not very attractive.\n\nHe insisted his party could go into the election independent of the main two parties even though it had been allied totally with the Conservative deficit reduction programme.\n\nClaiming another hung parliament is likely, he urged the audience to \"think about the choices the electorate will face in 2015. Will they want the Labour party back after a period of government which we are still recovering from in terms of the economy. My gut instinct is no, and people will want Labour out for a longer period of time and that Ed Miliband will not be seen as having delivered as a leader and the economic programme of Labour is not yet credible.\n\n\"Are people yet going to want a Conservative majority government? I don't think they necessarily are, and I don't think they will see the government would have been better fairer, more liberal or closer to the centre of gravity of public opinion if the Conservatives had been allowed to govern by itself.\"\n\nHe said of the Lib Dems: \"We won't be divorcing ourselves from the last four or five years. We will have to stand by our record and the public will expect us to do so but both the Conservatives and ourselves will have a competing vision\".\n\nHe defended what he described as the massive cuts programme agreed in the wake of the election result, and pointed out \"there was real nervousness in the coalition negotiations on part of the Treasury and the Bank of England about what would happen if there was no clear strong majority government\".\n\nA \"confidence and supply\" arrangement in which the Liberal Democrats supported proposals on an ad hoc basis would have led to another election in the autumn and manoeuvring between the parties between May and October .\n\nLiberal Democrat support would recover he said by \"showing over a period of time that we were right to go into coalition\".\n\nSeen as one of the drier economic voices in his party, he defended the 50p rate of tax from critics who claim it is not raising cash and is driving out entrepreneurs, but with the proviso that \"it does not hang around too long\".\n\nHe said: \"The overwhelming amount of anecdotal evidence is that what people are really concerned about in City and business is 'will this tax last ?'. Most people who have very high incomes have a good degree of social responsibility. Most of them are pretty relaxed about this so long as it does not stay for a long period of time. If people expected it to stay then I think the economic consequences would be to see decisions to base economic activities abroad.\"\n\nHe still held out the prospect of electoral reform in the future, possibly as further coalition negotiation after the next election.\n\nDiscussing the disastrous referendum on the alternative vote, he admitted: \"We thought it was a modest reform that would be easier to sell to the British people: there was an assumption that we could sell this because any political change is a good thing due to the environment we were in. Voters find it much more difficult to understand how AV would work. Funnily enough it would have been easier to sell PR, because it is easier to understand instinctively and I suspect that if and when there is another referendum on electoral reform it would have to be on a different system.\"\n\nHe described schools reform as the second most important task facing the coalition apart from deficit reduction, but urged the coalition not to regard greater choice as a panacea.\n\nHe said: \"I believe passionately in choice and competition, but I do not think in all parts of the country it will be a cure-all. In many rural areas there is one effective catchment school, and it will be a long time before the free schools programme has made a difference.\"\n\n\"We need to make sure that we have a stronger accountability mechanism, so we do not allow schools to coast along in areas where choice and competition will not work. A lot of people do not shop around, a lot of people send their children to the local school because it is local and they do not have to pay a far bus fare, or because their aspirations for their children are not high or because there is not another school.\n\n\"I would not want to have rely only on competition and choice in education in those areas if it meant school children had to wait 20 years to get a better education.\"\n\nHe added he was not in favour of a major change in unfair dismissal laws beyond those proposed about an extended qualifying period.\n\nHe said: \"I have to say I do not see much sign that business is finding it difficult to get rid of people. We have just been through the biggest orderly shedding of labour in the pubic and private sector that we have seen in decades.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2011/11/23/1322046887007/David-Laws-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=99462c099e14a82613a1f8a593f7454e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2011/11/23/1322046887007/David-Laws-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6940dbb7c81642fa97f9a7787d097a50", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=David+Laws%2CPolitics%2CLiberal-Conservative+coalition%2CConservatives%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2011/11/23/1322046887007/David-Laws-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6940dbb7c81642fa97f9a7787d097a50", "date": "23/11/2011"}, "rank_209": {"title": "Your views on the news: Euroscepticism, Mars mission and strikes", "text": "An example: my mother is a teacher.

There were cultural shows, family exchanges, and long-standing friendships forged over the odd glass of vin rouge and toasts to European brotherhood.\n\nThis September, however, the Tory-run town council took the dramatic step of \"breaking off\" diplomatic relations with the French and the Germans. By 13 votes to 3 the Conservatives decided to end more than 46 years of town-twinning. Letters are this week on their way to the French and German mayors informing them of the decision.\n\nThe vote appears to be the latest manifestation of grassroots Euroscepticism. Although no reason was given for the proposal to \"de-twin\", Lib Dems say it stems from a visceral Tory hatred for the European Union. Two other rightwing councils \u2013 Doncaster, south Yorkshire, and Wallingford in Oxfordshire \u2013 have in recent years also voted to kill off twinning arrangements.\n\n\"It's a strange decision. None of us could see it coming,\" Mike Wood, a Liberal Democrat councillor, told the Guardian mournfully. The vote on 19 September was, he suggested, a kick in the teeth to the entente cordiale and Anglo-German friendship: \"It's indicative of modern-day Conservatives. They have this hangup about Europe.\"\n\nWood is the last surviving Lib Dem on the council, following his party's trouncing in May's local elections. (He opposed the de-twinning motion, together with one rebel Tory and an independent.)\n\nHe said the Tory-run council was generally pragmatic and avoided \"outlandish\" acts. But on this occasion, he said, it had suffered a moment of ideological lunacy. \"They [the Tories] are usually normal people. But whenever you mention Europe or the European Union they turn into some kind of monster,\" Wood said.\n\n\"I think Euroscepticism has grown. You see this in many walks of life. You see it in this parliament,\" he said, referring to last month's Tory backbench rebellion, in which 81 MPs defied David Cameron to call for an EU referendum.\n\nThe council's gesture has saddened those who have worked hard to build up cultural ties. Maggie Groves wrote to councillors, pointing out that the twinning association was \"still going strong\", with 60 people at this year's Valentine's evening. She said became close friends with a French woman from Villiers \u2013 the daughter of Polish Jews who fled to France \u2013 who had overcome her prejudices against Germans thanks to twinning. \"I cannot understand this decision. I am very distressed by it,\" she said, urging the council to reconsider.\n\nTown-twinning began in the UK more than a century ago, but it was after the second world war that the idea of municipal co-operation flourished as a way of promoting reconciliation and healing wartime divisions.\n\nThe logic was clear: bombed-out Coventry was twinned with Stalingrad and Dresden. There are tens of thousands of agreements across Europe with more than 2,000 in the UK.\n\nBishop's Stortford is, meanwhile, no Thatcherite ideas lab but a pleasant Hertfordshire commuter town. It has a population of 35,000. It is close to Stansted airport and the M11. It has a small ruined castle \u2013 actually, more of a glorified hill \u2013 as well as Cecil Rhodes's birthplace, and the ancient medieval forest of Hatfield. The royal hunting ground is popular with riders, dog-walkers and middle-class foragers. There is even an acclaimed state school, Hockerill Anglo-European College, which specialises in teaching and French and German.\n\nThe town's partners are similar in size, and are also run by conservative parties. Villiers-sur-Marne is a dormitory suburb of Paris, close to Disneyland Paris; Friedberg a satellite of Frankfurt, Germany's banking and commercial hub. The town was the birthplace of Erasmus Alberus, a humanist and friend of Martin Luther's. It has a Disney-style 14th-century castle, and a website proudly mentioning its \"Partnerstadt\" links. Bishop's Stortford twinning association had its own illustrious patron \u2013 the sculptor Henry Moore. Moore, who lived and worked in the village of Much Hadham: \"I am a staunch believer in European co-operation.\"\n\nJan Richardson, vice-chair of the twinning association, said councillors dipped into their own pockets to pay for annual meetings. They travelled on budget flights, and stayed free of cost with local families.\n\nThe argument that the internet and easier travel made twinning an anachronism was wrong, she said. \"I've heard the argument [against twinning] that everybody goes to Europe anyway. But this is different. You learn about the way people live. It's different,\" she said.\n\nLabour hasn't had a seat on the town council for nine years. But Denis MacShane, the Labour MP and former Europe minister, said he was dismayed by the rise of anti-European sentiment across the country: \"Municipal isolationism is the latest and saddest manifestation of Tory pathological obsession against Europe,\" he observed.\n\nHe argued: \"Town-twinning is a low-cost way of linking schools, civil society, local arts and sports clubs and learning about each other across frontiers. The Conservatives really do want to shut Britain down from contact with the rest of the world.\"\n\nBishop's Stortford's Conservative leader, John Wyllie, denied this. He claimed the council ended links with the continent because of \"lack of interest\".\n\nThe twinning committee would continue but the council would no longer be involved, he said. He admitted he had missed out on trips to Friedberg and Villiers-sur-Marne when he was mayor, but joked: \"I'm not bitter and twisted.\"\n\nAsked whether Euroscepticism lurked behind the decision to dump the Europeans, Wyllie was indignant. \"It had nothing to do with that. This is just typical Lib Dem rhetoric. They are playing party politics,\" he said. He added sarcastically: \"It's nice to see that they [the Lib Dems] have their finger on the pulse. People are losing their jobs in this town and all they care about is twinning.\"\n\nWyllie said he and his Tory colleagues had reached the conclusion that twinning was no longer \"relevant\" in today's society. He said that the town's thriving schools already had regular exchanges with other European cities. And what of the letter sent to the French and the Germans telling them of the decision? \"It was polite,\" he said.\n\nMichael Keller, Friedberg's mayor, said he wasn't surprised by the council's decision. \"The partnership has been on its last legs for the past 10 years. We got hints in 2005 they were keen to end it. Not enough young people have been involved. These days they go to China, Russia and the US.\"\n\nHe added: \"Twinning began for us in 1965. Those involved had personally experinced the catastrophe of the second world war. This isn't so relevant today. The world has changed. Europe needs new impulses.\"\n\nKeller said he would now talk to the French to see what they thought. \"I suspect English Euroscepticism played a role also. I would have preferred it if we'd ended twinning with a big party rather than just a letter.\"", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UK+news%2CLocal+government%2CConservatives%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CFrance%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CGermany", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/12/1/1322760788018/Bishops-Stortford-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=18c361701f15ecfa57a916da478f553b", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/12/1/1322760788018/Bishops-Stortford-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff28446f79a482715c432788d1c7889b", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2011/12/1/1322760788018/Bishops-Stortford-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTEucG5n&enable=upscale&s=18c361701f15ecfa57a916da478f553b", "date": "01/12/2011"}, "rank_238": {"title": "Why the Tory right no longer trusts David Cameron on Europe", "text": "MPs believe David Cameron's determination to succeed as prime minister and to walk tall in EU trump his euroscepticism\n\nDavid Cameron may not have been attending today's EU summit in Brussels as prime minister had he not made a decisive intervention in the 2005 Tory leadership contest.\n\nThe future prime minister started to win over the right when he gave an assurance to the Cornerstone Group that he would pull the Tories out of the main centre right grouping in the European Parliament. *\n\nJohn Hayes, one of the guiding lights in Cornerstone \u2013 dubbed Tombstone by some Cameron supporters \u2013 threw his weight behind Cameron who rewarded him with a ministerial post. Hayes is an ally of Iain Duncan Smith who is playing a leading role in encouraging eurosceptics to put pressure on Cameron.\n\nDavid Davis, the eurosceptic former Europe minister who was Cameron's main rival in 2005, refused to follow his example and give an undertaking to pull out of the European People's Party (EPP). Davis thought that such a clear commitment would close off options.\n\nAnd yet today Davis is lining up with eurosceptics to put pressure on Cameron to table tough demands at the summit. In an article on the ConservativeHome website, Davis writes:\n\nThis is an unprecedented opportunity for the government to establish a new relationship in Europe\u2026What comes out of the EU summit ought to be new terms of membership, with less focus on a legislative union and more focus on free trade, competitiveness and prosperity. They should include an emergency brake and a variable opt out from EU legislation.\n\nSo why is the right \"on manoeuvres\", as one leading figure told me? The extent of the challenge was shown on Wednesday when the Northern Ireland secretary Owen Paterson, whose patron is Duncan Smith, told the Spectator that it was \"inevitable\" that a revision of the Lisbon treaty would require a referendum in Britain.\n\nIt all boils down a simple point. The right no longer trusts the prime minister on Europe because they feel he has fallen into what is regarded as the John Major trap. He sounds suitably eurosceptic and then ends up watering down his promises as he agrees to the compromises that mark every EU negotiation.\n\nThis tendency was identified by Tristan Garel-Jones, the former Conservative Europe. This is what Lord Garel-Jones told me in 2009:\n\nIt is now a tradition in Britain that all the major parties behave badly on Europe in opposition and they all behave fairly sensibly when they get into government. Cameron is a sensible, clever, thoughtful young man. If he becomes prime minister he will behave in a sensible, clever and thoughtful way and in the best interests of Britain.\n\nMost eurosceptics acknowledge that Cameron has had to change tack partly under pressure from the Liberal Democrats. Nick Clegg insisted in the coalition negotiations that the Tories abandon their pledge to repatriate social and employment laws.\n\nIn a compromise the two parties agreed that a referendum would be held on future EU treaties, though only if significant UK powers were transferred to the EU. Duncan Smith started pushing at the boundaries of this on Sunday by saying a referendum should be held simply if a \"major\" treaty is agreed.\n\nOne member of the Cameron circle highlighted the pressure from the Lib Dems by telling me:\n\nThe question for us is which is the bigger force, Germany or the Liberal Democrats?\n\nBut eurosceptics believe there is a deeper reason to explain why the prime minister is not living up to the promise he showed during the 2005 leadership contest. They believe that his innate euroscepticism is trumped by an even greater instinct: to be a successful prime minister who walks tall in Europe.\n\nThe eurosceptics believe that, for once, Ed Miliband was right when he taunted the prime minister in the commons on Wednesday for promising more than he can deliver. Miliband highlighted Cameron's suggestion, shortly before a rebellion in October by 81 Conservative MPs on the EU, that he might use the eurozone crisis to repatriate powers.\n\nThe prime minister had one of his weaker performances at PMQs after Miliband asked:\n\nWhy does the prime minister think it is in the national interest to tell his backbenchers one thing to quell a rebellion on Europe, and to tell his European partners another thing?\n\nCameron thought that his move on the EPP and his track record as a eurosceptic would give him room to manage his party. But once again the EU is coming back to haunt the Tories who lost one prime minister (Margaret Thatcher) over Europe and who found a second (John Major) was hobbled over the issue.\n\nPerhaps the prime minister's chief strategist (George Osborne) might assess whether it is wise to suggest to Tories that he can deliver far more on the EU than he will ever secure. This warning from a eurosceptic, voiced to me after the rebellion in October, stands true:\n\nOn Europe the prime minister can only keep up the tease for so long. At some point the facade crumbles.\n\n* The legacy of Cameron's decision to pull out of the EPP was illustrated today when he did not attend its pre-summit meeting in Marseille attended by Angela Merkel, Nicolas Sarkozy and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso. This gave the prime minister a chance to hold a meeting with the Tories' main allies in Europe \u2013 Poland's opposition. It appears the prime minister did not take up this opportunity.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=David+Cameron%2CEurozone+crisis%2CEuro%2CEuro%2CPolitics%2CAngela+Merkel%2CNicolas+Sarkozy%2CIain+Duncan+Smith%2CDavid+Davis%2CEuropean+Union%2CJohn+Major%2CLiberal-Conservative+coalition%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CNick+Clegg%2CConservatives%2CEd+Miliband%2CMargaret+Thatcher%2CGeorge+Osborne", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2011/12/7/1323269652055/David-Cameron-next-to-Chr-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=85e19453650028bb23af1b3c4ecd1d70", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2011/12/7/1323269652055/David-Cameron-next-to-Chr-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=234ec844a14af764e87cfdbdae7bfb51", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2011/12/7/1323269652055/David-Cameron-next-to-Chr-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=234ec844a14af764e87cfdbdae7bfb51", "date": "08/12/2011"}, "rank_135": {"title": "Clegg defends Cameron's use of veto at EU summit", "text": "The deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, has defended the use of the UK veto to protect the national interest at the EU summit, but said he regretted the breakdown of the talks.\n\nClegg has been working behind the scenes to try to prevent the collapse of the talks, pressing his European partners not to demand a treaty change that might delay a solution, as well as cause problems in the UK among Eurosceptics.\n\nHowever, some of his allies are deeply troubled at the outcome and believe a deal would have been possible if the French had not become so averse to Conservative Euroscepticism. One said: \"This is a total disaster and a setback for everything we fought for. The Eurosceptics have their tails up and will be demanding a referendum to push us out.All Cameron has to do is eat Hungarian goulash.\"\n\nNo 10 said the negotiating strategy had been agreed between Clegg and Cameron before the summit, and there had been a further discussion between the two men on Friday morning.\n\nScotching any suggestion that the coalition might be threatened by Cameron's negotiating tactics, Clegg said: \"I have said for months that it would be best to avoid arcane debates about treaty change altogether and if we had to proceed down that road, it would be best to do so in a way that did not create divisions in Europe.\n\n\"The demands Britain made for safeguards, on which the coalition government was united, were modest and reasonable. They were safeguards for the single market, not just the UK. There were no demands of repatriation of powers from the EU to Britain and no demands for a unilateral carve-out of UK financial services.\n\n\"What we sought to ensure was to maintain a level playing field in financial services and the single market as a whole. This would have retained the UK's ability to take tougher, not looser, regulatory action to sort out our banking system.\"\n\nBritain had been arguing for the right to strengthen UK banks' capital ratios in line with the Vickers commission report. But Liberal Democrat sources insisted they had not been seeking to repatriate powers.\n\nVince Cable, the business secretary, said it would take time to digest the implications for the EU in terms of treaty change. He said the really important thing about the summit was that the eurozone sorted out its very deep financial crisis because hundreds of thousands of British jobs depended on it. \"We will see that over the next few days. The key national interest we are trying to protect here is the single market which very large numbers of jobs depend on it. We have a critical interest in protecting the single market, keeping it open and enlarging it. That is what the argument is about.\"\n\nBut his close ally Lord Oakeshott, the senior Liberal Democrat peer, took a different view and may be projecting other aspects of Cable's thinking. He accused Cameron of undermining Britain's influence in Europe and putting the interests of the City above the wider economy.\n\nHe said: \"It is a black day for Britain and Europe. We are now in the waiting room while critical decisions are being taken.\n\n\"By pulling out of the main centre-right grouping in Europe and linking up with the wackos and weirdos in eastern Europe instead, David Cameron has seriously undermined Britain's influence.\n\n\"With the western economies and our banking system on the edge of a cliff, we should not be putting special pleading for special interests in the City of London above our vital national interest of working closely together with Germany and France to keep our economy and jobs all over Britain safe.\"\n\nOther senior Liberal Democrats fear that the City of London will be less enthusiastic if it ends up being isolated and kept out of the key discussions on the future of the single market.\n\nMartin Horwood, Lib Dem MP for Cheltenham, blamed Tory Euroscepticism for leaving the UK facing a \"worst-case scenario\" of isolation in Europe.\n\nHe welcomed progress towards a deal to rescue the single currency but said it was not \"the ideal outcome from a Liberal Democrat point of view. It will make it more difficult for us to exercise the kind of influence that we all want over the future of the European single market and the future of the European economy, of which we are a part,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\nChris Davies, a Liberal Democrat MEP, accused Cameron of \"betraying\" Britain. \"Far from keeping Britain strong, Cameron has ensured that we will lose our influence at the top table,\" said Davies.\n\n\"By seeking to protect bankers from regulation, he has betrayed Britain's real interests and done nothing in practice to help the City of London. The fear now must be that we will increasingly lose the opportunity to affect decisions being taken that are bound to affect us. The consequence of the xenophobic attitudes towards our European neighbours that have been allowed to develop has been to leave Britain weak. We have shot ourselves in the foot.\"\n\nAndrew Duff, Lib Dem MEP for the East of England, tweeted: \"Cameron is to be warmly congratulated on reaching his goal of second-class membership of the EU.\"\n\nSir Menzies Campbell, Clegg's predecessor as Lib Dem leader, said the outcome had been \"inevitable\" but cautioned that important details of the deal needed to be thrashed out.\n\n\"If the attitude of the French was as, for example, exemplified by the statement made by President Sarkozy, then I do not think David Cameron had any alternative. It's important to remember that the purpose of this summit has been to resolve the crisis in the eurozone. It is also important to remember that there are people, and indeed countries, outside who regard that as being very significant \u2013 President Obama for example.\"", "images": ["https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Eurozone+crisis%2CNick+Clegg%2CDavid+Cameron%2CEuropean+Union%2CLiberal-Conservative+coalition%2CConservatives%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CPolitics%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/eada8aa27c12fe2d5afa3a89d3fbae0d/fallback-logo.png", "date": "09/12/2011"}, "rank_224": {"title": "What has Europe ever done for us?", "text": "Together with five other leading newspapers from across the continent, we examine the EU's strengths and weaknesses\n\nThe European Union is grappling with its deepest crisis in 60 years, a malaise that goes beyond the euro debacle and the enormous tide of debt swamping the continent.

But suspicion towards the European project has existed for longer within the British mainstream than anywhere else. It was evident in the lofty mistrust displayed by both Labour and Tory governments towards the EU's first faltering steps. At the signature of the treaty of Rome in 1957, Britain sent Russell Bretherton, a middling trade official, not even a minister. To observe, not join.\n\nWhen the then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, acknowledged the strategic error and applied to join in 1961, his wartime ally, Charles de Gaulle, feared Britain would be an Anglo-Saxon Trojan horse and kept it out until 1973. In those early days it was Labour's leader, Hugh Gaitskell, who raised the Eurosceptic standard against losing \"1,000 years of history\" as an independent state. His enemies on the Labour left, who saw Europe as a capitalist ramp, cheered him on. Fellow moderates were appalled.\n\nThe Tories had their sceptics too \u2013 including pro-Commonwealth nostalgics \u2013 preaching the angry language of betrayal. They were marginalised, their rebellious votes neutralised by Europhile Labour and Liberal (later Lib Dem) MPs, as well as most of Fleet Street where \u2013 as at Westminster \u2013 most top jobs were held by \"never again\" veterans of the second world war.\n\nWith the exceptions of the pro-empire Daily Express and the communist Morning Star, Fleet Street voted yes in the 1975 referendum on UK membership. Seven Labour cabinet members \u2013 led by Michael Foot \u2013 were allowed to campaign for a no. Margaret Thatcher campaigned for a yes with Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, David Steel and Roy Jenkins.\n\nOnly in the late 80s, as vivid wartime memories faded, did the centre of gravity shift in both main parties. Claiming to have been deceived, in 1988 Thatcher denounced \"federalism\" in Bruges, just as Neil Kinnock \u2013 encouraged by the visionary French European Commission president, Jacques Delors \u2013 led Labour to embrace a social Europe. It would protect workers against the free market capitalism of Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. As Labour swung towards Europe, most of Fleet Street swung the other way. So it has remained.\n\nWhy did this happen in Britain more than elsewhere? Deep-seated history, geography, law and intellectual traditions and (much under-remarked) religion, played their parts. All contributed to a distinctive strand of European culture, sometimes integrated (400 years of Roman rule) but often semi-detached: \"Fog In Channel, Continent Isolated,\" as a headline once put it.\n\nIt had been so since rising ice-melt waters of the North Sea broke through the chalk bridge that once linked Dover to Calais. It took another 8,500 years before Thatcher's Channel tunnel (an irony also under-remarked) rejoined them.\n\nIn consequence, the English language developed as a hybrid one, neither Germanic nor Latin. Pragmatic common law traditions, later exported throughout the English-speaking world, were different from codified Roman law. Henry VIII's Tudor Church of England was neither Catholic nor Calvinist, but nationalist and individualistic.\n\nSpared the traumas of foreign occupation or endless wars fought on home territory (25 of the 27 EU member states, all but the UK and Sweden, were occupied by foreign armies and/or domestic dictators in the 20th century), England's political liberties prospered, even if its economic and intellectual development often lagged behind continental neighbours.\n\nA stable national state (England had not yet morphed into Britain) fostered a cocky sense of \"sceptred isle\" exceptionalism so evident in Shakespeare's histories and Elizabeth I's bold seafarers, savage pirates and Protestant terrorists as Spaniards saw them. The new British state, a maritime trading nation since prehistoric times, now fashioned growing naval and industrial power into a world empire that sealed an often arrogant self-regard, global but also insular.\n\nNot even economic collapse-disguised-as-victory after 1945 could dispel cold war illusions of \"Big Three\" status. Britain's role, up there with the US and USSR, was to be sustained by its three circles of influence: the US special relationship; the UN security council; and the Commonwealth. Who needed Europe, eh?\n\nSuch gut Euroscepticism has been evident elsewhere in the cool Protestant North; in Norway, which (worried about its fish) vote no to joining; in Iceland (which never applied); in Denmark and Sweden, which both rejected the euro, successful social democratic states that maintained a degree of detachment from the dominant European \"Rhineland\" model of modernisation. But they were the exceptions in the decades when \"joining Europe\" was the modernising ambition of states as different as Turkey, Portugal and former Soviet satellites.At this point Britain took another distinctive turn.\n\nUnder Thatcher and Reagan, Anglo-Saxon capitalism lurched away from the post-war social democratic consensus towards free markets and free trade. It was exactly what many continental mercantilists \u2013 more inclined to managed and protected markets and Catholic \"social solidarity\" \u2013 instinctively mistrusted. It was why much of the British left, once dogmatically anti-European, swung the other way with equal fervour precisely because it now seemed to offer more security to ordinary people.\n\nYet soft pro-European rhetoric from Tony Blair in the New Labour years could never reverse Thatcher's \"betrayal\" cry at Bruges, just two years after she had signed the 1986 Single European Act, which had abolished so many national vetoes that impeded the single market. And two years later, just weeks before she was ousted by her own party, a weakened Thatcher was forced to take sterling into the embryo-euro, the ERM.\n\nBy the time it was ejected and the architect of the policy, John Major, was humiliated in 1992, Euroscepticism was rampant in the Tory ranks, with Thatcher its unofficial champion.\n\nBy now the \"sceptical\" language was becoming harsher, a scapegoat for disappointment, party faction-fighting (Thatcher's assassin, Michael Heseltine, had been a pro-EU cheer-leader) and ever-harsher economic realities. Asia's return to the top table after 500 years of subservience to Europe was only slowly being understood. Louder than ever, it was said that, back in 1973, Britain had been tricked by Heath into joining what was presented as a trading block but was really an embryo-superstate, a corrupt one too. The EU wanted to control our courts, our armed forces, our fishing fleets and farmers. Brussels was bureaucratic and increasingly arrogant.\n\nEarnestly and cautiously, EU national leaders tried to build an unprecedented political entity, a series of structures \u2013 some inter-governmental, others integrated \u2013 that could compete with the US and China. For their pains they were accused of rushing so fast that they left voters behind them, the \"democratic deficit\" of an arrogant EU elite.\n\nTory-led Britain had fought for an enlarged EU \u2013 \"wider, not deeper\" -and got its way as ex-Soviet states joined. London won its opt-out from the single currency project at Maastricht in 1991, and commitments to economic reform on more competitive, Anglo-Saxon lines. But \"Euroscepticism\" \u2013 by now largely the property of the populist right \u2013 was not so easily appeased. The pro-Europeans were technocratic and rational, their opponents used the stirring language of independence and liberty.\n\nThe appearance of one-policy parties such as the UK Independence party pulled the Tory mainstream further away from the idea of Europe. David Cameron clinched his leadership bid in 2005 by promising to leave the EU-conservative block at Strasbourg and form a less \"federalist\" group. His consequent isolation contributed to last December's summit veto in Brussels, a sceptics' triumph that may proved short-lived.\n\nFor many the sovereign euro crisis that has followed the bank bust of 2007-09 served only to prove the arrogant folly of Europe's leaders.\n\nEurosceptics were happier to blame failures of state regulation than the market-driven greed and irresponsibility of bankers, whose sparkling promise of easy money they preferred to the dour language of Brussels bureaucrats.\n\nIt was a perfect storm, decades in the making, as EU skies darkened and the thunder grew louder. By now 90s Euro-optimism had given way to Euroscepticism across the continent, from Finland and Austria to jobless young workers trying to leave Spain and Portugal. Even in loyal founder states \u2013 the Netherlands, France, Germany itself \u2013 Euroscepticism and xenophobic parties were again on the rise.\n\nEuroscepticism had proved to be one of Britain's more successful exports through the Channel tunnel.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 1 February 2012 to correct a line saying the Daily Worker opposed a yes vote in the 1975 UK referendum on EEC membership.

The last Eurobarometer opinion poll shows 62% of Spaniards \"tend to distrust\" the EU, against 30% who \"tend to trust\" it. Spanish distrust has now risen above the levels in France or Germany, though it has yet to reach the traditional Euroscepticism of Britain or the new-found wariness of troubled Greece.\n\nSpain's political elites have done nothing directly to encourage this sudden change. The previous socialist government did not even admit its changed economic policies were linked to EU pressure. Officially, the main parties on both the right and left are Europhile. No leading Socialist or member of the People's party (PP) has raised their voice against the EU. Nor have any leading nationalists in Catalonia or the Basque country. They believe the EU provides a better framework for their aspirations than the Spanish state.\n\nBut Spaniards are poorly informed. After years as a country that receives more than it gives to EU funds, a November 2009 poll by CIS (Centre for Social Investigation) found only 26% knew that Spain was a net receiver. A higher percentage mistakenly believed it was a net donor.\n\nThe groups who trust the EU most are the better-educated professionals, higher earners and young people. Distrust is highest among elderly people, those with less education, unemployed people, pensioners and those who have trouble paying their monthly bills.\n\nTrust is also higher among those who see globalisation as an opportunity, who also tend to come from the higher social and economic classes. Those who see the national economy in optimistic terms, admittedly a minority in Spain, are also trusters.\n\nSpain's EU entry came with hopes that it would help bolster freedoms and reduce economic and social differences. And that is what happened. But now 67% of Spaniards believe things are going in the wrong direction inside the EU, against only 13% who believe they are going right.\n\nDespite all this, it is still early to declare Spain a Eurosceptic country. Even though public support has fallen dramatically (in October 2010, for example, three out of four Spaniards had a good or very good opinion of the EU, according to the Latinobar\u00f3metro), other figures show a country seeking European solutions. Six out of 10 Spaniards agree, for example, that EU membership has been good for their country and that it is best to stay in, even if those percentages are falling.\n\nThere is room for confidence: 74% of Spaniards think Europe urgently needs a government with sufficient powers to unify and co-ordinate the actions of the 27 member states, according to a Metroscopia poll from January 2012. That seems clear backing for the recent Brussels agreement that Britain opted out of.\n\nThis is not a task that Mariano Rajoy's PP government can carry out alone, but public opinion points to the way forward \u2013 which is to work towards exactly that kind of joint government. Apart from the problems of achieving that, another major test awaits: finding out whether people are really aware enough of the price to be paid in terms of national policies that will be conditioned by higher powers inside the EU framework or in the directorate that is set up at its heart.\n\nJoaqu\u00edn Prieto writes for el Pa\u00eds", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327579414991/A-march-to-protest-agains-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=df94f21bb78307f596d9d16e50ad20c9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/1/25/1327495573115/Angela-Merkel-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5faa6ad3ac573bdb494c8bcb82c67e65", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/25/1327484372108/Angela-Merkel-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d55c47fc02afb2c49a9ff50dc3c78231", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327579414991/A-march-to-protest-agains-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d59c87d66e7227716f3007b66cdc2aa1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/26/1327578600773/The-European-Central-Bank-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=61f11617beb40ce53dd6e1474d735562", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CSpain%2CEurope%2CWorld+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/26/1327581741182/Umberto-Eco-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=122c8a93cf404fb0dcaf81b722d15162", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327579414991/A-march-to-protest-agains-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d59c87d66e7227716f3007b66cdc2aa1", "date": "26/01/2012"}, "rank_274": {"title": "Debt crisis hardens Eurosceptics' antipathy in Poland", "text": "In Poland, Euroscepticism is the preserve of the conservative Law and Justice party, and its leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczynski.

In a crowded room, she addresses the rank and file. She whips up the room, denouncing \"the Europe of Brussels\" and espousing protectionism, border control and a withdrawal from the euro. The 700 people present raise the roof.\n\nFast forward a year and the presidential candidate is at it again. Le Pen has not diluted her message. The Europe that grew from the foundations of the 1957 Treaty of Rome must go. Euroscepticism, even Europhobia, is one of the fundamentals of the far right. Its voters reject the European project, synonymous for them with social breakdown and dislocation.\n\nThe far right is not alone in this. Several parties and figures on the left also oppose, for very different reasons, the process of European integration. But it was the National Front that claimed much of the kudos, for example, when France rejected the European constitutional treaty in a 2005 referendum.\n\nFor the National Front, the European Union is the other face of the globalisation coin, responsible for unemployment, immigration and insecurity.\n\nIt is a paradox that Le Pen's original political platform was as \u2026 a Euro MP. She was elected under the slogan \"Europe hurts\". She even gave up her role as local councillor for the H\u00e9nin-Beaumont region in order to be able to serve in the European parliament.\n\nLe Pen's pitch is this: that in order to go back to the idea of a strong, interventionist state, France must leave the EU.\n\n\"We will have to strike down the European treaties, the treaties of the mainstream parties, which are holding us back and condemning us to isolation. This anything-goes politics has become totally anachronistic throughout the world,\" she said earlier this month.\n\nLe Pen is not scared of outspoken, even contradictory utterances on this issue. She is perfectly capable of dubbing the EU \"the Trojan horse of ultraliberal globalisation\" at the same time as comparing it to the USSR and referring to \"a European Soviet Union\".\n\nAnd when one of her interlocutors raised the legal difficulties involved with pulling out of the EU, Le Pen had a reply of a similar tone. For her, the EU \"is a bit like communism, it's totalitarian. We've been told for years that we can't leave.\"\n\nIn frontist parlance, the EU has been built \"against\" and \"without\" the European people. The far right sees the idea of a European culture as being not legal nor political in essence, but civilisational, based on a Judeo-Christian heritage.\n\nLe Pen also knows that politics is about symbols. Thus one of her proposals is to ban the raising of the European flag on public buildings: \"When I say that public buildings should always, in all parts of the country, carry the tricolor and that the European flag should be banned, I am showing our unswerving attachment to our national flag. And that this shocks people merely reinforces my conviction.\"\n\nAbel Mestre writes for le Monde", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327575425563/Marine-Le-Pen-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2338313ea1942ce4191a683f6b97be64", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Marine+Le+Pen%2CEuropean+Union%2CFrance%2CEurope%2CWorld+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327575425563/Marine-Le-Pen-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=365bf837cc3303d6d8bd750c1d01aa9d"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327575425563/Marine-Le-Pen-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2338313ea1942ce4191a683f6b97be64", "date": "26/01/2012"}, "rank_296": {"title": "Italy's Northern League: Eurosceptics with their own pan-European project", "text": "At the beginning of last December, the Northern League \u2013 having left the majority that supported the government \u2013 convened in Vicenza for what it called \"the Northern parliament\". Its leader, Umberto Bossi, then announced its new political policy. Its aim is no less than to alter the geography of Europe.\n\nBossi unveiled a great map, coloured in by his son Renzo, that signalled the birth of a new state composed of so-called Padania (that is, the regions of Northern Italy), Switzerland, Austria, Bavaria and Savoy. Soon afterwards, to confirm the \"seriousness\" of the programme, the former minister Roberto Calderoli said that, from now on, all members of the Northern League, when they renewed their party membership, would have to swear solemnly to fight for the secession of Padania.\n\nIt is not the first time, of course, that the League has spoken of secession: this has, in fact, always been its final objective, or at least its dream. However, never before has it spoken of changing not only the borders of Italy, but also of other states such as France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n\nThe move might sound pan-European, but the league's members are about as far as you can get from European integrationists. They have made much of their Euroscepticism over the years, and are finding now they are at the vanguard of a growing movement that encompasses much of the centre right in Italy. Italian Euroscepticism has been boosted by gathering hostility towards the single currency, which is considered to be responsible for the economic crisis; and it is particularly resentful of the most powerful European states, who are believed to be the real rulers of a union in which Italy plays the part of poor relation or even colony.\n\nIn support of his new policy, Bossi explained that a war had been fought in Europe \u2013 monetary and non-military, but nevertheless a war \u2013 and Italy had lost. And when wars end, he added, treaties are written and borders are changed.\n\nHow credible is a policy of this nature? In Italy, it is considered a farce, and it is possible that reactions from abroad have been even harsher: come on, just imagine how the Germans, the French, the Swiss and the Austrians would react to news that a man going by the name of Umberto Bossi wants to take over their countries.\n\nNevertheless, putting this to one side, it would be a mistake to dismiss it all as a mere pipe-dream. The League may be full of big talk, but it knows it can take advantage of the deeply rooted opinions of a substantial proportion of the population of northern Italy. The sacrifices Mario Monti's government has asked Italians to make for the sake of stability are certainly strengthening this intolerance towards the EU.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Italy%2CEurope%2CEuropean+Union%2CWorld+news%2CThe+League", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327579414991/A-march-to-protest-agains-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=df94f21bb78307f596d9d16e50ad20c9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/1/25/1327495573115/Angela-Merkel-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5faa6ad3ac573bdb494c8bcb82c67e65", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327577102111/Umberto-Bossi-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7016a5d4514a72eb1a8ff50061d8711", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/25/1327484372108/Angela-Merkel-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d55c47fc02afb2c49a9ff50dc3c78231", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/26/1327581741182/Umberto-Eco-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=122c8a93cf404fb0dcaf81b722d15162", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327577102111/Umberto-Bossi-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5a35a24caa3b9eb22cb7c0417b1bdb45", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327577102111/Umberto-Bossi-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e7016a5d4514a72eb1a8ff50061d8711", "date": "26/01/2012"}, "rank_282": {"title": "Germany's Euro-rebels rally against rapid integration", "text": "It was a cold day in 1998 when four men went by foot to the German constitutional court in the city of Karlsruhe to rescue the Deutschmark. Their bid failed \u2013 but a standard operating procedure for German Euroscepticism was born.\n\nSince then, Germany's pre-eminent court has been repeatedly petitioned by a mix of lawyers, economists and financial experts alarmed at the gathering pace of European integration. Their judgments have been nuanced. Apart from a half-victory for the eurosceptics in 2009, the judges have generally ruled against the petitioners. But their rulings have made it clear that they expect European integration to be properly democratic, sanctioned by the \"clear will of the German people\".\n\nAmong those early complainants in 1998 were Joachim Starbatty, professor of political economics at T\u00fcbingen University, and Karl Albrecht Schachtschneider, a law professor from Erlangen. In their briefcase they had a 352-page writ railing against the introduction of a common European currency.\n\nLess than three months later they were sent packing. The constitutional court in Karlsruhe didn't want to stand in the way of the common currency. Nevertheless, the seeds of an anti-euro cell were sown \u2013 a cell which was set to criticise ever more sharply the European policy of the federal government. Their favoured weapon: bringing lawsuits in Karlsruhe.\n\nSchachtschneider had form on this front. As early as 1993 he had already fought against the Maastricht treaty in the highest court in Germany. He didn't win. But the judgment from Karlsruhe was set to cause serious headaches for the German government further down the line, raising an important question: would the constitutional court one day stop the train hurtling towards European integration?\n\nThough the judges rejected Schachtschneider's claim, they issued in their judgment a reminder that the European unification process should be anchored in democracy. They also reserved the right to have the final say on European matters, bequeathing German citizens an extremely generous right to go to court on EU matters.\n\nThe Euro-rebels saw this as an invitation. When the EU was trying to take the next step towards integration with the Lisbon treaty in 2009, these men brought another case to Karlsruhe. This time with a different lineup. Starbatty was still there, but at his side was now Dieter Spethmann, another representative of the old West Germany \u2013 he was head of the steel company Thyssen. With them was Franz Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, the son of the resistance fighter who was shot by the Nazis after plotting to kill Hitler in 1944.\n\nThe lawyer among them, the ever resourceful Markus C Kerber, probably came up with the abstruse idea of supporting their case by quoting the right to resistance. But it was arguments advanced by a certain Peter Gauweiler who gave the court pause for thought.\n\nA master populist, this politician had carved out a name for himself as a maverick in the CSU, the Bavarian sister party to Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, and had made EU scepticism his party piece. He found a congenial partner in the Freiburg lawyer Dietrich Murswiek. It was his contribution which brought a half-victory for the Euro-sceptics in the judgment on the Lisbon treaty in 2009. The national parliament was again given the right to have its say, but above all, the court drew a line in the sand marking the boundaries of European integration, which could only be crossed with the \"clear will of the German people\".\n\nTwo years later, in 2011, the rebels found themselves once again in Karlsruhe, this time bringing a case against the euro bailout. In this judgment, the court said that the budgetary decision-making must remain democratically anchored \u2013 which meant the Bundestag would always retain the last word on questions of gigantic financial liabilities. Here, once again, it was Murswiek who enjoyed the most attention from the judges.\n\nOne can ascertain from the Karlsruhe judgments a reticence towards the desire for brisk integration that reigns in Brussels.\n\nUltimately, the judgments combine to make a particularly peculiar melange: among the plaintiffs there is a mix of economic pessimism and insecure nationalism with a shot of nostalgia for the Deutschmark.\n\nIn the court itself, the worry dominates that democracy could be diluted into nothing in Europe. This concern is genuine and is no doubt bundled up with another fear: that the Karlsruhe court would have even less of a say, the further the integration progresses.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/26/1327579414991/A-march-to-protest-agains-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=df94f21bb78307f596d9d16e50ad20c9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/1/25/1327495573115/Angela-Merkel-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5faa6ad3ac573bdb494c8bcb82c67e65", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/25/1327484372108/Angela-Merkel-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d55c47fc02afb2c49a9ff50dc3c78231", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/26/1327578600773/The-European-Central-Bank-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=da961d612864fae5c21f42d2291d8de7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/26/1327578600773/The-European-Central-Bank-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=61f11617beb40ce53dd6e1474d735562", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/26/1327581741182/Umberto-Eco-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=122c8a93cf404fb0dcaf81b722d15162", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Germany%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CEuro%2CEuro%2CBusiness", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/1/26/1327578600773/The-European-Central-Bank-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=da961d612864fae5c21f42d2291d8de7", "date": "26/01/2012"}, "rank_304": {"title": "Finland looks down across eurozone with mix of pride and anxiety", "text": "Finland should be feeling on top of the world. Twenty years after a desperate banking crisis sparked a deep recession, this most northerly member of the eurozone was hailed on Wednesday as an example to follow by Mario Monti, Italy's prime minister.\n\nThe country punches above its weight in negotiations over bailouts for weaker members of the currency union, demanding special collateral deals in return for Finnish approval. It stands distinctively in the eurozone, having the best Moody's credit rating \u2013 the only one worthy of AAA \u2013 with a stable outlook. But beneath this rosy picture, concern over the future is bubbling among the more than 5 million people who live within Finland's 130,000 square miles of land.\n\nVesa Puttonen, a professor at Aalto University, in Helsinki, regards Moody's praise as a distinctly mixed blessing and compares Finland to a star performer in a failing school. \"We're the model pupil in the classroom, but the class is doing really badly,\" he said, pointing out that Finland's current account was now in deficit for the first time since the dark days of the early 1990s, and that it was lagging behind Sweden, the big brother over the border who kept out of the euro, on several other measures, too.\n\n\"Some of the economic fundamentals are going south,\" said Puttonen, warning that Moody's blessing could be a curse if it prevented the Finnish public thinking about pressing issues such as whether to raise the retirement age. \"We lack a sense of urgency in Finland to deal with our problems.\"\n\nFinland \u2013 its most famous son is the composer Jean Sibelius \u2013 has not always taken a harmonious approach to the eurozone since the crisis began. Demands for collateral \u2013 protection against Finnish losses if a bailout failed \u2013 were an extra hurdle during the talks over Greece's second aid deal, although Moody's applauded the policy. And the noise generated by the eurosceptic True Finns party has fuelled speculation that the country could look for an exit door from the euro.\n\nFor Finns, though, the tough stance simply reflects disappointment that many members of the currency union it joined enthusiastically in 1999 have proved somewhat fickle. As Jyrki Katainen, the prime minister, put it this week, for Finns, rules are rules, not a starting point for \"creative interpretation\".\n\nPuttonen agreed. \"We are honest, contract trusting, people. That's good, but it easily happens that we can be cheated by other people who do things differently.\" And the repeated talk of \"lazy southern Europeans\" is beginning to grate. \"We feel we are in the wrong club, and we are,\" Puttonen said.\n\nVisitors to Helsinki were treated to a dose of decent summer weather this week. But at Kauppatori, the market square on the eastern edge of the capital, there were signs that the euro crisis storm clouds were casting a shadow.\n\n\"We've been here 20 years, and business is the worst it's ever been,\" said Iiri Rapp, from behind a stall selling rugs, baseball caps, fluffy toys, flags, and T-shirts to tourists. Rapp said that traditionally her best customers, Italians and Parisians, had all but vanished. She blamed the euro crisis, and was pinning her hopes for prosperity on things spinning out of control. \"We're hoping they blow up the whole euro,\" Rapp said. However, she did not believe Finland should just go it alone.\n\nKauppatori is next to Helsinki's South Harbour, where barges carrying holidaymakers nip around much larger ferries going overseas. Across the square, Hannu Leskinen, another stallholder, argued that Finland had to remain in the euro because of its small size.\n\n\"People are very angry about the cost of the bailouts. But there's no point in stopping being a member, even though Italy may be next,\" Leskinen said.\n\nFinland won independence only in 1917 after 100 years under the Russian thumb; for 500 years before that it was a Swedish territory. Dominated by its bigger neighbours through history, it fought the Soviet Union (twice) and Germany during the second world war.\n\nAs Jan von Gerich, a global fixed income strategist for Nordea, a financial services group, pointed out, Finland's commitment to doing the right thing meant it was the only country to meet its reparations bill after the war.\n\n\"We obey treaties. That is part of our culture,\" he said.\n\nAfter tiptoeing around Russian sensibilities during the cold war, taking a neutral position on key issues, Finland was plunged into deep recession once the Soviet system collapsed.\n\nAfter slashing spending and devaluing its currency, Finland returned to growth and was admitted to the EU in 1995, the year it also enjoyed one of its greatest sporting triumphs, beating Sweden in the final of the ice hockey world championships in Stockholm (imagine England winning the football World Cup for the first time in a German stadium).\n\nOver the past 15 years the mobile phone company Nokia has come to symbolise the power of modern Finland. But domestic pride has taken a knock recently following Nokia hitting trouble; last week came the announcement that the firm's last remaining Finnish factory would close.\n\n\"We used to think of ourselves as Nokialand. But now Nokia is struggling, and we're not so proud of Nokia, after all,\" said Puttonen.\n\nVon Gerich at Nordea said Finland needed to develop new businesses to fill the hole left by Nokia and by the decline of traditional industries such as timber.\n\n\"People are desperately looking for new successes like Nokia, but I believe we need several small successes rather than one huge one.\"\n\nDespite these problems, daily life in Helsinki appears very agreeable. In a central square which would be perfect for mass daily protests if relocated to Athens, a Latvian R&B band called \u010cehols was attracting a decent crowd, respectable tips and CD sales.\n\nThe lead singer said the group had come over from Riga, and appreciated being funded in euros after \"40 kg\" of loose change during a trip to Stockholm proved hard to deal with.\n\nThe group also had little time for talk of the euro crisis. \"We're artists, we don't worry about that,\" said the drummer. Too cool for koulu, as they might say round here.\n\nOver at Hotel K\u00e4mp, just a few well-drilled puck shots away, crowds swarmed this week for a glimpse of Bruce Springsteen, who was in town for a concert. One tourist, who had travelled almost 250 miles (400km) from the town of Kuopio to visit Helsinki, said she was starting to fret about the eurozone, but was convinced Finland should remain in it. \"I am a little bit worried, because now so many countries are in little crises.\"\n\nBut mention the words \"eurozone crisis\" to other Finns, and you could be rewarded with little more than a confused, albeit friendly, smile. Von Gerich believed there was no chance of Finland leaving the eurozone in the short term but said vocal criticism of the single currency would increase. \"We might reach the point soon where an opposition party calls for Finland to leave the euro. It will get livelier.\"\n\nFor Elina, a 20-year-old waiter, keeping the coffee and croissants flowing at Kauppatori was a more pressing concern than fretting about the euro. She admitted, though, that some of her friends were a little worried about the situation.\n\nAnd with reason. Although Finland is one of the few eurozone countries that have managed to drag its youth unemployment rate down recently, more than 17% of under-25s are still officially out of work.\n\nStroll through Helsinki and you can find some of those young people pounding the streets.

The union is currently reviled perhaps like never before: a euro debacle, debt swamping the continent, expansion stalled, sluggish economies going backwards, euroscepticism on the rise. But what of the European success stories? What about trade, movement of people, prosperity, environmental law? What about social programmes, collective heft and \u2013 as the Nobel prize committee pointed out \u2013 the advent of peace in a part of the world that had been blighted by cataclysmic war every couple of generations?\n\nA team of reporters for the Europa project fanned out to find out what the EU did well. There is the single market, which our report argued \"has made goods cheaper, labour cheaper, and trade more secure and more competitive. The knock-on effects are felt across the economy, from the jobs created and the cheaper costs of manpower to foreign direct investment that pours in from countries enticed by getting a foothold in the world's richest consumer market.\"\n\nThere are the cross-border businesses that find it easier to operate in a single economic space. There is the free movement of people that has made life easier for border inhabitants and created job opportunities everywhere \u2013 and not just for highly paid footballers. There are the social transfers that provide safety nets where national governments have none. \"I don't think our foundation could continue to exist unless we had those sources of EU money,\" one British programme director told us.\n\nThere are green spaces, protected largely by EU directives \u2013 although the report card is less glowing when it comes to agriculture and fisheries. The eurozone has its problems of imbalance, productivity, growth, debt and unemployment, certainly.

Instead, he is now in prison after being returned to face justice \u2013 under the EAW. A withdrawal from the EAW, as a result of the Conservative obsession to limit Britain's partnership and co-operation in the EU, would be welcomed by all transnational criminals who flee British justice and rely on other countries' legal systems to delay the return of any fugitive to British justice.\n\nOther measures to promote justice and co-operation against criminals who pay no attention to European frontiers are also being thrown out of the window as May enters the cabinet \"EU exit competition\" \u2013 apparently to see which minister can parade his or her dislike of the EU the most.\n\nThe following scenario looks likely: co-operation on sharing databases and research, and EU funding for crime-fighting initiatives, will all go out the window. Joint work to control immigration will be abolished. The Brits who currently head Europol and Eurojust \u2013 two useful co-ordinating bodies where Britain needs a voice \u2013 will now have to resign. Britain will now have to negotiate one by one with each EU member state on bilateral policies on crime fighting or immigration control.\n\nAs Tory MEP Timothy Kirkhope points out, the rest of Europe will see the British decision as just another victory for Ukip, Tory MPs who want to quit the EU and offshore-owned press with its Europhobic pathologies.\n\nInstead, Britain should be in there arguing for improvement and reform. There are problems with the implementation of the EAW and it may need amending so is only covers more serious crimes with longer penalties than at present. But given the long delays in bringing some criminals to justice in the UK or the failure to secure rape convictions, Britain is in no position to boast that British judicial procedures are perfect.\n\nMay could well argue that Britain can keep using the warrant. But that assumes the other 26 EU member states will allow Britain to cherrypick which bits of EU crime-fighting Tory ministers like. And in any case, the EAW has come under sustained fire from Tory MPs, headed by Dominic Raab, who say it allows British citizens to be extradited unfairly and costs Britain millions to administer.\n\nMay's announcement is driven by dislike of Europe, more than a rational analysis of the balance of advantage to Britain in combating trafficking and other cross-border crime. It is unclear why other EU member states who have to accept the whole EU crime and justice package will be willing to allow Britain to pick and choose different parts of it.\n\nThe European public prosecutor, which is proposed under this scheme, would prosecute European-level financial crime, counterfeiting and fraud but do so in relevant national courts. Opting out of this will please those fraudsters who have given the City a bad name, but it is hard to see why Britain should oppose European-level investigation and prosecution of financial crime.\n\nFor comparison, Norway co-operates with the EAW \u2013 just as Norway implements more EU directives than Britain. Given that Tory Eurosceptics claim they want a Norwegian status for Britain in terms of detaching ourselves from the EU, they do not seem to realise that both Norway and Switzerland are in the Schengen area and abide by most EU rules.\n\nBefore the EAW, Britain protected for 10 years Rachid Ramda, the Islamist terrorist who was the mastermind behind the 1995 Paris metro bombings which killed eight and wounded 80 in a pre-echo of 7/7 in London. Ramda was arrested in London on the basis of very clear evidence from the French police. But without an EAW he was able \u2013 with the help of lawyers and judges as well as Liberty and the Home Office \u2013 to stay in London for 10 years. Finally, Charles Clarke, who was home secretary after 7/7 changed attitudes, sent him back in 2005 to face justice and the victims of his killings. He is now serving life in a French prison.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350305181743/Theresa-May-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e78d6cdee8bd388f18860c2da88637fa", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350294708883/Theresa-May-MP-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cbdb66024870e702ea686022a60f371e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350320850697/Theresa-May-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6fa8d8b7e97f553507e75013593dd5c5", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+arrest+warrant%2CLaw%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CPolice%2CUK+news%2CCrime%2CTheresa+May%2CPolitics%2CConservatives%2CWorld+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/14/1350246975922/Theresa-May-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=280ce82610cf68288b623be6c660919d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350294708883/Theresa-May-MP-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9343370b8d9d6046b924a164357f3f2a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/15/1350294708883/Theresa-May-MP-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cbdb66024870e702ea686022a60f371e", "date": "15/10/2012"}, "rank_78": {"title": "Tories bow to European court of human rights over prisoner voting rights", "text": "The government is planning a draft bill introducing limited prisoner voting rights to comply with the European court of human rights, despite fierce opposition from Eurosceptic backbenchers.\n\nBut embarrassed government ministers are likely to defer the hugely controversial announcement until just before a late-November deadline, allowing it to be made after the police commissioner elections on 17 November.\n\nOne government source said: \"No party wants to put this in their 'last week grid' for these elections. The final decision will be made very late.\"\n\nThe announcement is still causing friction, with one coalition source saying most of the dispute is now \"a blue-on-blue row\", within the Conservative party.\n\nDavid Cameron has said it would make him sick to give prisoners the right to vote, but he allowed the then Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper to propose that prisoners serving a sentence of four years or less should be given the right.\n\nHarder-line Tory backbenchers, such as Dominic Raab, have argued there is practically no danger of a fine by the European court should Britain not introduce votes for prisoners, and absolutely no chance of the UK being kicked out of the Council of Europe. But the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, has told ministers they have to accept the ruling of the European court in Strasbourg after repeated appeals have failed. Grieve has been an exponent of reform of the court, but not UK withdrawal, saying that would make Britain a pariah state.\n\nLiberal Democrat ministers still support compliance with the court, but do not want to be seen any longer to be in the vanguard on an issue that is likely to make them deeply unpopular. Labour does not favour prisoner voting rights but does not want to be seen to be ignoring the court.\n\nThe political advantage of agreeing to publish a draft bill is that the government would not be seen to be in open defiance of the European court in that it would be taking steps with the court order to introduce legislation on prisoners' rights.\n\nYet, in practice, a draft bill might take years to reach the statute book, since it would require wide consultation and allow amendment by a joint committee of both houses. The two alternatives are to table a fresh Commons motion, or to publish a bill.\n\nIn a marathon legal battle going back to 2004, the court has repeatedly ruled that a general and automatic disenfranchisement of all serving prisoners was incompatible with European law.\n\nThe UK government was given six months from a judgment in Scoppola v Italy on 22 May 2012 to bring forward legislative proposals to amend the law.\n\nBut the court has also accepted that member states should have a wide discretion as to how they regulate a ban on prisoner voting, in terms of the kind of offence, length of prison sentence, and the discretion given to individual judges to determine a prisoner's right to vote.\n\nThe British government's already acute dilemma has been deepened by the Commons overwhelmingly passing a motion in February 2011 stating that it supports \"the current situation in which no sentenced prisoner is able to vote except those imprisoned for contempt default or reprimand\". The motion was passed by 234 to 22.\n\nThe debate was led by the prominent Tory backbencher David Davis and by the former Labour justice secretary Jack Straw. Davis argued: \"If you break the law, you cannot make the law.\" Straw asserted: \"The issue of prisoners voting rights was by no stretch of the imagination a breach of fundamental human rights but was a matter of penal policy which the minority of judges at Strasbourg said should be left to the UK parliament.\" He accused the Strasbourg court of trying to set itself up as \"the supreme court of Europe\".\n\nMinistry of Justice sources denied they would comply with the ruling by publishing a draft bill, and stressed they were the lead department on the issue and opposed the right of prisoners to vote. They refused to discuss the state of internal negotiations, or whether a draft bill might be a means of deferring a decision. No 10 also deniedthere had been any decision to give prisoners voting rights.\n\n\u2022 The headline of this article was amended to 24 October 2012 to make clear that the ruling on prisoner votes was from the European court of human rights rather than the European Union.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351076784076/Prisoner-voting-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=220d1840cd6bac8c57a19b15944d3106", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Votes+for+prisoners%2CLaw%2CPrisons+and+probation%2CUK+criminal+justice%2CSociety%2CHuman+rights%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CConservatives", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351020736399/Prison-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7a3abcdf785a74eafc376e6855e716cb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351106649665/Attorney-general-Dominic--010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cc3bba933577f3dfad7ae12a3e50d34c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351020736399/Prison-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=948088a700480ca5f8c5d80111ef6df4", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351020736399/Prison-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7a3abcdf785a74eafc376e6855e716cb", "date": "23/10/2012"}, "rank_277": {"title": "United action is needed to protect the European science budget | Jenny Rohn", "text": "Euroscepticism in the UK seems as widespread as ever, with fears about the debt crisis and clashes over issues of employment law just a few items regularly in the news. But few people probably stop to ponder what Europe means to us Brits when it comes to the scientific sphere.\n\nIt's worth thinking about now as the EU attempts to hammer out an overall budget for the next seven years, with the summit of the European Union heads of state on 22 and 23 November being a key milestone.\n\nDavid Cameron, along with a number of other leaders, is lobbying vigorously to oppose an increase in the next budget above inflation. But the truth is that the EU funds a lot of British science, and Horizon 2020, the EU's research programme, is part of the budget under threat. According to the Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE), what's at stake is \u20ac80bn (\u00a363bn) in research funding, with the UK enjoying a larger-than-average share of this pot.\n\nYesterday, a petition aimed at fighting cuts to the EU science budget went live, sponsored by the Initiative for Science in Europe. ISE is an independent platform of European learned societies and scientific organisations striving to support science and to affect science policy at a European level, involving scientists themselves whenever possible.\n\nWolfgang Eppenschwandtner, the executive coordinator of ISE, told me that the petition is truly grassroots, having been initiated by young scientists holding Starting Grants from the European Research Council. The movement, coordinated with the publication of a high-profile letter signed by a large number of European Nobel laureates and Fields medalists, quickly caught fire. Eppenschwandtner added that the ultimate target of the petition was the meeting of Heads of State, which will decide on the spending for the major headings (research and innovation being one of them).\n\nIt certainly sounds like a no-brainer. I have, however, heard that a few scientists are somewhat uneasy about supporting the petition, worried that an increase of the UK's contribution to the EU might well come at the expense of the constrained \u2013 and always vulnerable \u2013 domestic science budget. So I asked Imrah Khan, head of CaSE, what he thought about the petition, and whether there were any downsides.\n\n\"Obviously the government wants to keep our contributions to the EU down,\" he replied, \"but if this comes at the expense of research spending then we'll be cutting off our nose to spite our face.

Daniel Boffey and Toby Helm ask if, as British euroscepticism deepens, the prime minister can avoid holding a national referendum on EU membership\n\nTwenty years ago, almost to the month, John Major was forced to spell out in the House of Commons the benefits of Britain's continued membership of the European project. As arguments raged over the Maastricht Treaty that would set out the EU's route map towards the euro, the then prime minister accepted there were concerns over the centralisation of powers in Brussels, the spiralling EU budget and the ability of bloated European institutions to deal with financial instability in the light of Britain's withdrawal from the ERM weeks earlier. But Major insisted, to the chagrin of many of his backbenchers, that \"a confident and successful community is a vital interest of this country\".\n\nToday many of the same issues clamour around the current prime minister as he prepares for this week's budget negotiations in Brussels. For Major, his reluctance to comply with the wishes of the so-called euro-sceptic \"bastards\" in his cabinet, and in his wider party, came to define his premiership. Europe split his party and ultimately wrecked his period at Number 10, as he struggled to keep the UK \"at the heart of Europe\" while at the same time negotiating opt-outs from its core projects, including the yet-to-be-born single currency itself. Then, as now, the prime minister tried to strike the difficult balance of being in Europe but not run by Europe.\n\nCameron is by instinct more eurosceptic than the country's previous Tory prime minister. But these days that brings him little protection from his own, ever more anti-EU, party. Last month 53 hardline eurosceptic backbenchers, backed by Labour, defied Cameron and publicly voted in favour of an effective cut in EU spending for the next seven-year budget round. Cameron had wanted to negotiate this week for a freeze in real terms, which would have been hard enough to achieve. But by ordering him to go much further a large section of his party is sending him to Brussels to perform a mission impossible.\n\nTwo decades on from Maastricht, the passion that Europe excites inside the Tory party is of a similar intensity. Last week the former EU commissioner Peter Mandelson recalled how Cameron, during a meeting between the two men in Brussels a few years ago, had had two striking observations to make on Europe. One was that it should stop constitutional navel-gazing and the other was that, if you put two Conservatives in a room, it is not long before they will fall out over Europe.\n\nBut the argument has moved on. In Major's day the eurosceptics were passionate about stopping the EU eroding British sovereignty while pro-European cabinet ministers such as Ken Clarke insisted they had little to worry about. There was rarely any serious talk of the UK getting out of the union altogether. Today \u2013 after the euro crisis \u2013 it is different. Tory eurosceptics, and much of the country, are not just expressing discontent with the direction in which the EU is moving. More and more actually want to leave. Our Opinium/Observer poll gives an extraordinary snapshot of hardening views against membership. Some 56% of people now say they would vote to leave the EU if they were given the chance in a referendum; 68% of Tory supporters would vote to leave \u2013 but more remarkably perhaps, 44% of Labour voters and 39% of Lib Dems would choose to leave.\n\nCameron does not want to be the prime minister who calls a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU and then leads us out. If he agreed to a national vote, he would have to campaign to remain inside. But a large section of his party and the public is rapidly heading in the other direction. Mark Reckless, the Tory MP who led the EU rebels in the recent parliamentary vote, made clear to the Observer that the row over the EU budget was not simply a matter of pounds and euros but would prove to be a precursor to a debate over whether the UK should be part of the European project at all.\n\nThe current crop of \"bastards\" seems determined to pursue, ruthlessly, that objective no matter what embarrassment or damage it may cause their leader.\n\nReckless said he did not believe Cameron could return to the Commons and win approval for anything less than a real terms cut in the budget. \"Parliament voted in clear majority against that inflationary increase or so-called real terms freeze,\" he said. \"It sent a clear message that, if the prime minister went and achieved his very modest objectives on that, it wouldn't be acceptable to parliament. He would need legislation to do that, and it would be defeated on the floor of the house.\"\n\nHe added that the parliamentary vote was about a rejection of the EU as a whole. \"I think there is now a clear majority, in almost every opinion poll, who want to come out. And for a very long time that view hasn't been represented in parliament, but for the first time two weeks ago we had a eurosceptic majority in the lobbies to cut the EU budget. People understand that much more when it is about money rather than about an institutional point.\"\n\nSo, if Cameron fails to veto an inflation-linked budget rise, Reckless believes that parliament will do it for him. He believes the rebellion in that event will be greater than last time round. \"I'm pretty confident that the number of people that we will add to our tally of 53 will be greater than those we lose the other way.\n\n\"So, if Labour stick with their position, I don't think the prime minister can get that real terms freeze which is his objective through parliament, so he is between a rock and a hard place.\n\n\"Ultimately, if there is no EU agreement here, there will be no EU budget.\n\n\"It will develop, I guess, into a situation where there is a parting of the ways, and we really have to decide whether we stay part of it \u2013 and they really have to think, are they going to operate without a budget because of their failure to come to terms with the UK?\"\n\nEven the likes of the veteran euro-sceptic Bill Cash \u2013 the scourge of John Major over Maastricht \u2013 would have steered clear of talking publicly about a British exit from the European Union 20 years ago. What was once beyond the pale has become the battle cry of the Tory backbenches.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/18/1353267212654/David-Cameron-is-heading--009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=130d5bff3f6eb2c34075a33a14d441b2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/19/1353354956187/David-Cameron-at-the-CBI--008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9fe6612107eaa2eef7631935fa55e968", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/11/17/1353167976288/Angela-Merkel-and-David-C-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=658b0271b34c5a7fe9ab9605ddbb7316", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353318390325/Ken-Clarke-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b83f3a6047e1504baa4b130e826ebad", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353336210534/David-Cameron-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acff531d79078c6e806b921765c2ede3", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservatives%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CDavid+Cameron%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CHouse+of+Commons", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/11/17/1353167976288/Angela-Merkel-and-David-C-007.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=26862cae39997378fdc19fef4f57e0bf", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/11/17/1353167976288/Angela-Merkel-and-David-C-007.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=658b0271b34c5a7fe9ab9605ddbb7316", "date": "17/11/2012"}, "rank_148": {"title": "10 key questions for Britain and Europe at the Brussels summit", "text": "What is the EU budget row about?\n\nThe EU sets a budget for seven-year periods and the one for 2014-20 has to be decided soon. EU leaders will attempt to thrash out a deal at this week's summit in Brussels. But agreement will be even more difficult than normal because of the state of the EU economy. Britain is leading those \"net contributor'' nations that say hard times mean the EU must cut back just as national governments have had to. But the poor \"net recipient'' countries which rely on EU spending say it is the EU's job to help boost growth when times are hard and argue that the success of the euro depends on spending, in order to spread wealth around more equally.\n\nIs the EU budget out of control?\n\nIt depends who you talk to. Eurosceptics would say \"yes'' because they do not agree with Europe's aim and objectives, but supporters of the EU project argue that it is far too low. The reality is that the EU budget remains tiny compared with those of national governments, and has grown less than many of them in recent years. In 2011 it was \u20ac140bn (\u00a3112bn) compared with the \u20ac6,300bn total of national budgets across the 27 member states. So national budgets are, cumulatively, almost 50 times the EU budget. The EU budget represents around 1% of GDP in the 27 member states.\n\nWhat is David Cameron's problem at the summit?\n\n\n\nThe prime minister said, originally, that he wanted a real-terms freeze \u2013 meaning the budget could not rise by more than inflation. But earlier this month Tory eurosceptics were joined by Labour in supporting a real terms reduction. By contrast the European commission's opening bid was for a 5% rise, while the European parliament wants a 6% increase. Cameron's negotiating position was hard enough before his Commons defeat. But now it is close to impossible. His chances of achieving a real-terms reduction are zero. But if he is to prevent meltdown in his predominantly anti-EU Tory party, that is what he needs to come home with.\n\nCan Cameron wield the veto?\n\n\n\nHe can, because a budget deal needs to be agreed by every member state. But it is not the easy, heroic option that many eurosceptics believe it is. Cameron dislikes much about the EU but he does not want the UK to leave it. A veto on the seven-year budget would be seen as a declaration of war by other member states. Questions about whether the UK should remain a member would be raised in Brussels and other capitals. What is more, by blocking the seven-year deal, Cameron would force the EU to set annual budgets instead, which they would do by qualified majority voting, meaning no veto for the UK. Annual budgets would almost certainly be higher than under a seven-year deal signed up to by all member states.\n\nHow does all this relate to the euro crisis?\n\nThe money being argued over this week has nothing directly to do with the euro. It is mainly money for agriculture and economic development across the EU. But if the EU cannot agree a budget at a time when the euro remains in peril and anti-austerity marches continue across much of Europe, then the financial markets will hardly see it as a positive sign of Europe's unity of purpose and ability to resolve its problems. And if new instability hits the euro as a result, the fact that it had been caused by UK actions would add to resentment against London.\n\nWhat is Labour up to?\n\n\n\nLabour under Ed Miliband and Ed Balls is still pro-European \u2013 at least in comparison to the Tories \u2013 but less so than it was under Tony Blair. It is conscious of rising euro-scepticism in the UK and is keen to be seen as sensitive to it, while distancing itself from any move that might hasten a UK exit. It is a difficult, tortuous balance. Politically Labour wants to paint Cameron as another John Major who is \"weak at home and weak abroad\". Controversially it backed Tory rebels' calls for a real-terms cut in the EU budget, arguing that the pro-European cause was harmed by unquestioning loyalty, in defiance of economic pressures. The big question will be how Labour votes in the Commons if and when Cameron fails to bring home an EU budget cut. Sources refuse to say it will vote down the deal.\n\nCan Cameron demand the repatriation of powers as the price for agreeing a budget deal?\n\n\n\nThe prime minister has said he wants to win back powers from the European Union and it may be he will try to sell this future possibility hard to his eurosceptics if he fails to get a budget deal they think is acceptable. Formally, though, EU leaders will not want to get into talking about the UK's demands to repatriate powers over police and justice or any other policy area this week. Cameron also faces huge problems inside the coalition with Nick Clegg and his Lib Dems being firmly opposed to any attempt by the government to repatriate powers on a large scale. Clegg has said it amounts to \"a false promise wrapped in a union jack\" and will resist at every turn.\n\nAre we heading for an in/out referendum that could take us out of the EU?\n\n\n\nPolitical leaders are worried about granting a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU for fear that the people might indeed vote to leave. But pressure is growing because euroscepticism is hardening in this country. Our poll today shows a majority of the public, including almost half of Labour supporters and well over a third of Liberal Democrats, would vote to leave if given the chance. Cameron suggests that a referendum will be the best way forward when the shape of the new EU is known, and a new treaty is agreed. But that could be years away. Both he and Ed Miliband will be under intense pressure to promise one much earlier, in their next election manifestos.\n\nCould Britain punch its weight outside the EU?\n\n\n\nEurosceptics say there is no reason why not. They cite the likes of Switzerland and Norway as examples of countries that have done perfectly well outside the EU. But the UK has long been a keen supporter of the single market and the vast majority of UK businesses would not want to see this country outside and unable to take part in setting its rules. Internationally, the UK would be locked out of EU foreign policy debates on key security issues. Foreign secretary William Hague, while a eurosceptic, now speaks enthusiastically about the EU's role in foreign affairs, making the point that 27 nations acting together can pack a punch far more powerful than when they act alone. The Foreign Office fears any exit from the EU would damage the \"special relationship\" with Washington.\n\nCan the tide of UK euroscepticism be halted or reversed?\n\n\n\nInterestingly it is not just opponents of the EU who are now calling for a referendum on the UK's membership. Many pro-Europeans in the Labour party, including Peter Mandelson and Jon Cruddas, are in favour. Cruddas, Labour's policy chief, has yet to convince Ed Miliband but he believes that a referendum is the way to clear the air, clarify views about the EU in this country, and put a stop to the endless arguments. Cruddas, although an opponent of the euro, believes that Labour can form a strong pro-EU alliance alongside the business community to argue the business case for Europe in a referendum. With business alongside Labour, the public will be won round he says. For Labour, a referendum would also have the benefit of splitting the Tories, as Cameron would support staying in while much of party would vote to leave.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/18/1353267212654/David-Cameron-is-heading--009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=130d5bff3f6eb2c34075a33a14d441b2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/19/1353354956187/David-Cameron-at-the-CBI--008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9fe6612107eaa2eef7631935fa55e968", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CPolitics%2CEurope%2CEuro%2CEuro%2CEurozone+crisis%2CForeign+policy%2CEuropean+commission%2CWorld+news%2CDavid+Cameron%2CUK+news%2CConservatives", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353318390325/Ken-Clarke-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5b83f3a6047e1504baa4b130e826ebad", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353336210534/David-Cameron-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acff531d79078c6e806b921765c2ede3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/17/1353171421724/David-Cameron-speaks-at-N-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09a2ce3ddb6ee4365fbc7ce1c7f62c69", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/17/1353171421724/David-Cameron-speaks-at-N-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=928a08b59ecb020eae458f7a3f694e01", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/17/1353171421724/David-Cameron-speaks-at-N-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=928a08b59ecb020eae458f7a3f694e01", "date": "17/11/2012"}, "rank_39": {"title": "Ed Miliband blames EU's 'real failings' for growing Euroscepticism", "text": "Labour leader defends Britain's membership of European Union but says many 'feel angry and frustrated' with it\n\nEd Miliband has blamed \"real failings\" in the EU for growing Euroscepticism in Britain but warned that quitting the European project would be a \"betrayal of the national interest\".\n\nThe Labour leader used a speech to the CBI to make an impassioned argument for Britain's membership of the EU, but said the pro-Europe stance could not \"just be the same old case made in the same old way\" and needed to acknowledge genuine grievances fuelling Euroscepticism in Britain.\n\nMiliband told business leaders: \"Increasingly we see Euroscepticism on the rise among the British public.

And the pro-European side of the cause has, I think, too often responded by turning a blind eye to the failings, if you like confusing passion for the European Union with passions with institutions of Europe.\"\n\nMiliband told business leaders there was an \"economic, political and strategic case\" for Britain remaining in the European Union, but also an \"urgent imperative\" to reform the EU.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/11/19/1353354956187/David-Cameron-at-the-CBI--008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9fe6612107eaa2eef7631935fa55e968", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353338473445/Ukip-candidate-Margot-Par-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=026af8c0334ed2f12b4fc2bd76d6f6e8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353336210534/David-Cameron-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acff531d79078c6e806b921765c2ede3", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Ed+Miliband%2CEuropean+Union%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CEurope%2CWorld+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353336111908/Ed-Miliband-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fe7e4101680ea915c56e4dcc594c785c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/17/1353171421724/David-Cameron-speaks-at-N-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=09a2ce3ddb6ee4365fbc7ce1c7f62c69", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353336111908/Ed-Miliband-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a76faaec9c00fde18590d24e36a1044d"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/19/1353336111908/Ed-Miliband-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a76faaec9c00fde18590d24e36a1044d", "date": "19/11/2012"}, "rank_286": {"title": "Tony Blair's passionate plea: we must stay at heart of EU \u2013 or face disaster", "text": "Tony Blair will make an impassioned intervention in the debate over Britain's future in Europe, warning that any disengagement from the European Union's \"top table\" would be a disaster for the UK's economy and its power on the world stage.\n\nWith more senior Tories backing moves that could see the UK leaving the EU mainstream, Blair will seek to rally the business community behind a campaign to halt the Eurosceptic bandwagon before it is too late.\n\nAt a speech in London on Wednesday, Blair will say that with major economies such as China, India, Brazil and Russia emerging as formidable competitors in the global economic power game, EU membership has never been more important. A source close to the former prime minister said: \"Whereas the postwar argument for Europe was about peace versus war, he will make the point that the 21st-century case for Europe is about power versus irrelevance.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's speech, to the Business for New Europe coalition of business leaders pushing for reform in Europe, Blair will argue that the EU needs to promote a \"grand plan\" about its purpose, driving home the message that member states can best take on these huge economic powers as a united bloc. He will highlight statistics showing that 47% of UK exports go to EU member states while 50% of foreign direct investment is from EU countries.\n\nBlair's move, ahead of a keynote speech on Europe by David Cameron expected next month, is likely to be seen as evidence that having failed in 2009 to become the first permanent president of the EU council he still hankers after a prominent role in European politics. Friends of Blair say he believes that the EU still lacks effective leadership and too often fails to promote a \"big vision\". Instead it too often gives the impression that it is obsessed with arcane, if important, institutional reform. Referring to moves to reform Europe's institutions to end the euro crisis, a source said: \"He will say that of course you have to get the politics and economics aligned but this has to be part of a grand plan not a series of incremental changes.\"\n\nNews of his intervention, following the breakdown on Friday of an EU budget summit at which Cameron, with support from Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, refused to agree a new seven-year budget for the bloc, comes as business leaders expressed growing unease about the Conservatives' anti-EU stance and the growing hostility to Europe among voters.\n\nLast week the CBI president, Sir Roger Carr, said UK membership of the EU was the \"launchpad\" for much international business. \"Whatever the popular appeal may be of withdrawal, businessmen and politicians must keep a bridge to Europe firmly in place,\" he said.\n\nSenior figures close to Ed Miliband believe that Labour \u2013 with Blair potentially playing a key role \u2013 can form a powerful alliance with business to argue the pro-EU case both in the runup to the next general election and during any future referendum on Europe.\n\nWhile European leaders refused to criticise Cameron for his tough line on the budget, some said that Britain's influence would begin to wane in key negotiations if it made clear its aim was to disengage.\n\nGuy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who now leads the Liberal group in the European parliament, said: \"There is a feeling that there is a hidden agenda [for the UK], a feeling that they want second-class membership. It is weakening its position around the negotiating table.\"\n\nWhile EU leaders had shown respect for Cameron over his demands for spending cuts, sources said that patience would not last if the UK continued to stand in the way of future reforms of the EU and eurozone. European leaders are now anxiously waiting to see how the UK reacts to proposals for an EU banking union to be considered at the next summit on 13 and 14 December. \"People have to realise that the train is not stopping. It is going forward,\" said Verhofstadt.\n\nA senior Brussels official said: \"We always hear that the UK has special demands but never that Europe has special needs.\"\n\nTory chairman Grant Shapps became the latest high-ranking Tory to entertain the idea of the UK leaving the EU when he said that the prime minister should not be afraid to use a threat to quit as a way to force other member states to allow repatriation of powers to Britain.\n\nTory Eurosceptics praised Cameron's performance in Brussels but warned that the battle was only just beginning. Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee and a leading Eurosceptic, said that the breakdown of the summit showed \"how dysfunctional the EU has become and underlines the fact that there needs to be a new relationship for those who do not want to be part of the federal eurozone\".\n\nJenkin said that he and other Eurosceptics would now back calls for there to be a \"mandate referendum\" before the next general election to find out what sort of relationship the British people wanted to have with the EU.\n\nCameron will make a statement on the outcome of the Brussels budget summit in the House of Commons on Monday.", "images": ["https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Andrew-Rawnsley,-L.png", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/11/24/1353757042773/David-Cameron-015.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3af8b26b5f8d91db41312cab2803007d", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Tony+Blair%2CEuropean+Union%2CPolitics%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/23/1353676453953/Guy-Verhofstadt-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cf6975c787d8e6297c9cfb860155db5f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/24/1353784227885/Tony-Blair-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=18b7085d2112935d8dcb478d5d4f9b78", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/24/1353784227885/Tony-Blair-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d5527e4ea2e506a4efb940da2626e1c2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/23/1353692168975/39432ad6-6ca8-4bdf-922d-9289def9f8a9-2048.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a14eff9548865ed13e93f3a7708df07e"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/11/24/1353784227885/Tony-Blair-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=18b7085d2112935d8dcb478d5d4f9b78", "date": "24/11/2012"}, "rank_108": {"title": "Boris Johnson knows how to play the Eurosceptic press | Paul Haydon", "text": "On Tuesday, Boris Johnson made his latest thinly veiled bid for the Tory leadership, outlining his own distinctive vision of Britain's relationship with the EU ahead of David Cameron's crucial, defining speech on Europe later this month. He called for Britain's EU membership to be \"boiled down to the single market\", scrapping the social chapter and other pesky regulations from Brussels. He then went on to suggest that Britain should join the \"outer tier\" of Europe along with Switzerland and Norway, while maintaining an active role in shaping single market legislation.\n\nNever mind that neither Norway nor Switzerland's relationship with the EU is purely based on free trade, never mind that minimum social and employment standards are an inextricable part of the single market: Johnson knows how to play the keys of Eurosceptic press like a concert pianist. This may just be because when it comes to British Euroscepticism, Boris Johnson invented the Steinway. As Sonia Purnell points out in her biography, during his stint as the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent from 1989 to 1995, Johnson pioneered the kind of acerbic anti-European polemicism that dominates much of the press today. One of his articles referred to the \"noxious aromas emanating from Holland\", a reference to the fumes of Dutch pig manure reportedly being detected in Essex. Another accused a French minister of trying to ban the use of certain English words.\n\nThe Murdoch newspapers in particular followed Johnson's lead. In a BBC poll on the most memorable front page of the century, Johnson paid tribute to this by nominating an edition of the Sun from 1990 which called on readers to \"tell the filthy French to frog off\". The article went on to say that \"they insult us, burn our lambs, flood our country with dodgy food and plot to abolish the dear old pound\".\n\nJohnson last night described David Cameron's stance on eurozone integration as \"intellectualy and morally wrong,\" calling for a policy rooted solely in Britain's long-term interests. Yet when it come to Euroscepticism in the press, vested interests are likely to play a much stronger role. Rupert Murdoch has a deep commercial and ideological aversion to the EU, viewing its anti-monopoly laws as a threat to the expansion of his media empire and its social policies as antithetical to his economically neoliberal worldview. Other newspaper proprietors, the Barclay brothers of the Daily Telegraph, Richard Desmond of the Daily Express, and Lord Rothermere of the Daily Mail, have similar political and business interests in advocating British withdrawal from the EU.\n\nUndoubtedly, the economic pressures facing newspapers have also played a part. Not one of the rightwing tabloids currently has a full-time correspondent in Brussels, leading to a reliance on freelance reporters who are in constant competition to come up with the most ludicrous story about the EU. Having helped foster deeply Eurosceptic attitudes, the rightwing press must now compete to pander to them.\n\nAs a consequence, over the past two decades the EU has been subjected to a daily barrage of attacks, ranging from gross exaggeration to outright fabrication. Screaming headlines denounce the latest sinister plot from Brussels, whether it is banning selling eggs by the dozen, stopping children from blowing up balloons, or even plotting to liquify corpses and pour them down the drain. Many of these \"Euro myths\" have now become deeply embedded in the popular imagination. It is perhaps no coincidence that 18- to 24-year-olds, who are more likely to get their news online than from traditional print media, are the only UK age group in which a majority would vote to stay in the EU.\n\nJohnson now finds himself wrestling with the Eurosceptic monster he has helped to create. The mayor of London is torn between the broadly pro-European voices of the City of London and business leaders, who want to see their interests protected through constructive engagement with the EU, and the Tory grassroots, who are baying for the blood of Brussels bureaucrats. Already, he has faced criticism from those in the party who see his latest speech as a betrayal of his previous support for a straight in-out referendum.\n\nNevertheless, as a seasoned Eurosceptic journalist himself, Johnson knows all too well how to play the rightwing press, which has come out in force to support his call for partial disengagement. His description of the euro as a \"calamitous project\" could have come straight from a Daily Mail editorial. Crucially, by giving the tabloids just enough red meat, he has been able to speak out against a British exit without coming under fire.\n\nThe recent conclusions of the Leveson inquiry have shown how Murdoch and other media moguls have been able to significantly influence Britain's policy on the EU, pressuring successive governments to adopt a particular line. In Boris Johnson, however, they may have just met their match.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/5/1354707271599/Boris-Johnson-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0218efb21bf079c427ab35aa97adda21", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/5/1354707271599/Boris-Johnson-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b52d1d41206556289477acaa935c6966", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CEuropean+Union%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CBrexit%2CForeign+policy%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CMedia%2CNational+newspapers%2CDaily+Telegraph%2CConservatives%2CEurope", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/5/1354707271599/Boris-Johnson-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b52d1d41206556289477acaa935c6966", "date": "05/12/2012"}, "rank_37": {"title": "Euroscepticism growing among voters, Guardian/ICM poll finds", "text": "More than half of respondents say they would vote to take UK out of EU if a referendum took place tomorrow\n\nThe public mood of Euroscepticism is hardening, according to an exclusive Guardian/ICM poll that finds 51% of respondents would vote to take Britain out of the EU, against just 40% who say they would vote to stay in.\n\nThe news comes as the prime minister prepares to give a widely anticipated speech on Britain's relationship with the EU in the new year.\n\nThe last time ICM asked the same question, in autumn 2011, opinion was already leaning in the anti-European direction, by 49% against 40%, but a slight hardening of opinion since that time means that anti-EU feeling is now just in the majority.\n\nThis marks a turnaround from similar polls conducted in the earliest years of this century. When ICM asked a slightly differently worded question in May 2001, the public indicated that it wanted Britain to remain a member of Europe by 68% to 19%.\n\nEurope_ICM1\n\nEven worse news for the pro-Europeans emerges when respondents were asked about how definite they were in their view. Fully 36% say they would definitely vote to pull Britain out, against just 22% who definitely want to stay in. That compares with 18% who say they would probably want to stay in, and 15% who indicate that they would probably want to get out.\n\nThe deteriorating standing of the European Union emerges at the end of a year in which it has won the Nobel peace prize for its success in bringing peace to a continent, but also \u2013 and perhaps more significantly \u2013 a year which has been marked by the crisis of the single currency moving from an acute to a chronic phase.\n\nThe anti-European mood seizing large parts of the electorate was reaffirmed by other questions in the same survey. When voters were asked to provide a \"school report grade\" for the work of various institutions, the EU was awarded a D+, somewhat worse than the C- average mark awarded to both David Cameron and Ed Miliband. The poll also affirmed that support for the anti-European party Ukip was running at 7% for a second month in a row, a record high in the long-running Guardian/ICM series.\n\nThere is a recognisable split on partisan lines, but it is not quite as marked as the very different language about Europe used by the three party leaders might suggest.\n\nFifty-seven percent of Tories want to pull Britain out, compared with 44% of Labour supporters and 34% of Lib Dems. But Cameron may be interested to learn than only 41% of his party's supporters are definitely committed to pulling Britain out, leaving a majority of Conservatives who retain a more equivocal or pro-European position.\n\nThe hardcore \"definitely vote to leave\" vote is stronger among men, 40% of whom are in this camp, than among women, among whom only 32% take this view. There is a sharp age gradient in Euroscepticism, too; 49% of pensioners aged 65+ are in this hardline camp, compared with just 16% of the youngest voters, aged 18 to 24.\n\nThere is a strong anti-European contingent across the regions and social classes, although some signs that hostility to Brussels is more marked in England and less marked among professionals.\n\nOnly 32% of voters in the top AB social definitely want to quit Europe, compared with 45% of the skilled manual workers group, classified as C2. Whereas as in England 38% are in this hardline camp, in Scotland and Wales the respective figures are just 27% and 26%.\n\n\u2022 ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1002 adults aged 18+ by telephone on 19-23rd December 2012.

But Euroscepticism has now spread across the continent like a virus. As the data from Eurobarometer shows, trust in the European project has fallen even faster than growth rates. Since the beginning of the crisis, trust in the EU has fallen from +10 to -22 in France, from +20 to -29 points in Germany, from +30 to -22 points in Italy, from +42 to -52 points in Spain, from +50 to +6 points in Poland and from -13 to -49 points in the UK.\n\nWhat is striking is that everyone in the EU has lost faith in the project: both creditors and debtors, and eurozone countries, would-be members and \"opt-outs\". Back in 2007, people thought that the UK, which scored minus 13 points in trust, was the Eurosceptic outlier. Now, remarkably, the four largest eurozone countries have even lower levels of trust in the EU institutions than Britain back in 2007. So what is going on?\n\nThe old explanation for Euroscepticism was the alleged existence of a democratic deficit within the EU. Decisions, critics said, were taken by unaccountable institutions rather than elected national governments. But the current crisis is born not of a clash between Brussels and the member states but a clash between the democratic wills of citizens in northern and southern Europe, the so-called centre and periphery. And both sides are now using the EU institutions to advance their interests.\n\nIn the past, there was an unwritten rule that EU institutions would police the single market and other technical areas of policy \u2013 from common standards for the composition of tomato paste to lawnmower sound emissions \u2013 while national governments would continue to have a monopoly on the delivery of services and policymaking in the most sensitive areas on which national elections depended.\n\nSince the crisis began, citizens in creditor countries have become resistant to taking responsibility for the debts of others without having mechanisms for controlling their spending. With the fiscal compact and demands by the ECB for comprehensive domestic reforms, Eurocrats have crossed many of the red lines of national sovereignty, extending their reach way beyond food safety standards to exert control over pensions, taxes, salaries, labour market, and public jobs. These areas go to the heart of the welfare states and national identities.\n\nTo an increasing number of citizens in southern European countries, the EU looks like the IMF did in Latin America: a golden straitjacket that is strangling the space for national politics and emptying their national democracies of content. In this new scenario, governments come or go but policies remain basically the same and cannot be challenged. Meanwhile, in northern European countries, the EU is increasingly seen to have failed as a controller for the policies of the southern rim. The creditors have a sense of victimhood that mirrors that of the debtors.\n\nIf sovereignty is understood as the capacity of the people to decide what they want for their country, few in either the north or the south today feel that they are sovereign. A substantial part of democracy has vanished at the national level but it has not been recreated at the European level.\n\nIn a fully-functioning national political system, political parties would be able to voice these different perspectives \u2013 and hopefully act as a referee and find common ground between them. But that is precisely what the European political system cannot deliver: because it lacks true political parties, a proper government and a public sphere, the EU cannot compensate the failures of national democracies. Instead of a battle of ideas, the EU has been marred by a vicious circle between anti-EU populism and technocratic agreements between member states that are afraid of their citizens.\n\nIs the rise of anti-EU populism here to stay? The hope is that as growth picks up, Euroscepticism will weaken and eventually recede. But the collapse of trust in the EU runs deeper than that. Enthusiasm for the EU will not return unless the EU profoundly changes the way it deals with its member states and its citizens.\n\nGermany\n\nGermans see themselves as the victims of the euro crisis. They feel they have been betrayed and fear that they will be asked to pay higher taxes or accept higher levels of inflation in order to save the euro. But the jury is still out in Germany on the EU itself. The Eurobarometer data shows that 56% of Germans have \"no trust\" in the EU while only 30% have a \"fairly positive\" image of the EU.\n\nAt the same time, however, populism so far been contained: the mainstream political parties all support the euro and recent polls show that three-quarters of Germans are against leaving the euro. A new anti-euro party, the Alternative for Germany, has just been set up but is so far projected to get at best 2% of the vote in September's general election. Germans may not love the euro anymore but that does not mean they want to leave it. As recent polls show, 3/4 of Germans reject leaving the euro.\n\nFrance\n\nFor once, France is no exception: since the crisis began trust in the EU has diminished and its image has worsened. In 2012 the number of French respondents who \"tend not to trust\" the EU rose to 56 % from 41% in 2007.\n\nThis negative judgement about the EU's response to the crisis has already had an impact on French politics: it is undoubtedly a factor in the even deeper entrenchment of the violently anti-EU, far-right National Front in France's political life and an equally significant factor in the political and media success of the radical left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon.\n\nHowever, if the French people are able to identify a visible, resolute and accountable leadership at EU or eurozone level that gives economic recovery priority by focusing on debt reduction as much as on investment strategies, growth policies and indeed takes the first step towards pan-European welfare models, then the anti-EU trend could be reversed.\n\nUK\n\nPerceptions of the EU in the UK have changed less dramatically than in many other member states: even in 2004 there was a relatively low level of trust in, and a relatively negative image of, the EU.\n\nThe percentage of those who \"tend not to trust\" the EU has gone from 48% in 2004 to nearly 80% in 2012. But this increase began long before the crisis began and is unlikely to be reversed even if and when the crisis is resolved.\n\nGiven that the UK is unlikely to join the single currency in the foreseeable future, it will be in the third tier of the emerging three-tier Europe (the first made of eurozone members, the second of would-be ins and the third made of eurozone \"outs\", ie those who would not join the eurozone even if they could). Thus the question from a British perspective is how the UK can retain influence from the margins of Europe. In particular, there is likely to be a demand for a new settlement that guarantees the rights of eurozone \"outs\".\n\nItaly\n\nAusterity is changing perceptions of the EU among Italian citizens \u2013 especially among the young, 40% of whom are unemployed. The recent Italian election vote showed that Italians have lost their faith in and patience with Brussels and Berlin and no longer believe that the end of the crisis is around the corner.\n\nBut although trust in the EU has decreased in Italy, a majority of Italian respondents still see themselves as European citizens and identify with Europe. In a recent poll, only 1% wanted to leave the EU. Instead, a large majority \u2013 especially among the business community \u2013 want to move ahead to a real political union that is more democratic and more social than the current EU. The election did not show that Italians want less Europe. Rather, they want a different Europe: one that is more flexible and more symmetrical, less focused on austerity and more focused on investment in the real economy.\n\nSpain\n\nFor decades, Spain saw its relationship with Europe through the eyes of Ortega y Gasset's prescription: \"Spain is the problem and Europe is the solution\". The dramatic and unprecedented decline in trust in the EU since the crisis began is not simply a result of austerity. After all, Spain went through painful reforms in order to join the EU and, later, the euro, and overcome their difficult past.\n\nNow, however, the lack of a clear vision about either the national or European future means there is no consensus and legitimacy for the sacrifices that are being demanded of them. Spaniards do not blame Europe for the crisis and do not want to leave the euro. What has eroded their loyalty to, and trust in, Europe is that they have no voice and cannot challenge policies that are clearly not working. Spaniards have not become Eurosceptics \u2013 but they have turned into fierce Eurocritics.\n\nPoland\n\nFor the first time, the percentage of Poles who \"tend not to trust\" the EU (46%) is higher than the percentage of Poles who do \"tend to trust\" it (41%) \u2013 a remarkable development for a country that has traditionally been pro-European. To be sure, the EU still has higher approval ratings than the national government, parliament or public television.\n\nHowever, the EU seems to have lost its reputation as the anchor of stability for a country undergoing a huge social and economic transformation. In particular, the Poles are sceptical about the future of the common currency and only 29% of them wish now to join it. These public attitudes pose a dilemma for the country's political elite whose ambition is to be at the centre of power in Europe. Poland's objective in the years ahead will be to stay as close to the core as possible while defending the integrity of the whole EU project.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/4/18/1366295948388/Euro-coin-map-of-Europe-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=96f9efdb1b7a14497aa1903311b9f1c4", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEurozone+crisis%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+monetary+union%2CEconomics%2CBanking%2CEuropean+banks%2CFinancial+crisis%2CEuropean+Central+Bank%2CFinancial+sector%2CEuro%2CEurope", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/24/1366813943380/EU-flags-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e38616ff5782d734f91e36ec1cddb91a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/8/3/1407092870042/Mark-Leonard-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=91f2cc1f7105672f2fc1fe663953716f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/4/18/1366295948388/Euro-coin-map-of-Europe-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71d6b2a3b76f9307e11dada63a04ae15", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/18/1366295976155/The-European-parliament-i-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=814758ac635c89db617814b21482d698"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/4/18/1366295948388/Euro-coin-map-of-Europe-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=96f9efdb1b7a14497aa1903311b9f1c4", "date": "24/04/2013"}, "rank_113": {"title": "Crisis for Europe as trust hits record low", "text": "Public confidence in the European Union has fallen to historically low levels in the six biggest EU countries, raising fundamental questions about its democratic legitimacy more than three years into the union's worst ever crisis, new data shows.\n\nAfter financial, currency and debt crises, wrenching budget and spending cuts, rich nations' bailouts of the poor, and surrenders of sovereign powers over policymaking to international technocrats, Euroscepticism is soaring to a degree that is likely to feed populist anti-EU politics and frustrate European leaders' efforts to arrest the collapse in support for their project.\n\nFigures from Eurobarometer, the EU's polling organisation, analysed by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), a thinktank, show a vertiginous decline in trust in the EU in countries such as Spain, Germany and Italy that are historically very pro-European.\n\nThe six countries surveyed \u2013 Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Spain, and Poland \u2013 are the EU's biggest, jointly making up more than two out of three EU citizens or around 350 million of the EU's 500 million population.\n\nThe findings, published exclusively in the Guardian in Britain and in collaboration with other leading newspapers in the other five countries, represent a nightmare for Europe's leaders, whether in the wealthy north or in the bailout-battered south, suggesting a much bigger crisis of political and democratic legitimacy.\n\nCredit: Guardian graphics\n\n\"The damage is so deep that it does not matter whether you come from a creditor, debtor country, euro would-be member or the UK: everybody is worse off,\" said Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Torreblanca, head of the ECFR's Madrid office. \"Citizens now think that their national democracy is being subverted by the way the euro crisis is conducted.\"\n\nEU leaders are aware of the problem, utterly at odds over what to do about it, and have yet to come up with any coherent policy proposals addressing the mismatch between the pooling of economic and fiscal powers and the democratic mandate deemed necessary to underpin such radical policy shifts.\n\nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European commission president, said on Tuesdaythis week the European \"dream\" was under threat from a \"resurgence of populism and nationalism\" across the EU. \"At a time when so many Europeans are faced with unemployment, uncertainty and growing inequality, a sort of 'European fatigue' has set in, coupled with a lack of understanding. Who does what, who decides what, who controls whom and what? And where are we heading to?\"\n\nThe most dramatic fall in faith in the EU has occurred in Spain, where the banking and housing market collapse, eurozone bailout and runaway unemployment have combined to produce 72% \"tending not to trust\" the EU, with only 20% \"tending to trust\".\n\nThe data compares trust and mistrust in the EU at the end of last year with levels in 2007, before the financial crisis, to reveal a precipitate fall in support for the EU of the kind that is common in Britain but is much more rarely seen on the continent.\n\nIn Spain, trust in the EU fell from 65% to 20% over the five-year period while mistrust soared to 72% from 23%.\n\nIn five of the six countries, including Britain, mistrust prevailed over trust by sizeable margins, whereas in 2007 \u2013 with the exception of the UK \u2013 the opposite was the case.\n\nFive years ago, 56% of Germans \"tended to trust\" the EU, whereas 59% now \"tend to mistrust\". In France, mistrust has risen from 41% to 56%. In Italy, where public confidence in Europe has traditionally been higher than in the national political class, mistrust of the EU has almost doubled from 28% to 53%.\n\nEven in Poland, which enthusiastically joined the EU less than a decade ago and is the single biggest beneficiary from the transfers of tens of billions of euros from Brussels, support has plummeted from 68% to 48%, although it remains the sole country surveyed where more people trust than mistrust the union.\n\nIn Britain, where Eurobarometer regularly finds majority Euroscepticism, the mistrust grew from 49% to 69%, the highest level with the exception of the extraordinary turnaround in Spain.\n\nA separate, more detailed study published this week on the impact of the currency and debt crisis and the austerity policies that have followed also found steep falls across the EU in faith in democracy and national political elites.\n\nThe study for the Cabinet Office by the European Social Survey, linking university researchers across the EU, found that soaring unemployment, anxiety and insecurity had eroded faith in politics.\n\n\"Overall levels of political trust and satisfaction with democracy [declined] across much of Europe, but this varied markedly between countries. It was significant in Britain, Belgium, Denmark and Finland, particularly notable in France, Ireland, Slovenia and Spain, and reached truly alarming proportions in the case of Greece,\" it said.\n\nThe financial crisis \"not only eroded the objective economic conditions of many citizens, but also created widespread anxiety about a country's future even among those who did not experience hardship directly\".\n\nFaced with this erosion of political support and the battering traditional politics is taking from populist newcomers such as Beppe Grillo's Five Star movement in Italy, policymakers appear at a loss.\n\nOn Monday, Barroso said the austerity policies being applied, mainly under pressure from Berlin, had reached the \"limits of political and social acceptance\" and were \"unsustainable\" in their current form. On Tuesday, though, the commission in Brussels sought to row back on his remarks.\n\nWithin the eurozone, the key response to the crisis, apart from bailouts, has been to embark on a systematic surrender of budgetary and fiscal powers from national governments and parliaments to Brussels, as well as having countries being bailed out overseen by a \"troika\" of technocrats and economists from the commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These are \"federalising\" steps in a long process of eurozone integration that might see it transformed from a currency into a political union.\n\n\"The EU has hit home and is here to stay as a watchdog of budgets, labour markets, pensions etc. This is unprecedented, and risky,\" said Torreblanca. \"Unless it is fixed, it will feed the vicious circle between anti-EU populism and technocracy which we are currently seeing operating.\"\n\nBarroso argued strongly in two speeches this week that federalism was the only answer to Europe's crisis of finances and of confidence. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, brushing off widespread fears of a new German \"hegemony\" in Europe and the eurozone, also said that governments had to give up much more power to Brussels.\n\n\"We still haven't found the answer to the question of whether we're actually now prepared to unite on common economic parameters inside the single currency area,\" she said in a Berlin debate with the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk. \"If we want to have a common currency, a common Europe, we have to be ready to give up our hard-won habits \u2026 That means we have to be prepared to accept that in the end Europe has the final word in certain things. Otherwise we can't keep on building this Europe \u2026 To an extent, we have to jump over our own shadows. I'm ready for that.\"\n\nBut Tusk delivered an unusually stark warning that German prescriptions could bring increasing nationalism and populism across the EU in a backlash that was already well under way.\n\n\"We can't escape this dilemma: how do you get a new model of sovereignty so that limited national sovereignty in the EU is not dominated by the biggest countries like Germany, for example,\" he said pointedly. \"Under the surface, this fear will be everywhere: in Warsaw, in Athens, in Stockholm. It will be everywhere without exception.\"\n\nAart de Geus, head of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German thinktank, also warned that the drive to surrender more key national powers to Brussels would backfire. \"Public support for the EU has been falling since 2007. So it is risky to go for federalism as it can cause a backlash and unleash greater populism.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2013/4/24/1366823979395/EU-lack-of-trust-008.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b19eacb09e972047287dbd924809e4b0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/24/1366813943380/EU-flags-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e38616ff5782d734f91e36ec1cddb91a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/24/1366813943380/EU-flags-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c3a817c151db754a262b16d3595cbf4a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/19/1400510993181/Merkel-and-Hollande-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46c9742306d0b28bb507bfe2025232df", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/4/18/1366295948388/Euro-coin-map-of-Europe-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71d6b2a3b76f9307e11dada63a04ae15", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEurope%2CGermany%2CSpain%2CFrance%2CItaly%2CPoland%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/18/1366295976155/The-European-parliament-i-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=814758ac635c89db617814b21482d698", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400698871819/Jean-Claude-Juncker-of-th-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=385ee228df3ebee2cbe3ce8c325926a4"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/24/1366813943380/EU-flags-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c3a817c151db754a262b16d3595cbf4a", "date": "24/04/2013"}, "rank_279": {"title": "Eurocepticism no bar to close British-French defence ties", "text": "\u2022 French minister stresses \"pragmatic\" cooperation \u2022 Europe's two largest military powers could set the pace for other countries\n\nEuroscepticism might be spreading across Britain - and other EU countries \u2014 but it does not appear to be affecting Britain's relations with France.\n\nAt least not in one important area. Far from it.\n\nCooperation between the two nations on defence seems to be flourishing. The French defence minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, helped to explain why at a press conference in London on Thursday.\n\nLe Drian, a Breton who speaks little English, came to see see Philip Hammond, his UK counterpart, in the framework of the Franco-British defence agreements enshrined in the 2010 Lancaster House Treaties.\n\nThe two countries enjoy mutual respect because of the capabilities of their armed forces and willingness to deploy them. And certainly Hammond and David Cameron appreciated the emphasis the French (socialist) government placed on nuclear weapons in its recent defence white paper.\n\nThere is more to it than that. After saying he enjoyed an \"excellent\" relationship with Hammond, Le Drian suggested why the two governments got on so well, in military matters at least.\n\nHe charactersised cooperation between the two countries as \"pragmatic\" \u2014 a word he emphasised five times in barely half an hour. He stressed the need for \"concrete\" steps with decisions taken by \"sovereign\" nation states.\n\nOther European countries were welcome to join in such defence cooperation but it would be little to do with Brussels or the EU.\n\nThat was the message.\n\n\"I don't speak of European defence but speak of the defence of Europe\", was how Le Drian put it.\n\nBritish and French forces have been deployed together in large-scale exercises and they plan to be able to deploy a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force from 2016.\n\nThey plan to develop an Anglo-French sea-launched missile and have joint projects designed to secure and maintain nuclear warhead stockpiles (in Valduc in France and Aldermaston in the UK).\n\nBritain and France are now planning to develop unmanned aerial vehicles \u2014 UAVs or drones, as they are commonly called.\n\nThe huge capability gaps in European defence capabilities were exposed during the Libyan conflict two years ago when Britain and France had to rely on US surveillance and intelligence -gathering aircraft.\n\nIn Mali in January, France needed the help of US intelligence assets and UAVs. Significantly, Le Drian was flying from London to Washington where France hopes to buy a number of US Reaper drones.\n\nFrance already cooperates closely with the US on aircraft carriers \u2014 both countries use \"cats and traps\" planes \u2014 aircraft using catapults and arrester gear.\n\nThe British government last year abandoned its 2010 decision to equip its new carriers with \"cats and traps\" on grounds of cost. It has ordered the short take off and vertical landing version of Lockheed Martin's F35 fighter, at a cost unknown.\n\nWhere does this leave the rest of western Europe, and Germany in particular?\n\n\"Germany needs to take a bigger part in European defence and security -play a bigger part in the debate on collective security\", a British defence minister told a recent European Council on Foreign Relations meeting in London.\n\n\"If European countries do not hang together they will hang separately\", commented a former senior UK diplomat who warned that the US could be an \"unreliable ally\".\n\nA European summit devoted to defence is due to be held in December.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Defence+policy%2CUK+news%2CFrance%2CEurope", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/31/1359633767708/Jean-Yves-Le-Drian-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca809df3954fedbf59f6ec1aaae2b6a1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/31/1359633767708/Jean-Yves-Le-Drian-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=809b43f67d32c28edec77f39df6bc30d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/1/31/1359633767708/Jean-Yves-Le-Drian-010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ca809df3954fedbf59f6ec1aaae2b6a1", "date": "16/05/2013"}, "rank_270": {"title": "Eurovision: it's time to stop laughing at foreigners | Karen Fricker", "text": "British Euroscepticism has topped the news all week, most obviously around Ukip's surge and the in-out EU referendum bill, but it is also on display in the UK media's coverage of the Eurovision song contest. Coverage has, for the past 15-20 years, been overwhelmingly negative \u2013 more so than in any other country participating in the annual songfest.\n\nTrash-talking Eurovision, particularly in the ironic-humorous style popularised by Sir Terry Wogan, has become the UK's default mode for its coverage and public response. So much so that many readers of this article might already be starting to turn off from my argument, because Eurovision as silly, dismissable, tasteless \u2013 well, just a bit too \"European\", really \u2013 is the only possible interpretation. But please, bear with me, long enough to consider that there might be other possible angles on a television programme watched by more than 100 million people a year. I think Eurovision-bashing reflects a crisis of collective national identity in the UK; it's a way of expressing feelings of unprocessed anger, frustration, and loss about the UK's place in the rapidly changing Europe and in the world more broadly. The great British social theorist Paul Gilroy has written of the UK's post-colonial melancholy, a failure to properly process and accept the end of the country's status as world leader, and I think that's what's at play here.\n\nThe UK has been suffering a prolonged national identity crisis since the 1950s, in which resistance to European integration became a crucial unifying factor. Eurovision became a popular institution where this identity crisis and resultant Euroscepticism played out, and Wogan's commentary was its key conduit. From his earliest days as commentator, Wogan positioned the British as bemused participants in a distinctly foreign, European spectacle, one in which the UK nonetheless enjoyed success and status. He constructed an ideal listener who was, like him, male (or masculine-identified), British (or British-identified), and white. Yes, he was often very funny, but his humour came from comments about individual acts and performers: what might also be described as laughing at foreigners.\n\nThis relatively benign expression of Euroscepticism started to turn toxic as the contest expanded in the late 1990s and the UK, along other well-established nations, started to fare poorly. Wogan dismissed performance strategies that he could not fit within his understood Eurovision norms, and spun increasingly paranoid tales of political voting conspiracies. No substantive proof exists that Britain's first-ever nul points result in 2003 was because the rest of Europe was punishing the UK for its participation in the Iraq war (and indeed one could look to Jemini's off-tune performance for a more obvious reason), yet the UK media adopted Wogan's \"post-Iraq backlash\" hypothesis as fact.\n\nThough considerations beyond the musical have shaped the contest and its voting practices from the beginning, Wogan became nostalgic for a pure, prelapsarian Eurovision that never existed. Increasingly, he used martial language to describe the UK's relationship to Eurovision (\"we'll be back next year to give them a damn good thrashing!\", he said in 2003 after the Jemini debacle). And so the true nature of Wogan's nostalgia became clear: he wasn't longing for an uncorrupted Eurovision, he was actually nostalgic for the UK as a European and global power, aggressively defending its interests on the continent and around the world.\n\nWogan exited the commentator's chair after the 2008 contest, and Graham Norton has substituted his slightly irreverent camp banter for Wogan's ironic snark. Wogan's real legacy continues in the dull roar of negativity that emanates from the UK media year after year.\n\nBut there is another way of looking at the UK's recent relationship to Eurovision, that offers a more optimistic vision of the country's ability to tolerate difference, particularly the internal differences that characterise the post-imperial, multicultural, multinational British state. The UK's Eurovision acts since 1997 have been stylistically varied, and the country has been represented by a notably diverse group of artists. The last time the UK won Eurovision with Katrina and the Waves, an immigrant (the American Katrina Leskinach) led the act. A year later, the black British singer Imaani came second. Since that time no fewer than seven of the UK's entries have been sung by solo artists who are of colour or mixed heritage or by groups featuring artists of varied ethnic background. Musical styles have ranged from R&B to upbeat soul, to pop with rap elements, to urban dance music. Performers' ages have ranged from 19 to 76. This year's entry, Bonnie Tyler, is evidence of both intra-national diversity and age acceptance, being a 61-year-old Welsh woman.\n\nThese Eurovision entries offer a portrait of a lively and diverse society attempting to adapt to a cultural showcase whose codes and conventions are rapidly changing. The Eurovision stage is slowly but discernibly becoming a more diverse place. While celebrated as performing one of the most commercially successful Eurovision songs in many years, the Swedish 2012 winner, Loreen, is also notable for her background and her performance choices: her parents are of Moroccan Berber descent, and she danced on stage with a black man. This represents positive progress towards a contest that more accurately reflects the mingling of nationalities, ethnicities, and cultural traditions that is the reality of today's Europe. Were it to shift its perspective away from Eurosceptic nostalgia, the UK might perceive that, in this, it is already leading the way.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/19/1368920861378/Emmelie-de-Forest-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=16fe57db5ad41f7229586fae62316c1c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368789821187/Loreen-Swedish-winner-of--008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=be781cbfc724ebf52086be72a06d5a11", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368789821187/Loreen-Swedish-winner-of--008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=58f6f3bb1ed5c9246aad176f93ba1d19", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/5/19/1368965299685/Bonnie-Tyler-gave-a-rousi-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0f94ea863aab399d518438761be61ab", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/21/1369137332906/Russias-Dina-Garipova-per-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1f95f62e8a6e5b422cee989bbf004cf2", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Eurovision%2CEurovision+2013%2CTerry+Wogan%2CMusic%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news%2CMedia%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCulture", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/Gallery_Images/2013/5/18/1368916830566/Eurovision---winners-are--001.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c3e3a0fa24faed4c305a0bd5377b6686"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368789821187/Loreen-Swedish-winner-of--008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=be781cbfc724ebf52086be72a06d5a11", "date": "17/05/2013"}, "rank_129": {"title": "Out, out, out! Can anybody stem the Eurosceptic tide?", "text": "The Conservative party, not for the first time, is tearing itself apart over Europe. Eurosceptics have become more vocal and the PM seems unable to deal with the growing rebellion. Daniel Boffey looks at the challenge to David Cameron and talks to a leading Tory advocating a Europe exit\n\nDuring one of the rare moments when Richard Ottaway MP has attracted any attention at all, he was described as a \"blameless and inconspicuous\" Tory by a sketchwriter. The MP for Croydon South, who is due to stand down at the next election after more than 20 years' service, is not a stirrer or controversy seeker. He chairs the foreign affairs select committee and has a mild attachment to the EU because of the economic benefits he believes it brings, but his views seldom make news.\n\nSo it was a startling moment when, as Ottaway ended a short address during the Queen's speech debate last week, he was laughed at and almost jeered by his colleagues. He had made the mistake of suggesting that since he too wanted reform of the EU, he could hardly be described as a Europhile. After the kangaroo court of Eurosceptics on the Tory benches gave their mocking verdict, Ottaway told the Commons, flushed and embarrassed: \"That sort of contemptuous laugh does no good to the debate whatever.\"\n\nOttaway was suffering the kind of trashing that many minorities have experienced. And Tories even mildly sympathetic to the case for Britain's membership of the EU are in danger of becoming just that: a minority. One Tory MP has suggested that Europhilia on his party's backbenches was now \"the love that dare not speak its name\".\n\nThe parliamentary party's Europhile group, European Mainstream, has just 50 members, dwarfed by the number of antis. In less than two years, their influence within the party has been utterly undermined.\n\nIn September 2011 David Cameron told the Commons at prime minister's questions that he could not see the case for an in-out referendum. It was ruled out: Britain had had its say in 1975. Nothing doing.\n\nBut in the same month George Eustice MP, a one-time Ukip member who also stood in as Cameron's press spokesman during his leadership campaign, established a new Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs demanding a \"new relationship\" with the EU.\n\nBy May last year the editor of the activist website ConservativeHome, Tim Montgomerie, who is now comment editor at Rupert Murdoch's Times newspaper, predicted a Eurosceptic takeover was under way. Its time would come.\n\nThen in June, John Baron, the MP for Basildon and Billericay, delivered a letter to the prime minister signed by 100 MPs, calling on him to place on the statute book \"by the next general election a commitment to hold a referendum on the nature of our relationship with the EU within the next parliament\".\n\nBy January this year Cameron was announcing that he would offer such an in-out referendum should he win the next general election because the people should have their say \u2013 but only after he had secured some changes and could offer them a reformed European Union as an alternative to withdrawal. He refused to countenance legislation in the current parliament to guarantee that such a referendum would take place. Why would he, when his Lib Dem coalition partners would never sign up to it?\n\nGeoffrey Howe, the former chancellor, writing today in the Observer, puts it well: \"Having previously opposed the introduction of legislation in this parliament to hold a referendum in the next one, the prime minister suddenly allowed a free vote among backbenchers, with the government abstaining, on the extraordinary basis that the party had no policy on the issue.\n\n\"Then, once more than 100 backbenchers had voted for such a referendum, he immediately insisted that all Conservative MPs, whatever their view, should from now on support the proposal, on a three-line whip, whereas only the day before they could take any position they chose.\n\n\"This saga looks more like the politics of the French Fourth Republic than the serious practice of government.\"\n\nThe Benny Hill-style parliamentary runaround has been given added drama by the interventions of education secretary Michael Gove and defence secretary Philip Hammond, leadership hopefuls both, who have suggested that if there were a referendum tomorrow, they would vote to leave the EU.\n\nNigel Lawson, in Montgomerie's comment pages in the Times, said no matter what happened he believed we were better off out.\n\nThe extraordinary upping of the ante on the Europe question can only be understood in the context of a 2010 intake of MPS who were schooled in Eurosceptic politics under the leadership of Michael Howard and the save the pound campaigns of William Hague. Those MPs have been further radicalised by the euro crisis and the rise of the Ukip threat. So what now?\n\nSitting in his Commons office in Portcullis House, Baron, the man behind the pivotal letter of the summer of 2012, was in good spirits on Thursday. He had endured some rough and tumble with the BBC's Andrew Neil earlier in the day, but he says he quite enjoyed it. His wife maybe not so much: \"She can't see the back of me. I get out of bed in the morning, she rolls over, turns on the radio and I'm on the radio,\" he chortles.\n\nThe prime minister may be feeling the same way. Not content with filing his letter last year, it was Baron who was behind the move to force a vote condemning the Queen's speech for the lack of referendum legislation.\n\nThe prime minister's aides insist Cameron was \"very relaxed\" about that vote. Maybe. Senior backbenchers have said that at the last meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers a series of members appeared to have been encouraged by the leadership to stand up and call for unity.\n\nBaron won't comment on all that. A former captain of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, he regards himself, still, as a loyalist. \"We are reinforcing the prime minister's direction of travel,\" he says, with no little mischief. \"It's his direction of travel, as I understand it.\" He chuckles.\n\nBaron, 53, who says he has been \"a Eurosceptic all my thinking life\", would not have joined the European Community if he had been old enough to vote on it and dislikes the idea of ever closer political union.\n\n\"The British people are not into this vision thing,\" he says. \"We have a proud history. For reasons different to those on the continent, we perhaps have a bit more confidence in ourselves, I don't know. But we didn't join for ever closer political union.\n\n\"We want friendly terms, we want to co-operate on what is important. We want good trade relationships, and wish the EU all the best, but we are going to balk at ever closer political union.\"\n\nDoes he, as a loyalist, have qualms about upsetting the prime minister? \"None whatsoever,\" he shoots back. \"What I am trying to do is nudge the party closer to the electorate. That's what we have done, actually. A week is a long time in politics. A week ago we didn't have party support for any legislation, and a week ago we had no sight of a bill. Now we have got both.\n\n\"And that is progress, in my view because it more closely follows what the electorate wants.\"\n\nRecent polls show that those who want the UK to leave the EU and those who want the country to stay in are evenly matched. An Opinium/Observer poll published today suggests that more than two-thirds of voters (67%) want Cameron to \"listen and pay more attention\" to the views of his backbenchers.\n\nBut, for all that, the history books show that the electorate, when it comes to the crunch, dislikes disunity in a party. Baron received a voicemail message on his office phone on Thursday morning from a party member saying he respected the MP's position but adding: \"This has got to stop.\"\n\nAnd the party isn't just split between those who want the country to stay in and those who want to get out. They are split about the number of referendums needed, the substance of reforms the prime minister should seek before a referendum, the desirability or otherwise of legislation ensuring that there will be a referendum, and over many other arcane points that only a Conservative party which was fixated on Europe could even consider as politically significant.\n\nSo what would convince Baron to vote for the UK to stay in the EU? \"Instead of getting bogged down in detail, I say: let's see what he comes back with,\" he says. \"But, you know, he is going to be up against it. Having said that, I wish him well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, party grandees such as Lord Howe look on and despair. In comments that will chill Cameron's aides, Howe writes today: \"Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes the current terms of UK membership of the EU, the prime minister has opened a Pandora's box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the process.\n\n\"The ratchet-effect of Euroscepticism has now gone so far that the Conservative leadership is in effect running scared of its own backbenchers, let alone Ukip, having allowed deep anti-Europeanism to infect the very soul of the party.\"\n\nHowe's main concern is that the Tory party is inching, as its \"long nervous breakdown\" comes to a conclusion, towards having withdrawal from the EU as a manifesto pledge.\n\n\"The risk now is that, if it loses the next general election \u2013 a far from negligible possibility \u2013 the Conservative party will move to a position of simply opposing Britain's continued membership, with or without a referendum,\" he writes.\n\nThese are ominous words for Tory MPs such as Margot James, a rising star in the party, one of those on Cameron's A-list of parliamentary candidates in 2010 who were expected to deliver modern thinking to the party\n\n\"Nigel Lawson has asserted that the costs of the EU membership outweigh the benefits but where is the evidence?\" she asks.\n\nHowe today tries to offer a counterweight to the anti-EU cause. It remains to be seen if others will step up to the plate, risk the scorn of the antis, and make the case too.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Daniel-Boffey,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82b5c74306cbaf723065d9f0d13b419a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368892723812/Cameron-speech-on-Europe--010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5d66c819d2e510eabb8a5807056092ad", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/17/1368809567243/geoffrey-howe-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b881b0d83d000d86affbdb70ed898131", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368892723812/Cameron-speech-on-Europe--010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=043a732e5c63dc1da1cf25bf6dfbaf4c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2013/5/18/1368913004260/David-Cameron-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=246907c59b97ded4f7838f8d7f137797", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservatives%2CEuropean+Union%2CUK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29%2CBrexit%2CForeign+policy%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CTim+Montgomerie%2CMichael+Gove%2CPhilip+Hammond", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368900657188/Lord-Howe-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=38bd2695be7f0e753beb57ae1eb6e35a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/5/19/1368958822620/Lord-Mandelson-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=93dc19fbbd4765df8e33f665ca844286"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2013/5/18/1368892723812/Cameron-speech-on-Europe--010.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=043a732e5c63dc1da1cf25bf6dfbaf4c", "date": "18/05/2013"}, "rank_213": {"title": "Spot the pro-EU Tory. It's easier than you'd think | Peter Wilding", "text": "Aneurin Bevan once called Labour's lust for unilateral disarmament an \"emotional spasm\". The Conservatives' own emotional spasm, Euroscepticism, is now in its DNA. It began with Thatcher's Bruges speech in 1988, deepened with her political death in 1990 and finally entered the soul with the Maastricht rebellions in 1993. Ever since, the Conservatives have become more Europhobic with every election. It now looks like, spooked by Ukip, the party will become the first political party since 1983 to urge a British withdrawal.\n\nThis is plainly not what the prime minister wants. But, indifferent to Europe as an issue and irked by his backbenchers' nationalistic obsessions, he has moved sideways and backwards since his first Eurosceptic coup de veto in December 2011. But the line he draws around his mantra of reform, renegotiation and referendum is forever muddied. And this is why the 250 MPs and ministers who, on balance, would stay in the EU keep their counsel silent and their heads below the parapet.\n\nBut it needn't be this way. Cameron's January speech was bookended by patriotic paragraphs urging people to understand that Britain is, along with Germany, the leading player in Europe and that our power in the world is amplified through Europe as one of the key players in a world of power blocs. This is the bigger picture that, in their day, a Churchill and a Thatcher would have endlessly repeated. They were brilliant at simplifying a complex world and making Britons clear about where they stood in it. Sadly, it looks like British politicians are no longer big picture people.\n\nThe prime minister needs to further explain his theory of Britain being at risk in the global economic race. Today's Europe referendum bill is already a tool of the Europhobes. The current wording of the question is different from that proposed in the original draft, in which the question was: \"Do you think that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?\". After some lobbying by anti-Brussels MPs, it is now \"Do you think the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?\" Hey-ho, says the PM and does nothing.\n\nBut there is a fightback. European Mainstream, a group of 60 backbenchers who wrote to Cameron before his January speech urging him to focus on British leadership rather than British negativity, is growing. They are challenging the four core Europhobe arguments: that the EU costs too much, the EU is full of fraud and waste the EU is undemocratic and unaccountable, and that the UK has lost sovereignty and gained nothing in return.\n\nOn cost, Britain's net contribution to the EU was \u00a36.9bn in 2012; this compares with at least \u00a330bn, and up to \u00a390bn a year, in gain from our membership of the single market. On fraud and waste, believe it or not, the EU is subject to an auditing regime far tougher than the UK.\n\nThe age-old story that the EU has failed to sign off its accounts for years is a result of 80% of the EU's budget being spent in the member states under the supervision of their governments. The UK's comptroller and auditor-general confirmed in June 2006 that if the UK had the same system as the EU, he would have to qualify all 500 UK expenditure accounts rather than just those where he thought there was a problem (13 in 2005).\n\nOn democracy, the antis claim that 75% of the UK's laws are \"imposed by the EU\". In reality, the European Commission proposes, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament decide. The percentage of our laws deriving from our EU obligations varies from year to year but the House of Commons Library estimates it as being about 15%, not 75%. On sovereignty, the Europhobes want it back. But, if we left the EU and joined the European Economic Area, we would have saved about 20% of our current contribution to the EU budget, but would have no meaningful say over the EU laws we would be obliged to follow, and which would still be enforced by the court of justice and our own courts. Not very democratic really.\n\nAnd on red tape, the estimate made by Priti Patel MP, published on Wednesday, that EU regulations implemented over the past two years will cost \u00a35n ignores the benefits of the regulations (most of which the UK supported), gives one single figure for cost when actually the costs will be spread over many years (24 years in one case) and of course is dwarfed by the economic benefits of the single market to the UK of up to \u00a390bn a year. But the EU can and should do better in minimising red tape.\n\nBut of course the devil has all the best tunes. Because of this drip torture of Europhobic propaganda, most Britons think their country is a powerless whipping boy of a Brussels elite which steals up to 25% of our national income. It is nothing short of an insult to the intelligence of the people. As Nye Bevan said: \"Do you call this statesmanship?\" No, it is an emotional spasm. And the Conservatives are waking up to the truth that their great party is becoming Nigel Farage in drag.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373021473561/Prime-Minister-David-Came-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=975a6d3536845581a8c6f6cc6582eb96", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373021473561/Prime-Minister-David-Came-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=95e787e2de350c290ef66f899161ce01", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CBrexit%2CForeign+policy%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CConservatives%2CDavid+Cameron", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/7/5/1373021473561/Prime-Minister-David-Came-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=975a6d3536845581a8c6f6cc6582eb96", "date": "05/07/2013"}, "rank_248": {"title": "The German election results will burst Britain's Eurosceptic bubble | Jochen Hung", "text": "In spite of frequent warnings by business leaders, a majority of people in Britain currently want to leave the European Union. Even the reluctant admission by the government of the benefits of Britain's membership has not changed that much.\n\nNow, it seems, even the Germans are coming round to British Euroscepticism. Over the past two weeks, British conservatives have been in a giddy state of excitement after Angela Merkel seemed to back David Cameron's calls for a reform of the EU. Following her cautious thought experiment of \"giving back\" some powers to national governments, the Daily Mail reported that the German chancellor had apparently \"opened a secret back channel\" to the government to help with the renegotiation. After this revelation, the Telegraph added triumphantly, Labour's attempt to discredit Cameron's campaign for a new relationship with the EU \"now looks even sillier\". The Times, meanwhile, interpreted Merkel's comments as proof that a \"pan-European agreement\" over EU reform is within reach. Over at ConservativeHome, Marc Wallace was more cautious, but still welcomed the news \"on the principle that any movement in the right direction is better than nothing\".\n\nThis is not much more than wishful thinking. As always with the enigmatic chancellor, it's not clear from her comments in which direction she moved or if, indeed, she moved at all. One thing is clear, though: she will not move her country an inch from its place at the heart of the EU. While it is true that Merkel is not such a passionate proponent of the European project as Konrad Adenauer or Helmut Kohl, she is far from a Eurosceptic. She might not see the need, as her predecessors still did, to dress Germany's national interest in the EU's existence in a heart-felt declaration of European brotherhood. But she will not alter Germany's course in the European integration process. Anything else would be political suicide, because in contrast to the British, the German electorate is ardently pro-EU. A recent opinion poll showed that pro-European sentiment among Germans has actually increased over the last few years. Most surprisingly, considering the whole euro crisis, the number of people who want a return to the trusty old deutschmark is at an all-time low. According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which commissioned the survey, this trust in the single currency is the main reason why Germany's Ukip equivalent, the EU-critical Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), has performed so badly. At the moment, just over two weeks before the general election, several polls show that only about 3% would vote for the party, not enough to even make the election threshold of 5%.\n\nAccording to another survey, by the thinktank Open Europe, Germans are getting fed up with propping up their southern neighbours. But when you look more closely at the numbers, the general trust in the EU is still apparent: 60% of respondents are against a return to the deutschmark and 55% even wish for tighter political integration, as long as this does not include direct fiscal transfers.\n\nThis difference in the popular sentiment in both countries has a lot to do with the fact that in Germany, EU membership is mostly linked to memories of postwar resurgence and western reintegration, while the country's own national narrative is fraught with disaster and genocide. Britain, on the other hand, has a powerful national culture (driven home with every media report about the royal baby), while the EU raises painful notions of imperial decline. Another reason is the fact that the EU has a bad press in Britain, and I mean that quite literally: a little-known passage from the Leveson report that (ironically) has not been reported on much in the papers criticised the UK media's coverage of the EU as \"a further category of story where parts of the press appeared to prioritise the title's agenda over factual accuracy\". Examples included a headline from the Daily Telegraph claiming that children were to be banned from blowing up balloons under EU safety rules. That was, of course, downright wrong. As the Leveson report mentioned, \"there was to be no ban on balloons, merely the introduction of a requirement for balloons to carry a warning\".\n\nAs with the balloon story, the recent reports on Merkel's Eurosceptic stance were heavy on the agenda and light on accuracy. Her comments were blown up by the British media to lend some much-needed credibility to the Tory attack on the EU. I expect that as soon as the last ballot is counted in the German elections in September, she will burst these bubbles.", "images": ["https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/09/Philip_Oltermann,_L.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Germany%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CAngela+Merkel%2CEuro%2CEconomics", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/13/1379067103316/German-meat-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2e5bc494584fd2bbfc102e3932b8426", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/5/1378396180955/German-and-EU-flags-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f1e5a6d6e65743e94e62054deba29ec", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/5/1378396180955/German-and-EU-flags-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a9a896c3f80ec7815bd53ca2bdbe553a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/13/1379090938366/Bavarian-state-premier-Ho-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d579c3aa1e874aa1f036803fb6359036", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/12/1378982616110/Peter-Boenisch-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c63cf2780969898061f38e82b52430a7", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/5/1378396180955/German-and-EU-flags-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a9a896c3f80ec7815bd53ca2bdbe553a", "date": "07/09/2013"}, "rank_134": {"title": "The German elections will test David Cameron's luck | Michael White", "text": "David Cameron has been luckier than he deserves to be in his dealings with Europe's most powerful political leader. If Angela Merkel were a less pragmatic and forgiving type she would not lightly dismiss the prime minister's serial offences against good conservative Europeanism, not least his futile summit veto at the height of the eurozone crisis in December 2011.\n\nFastidious Germans of all political persuasion look on such tactics as populist pandering to growing anti-EU sentiment in Britain. They insist that their own Eurosceptic party, the Alternative for Germany (AfG) party, which hopes to enter the Bundestag at the 22 September federal elections, is not like Ukip. It merely wishes to reform the EU \u2013 notably via a smaller eurozone of virtuous northern states \u2013 not to leave it as Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader with a German wife, would.\n\nThey shudder at his latest domestic manoeuvre, the promise of a UK renegotiation in order to repatriate powers from Brussels, culminating in a high-risk referendum in 2017, a reprise of Harold Wilson's bogus renegotiation and 2-1 referendum win in 1975, but in far more hostile circumstances. Far from modernising his party as they have had to do, German MPs see Cameron as letting the Tories relapse into Thatcherite nostalgia.\n\nSo whoever wins power in Berlin this month \u2013 and experts say the result could be closer and more complex than the Merkel victory signalled in most polls \u2013 the new chancellor will not bend backwards to rescue Cameron's Berlin-style blue-orange coalition with Britain's version of the German Free Democrats (FDP). The UK's Liberal Democrats may be led by the ardently pro-EU, multilingual Nick Clegg but he seems powerless on EU policy, which has become a designated game reserve in which to feed the Tory right with red meat.\n\nDid not Cameron win the Conservative leadership in 2005 by promising to quit the 28-nation conservative EPP group at the Strasbourg parliament? Yes. And to widespread surprise, he actually did it in 2009. It was an act of self-isolation that cut the Tories off from another mainstream EU power network; not as significant as London's refusal to join the euro \u2013 few pro-EU British politicians are still brave enough to call that a mistake \u2013 but an act of ideological pique nonetheless.\n\nDespite all of the above, Germany needs Britain to stay in the EU, as a counterweight to France and a pro-austerity north European state with a globalist trading perspective and residual military and diplomatic clout \u2013 not least in Washington when EU/US trade talks are under way \u2013 that Berlin respects even as it resists Anglo-French interventionism. And Britons of all parties who are not tempted by the \"Quit Europe\" panacea know they need Germany, the EU's economic powerhouse, its paymaster and political sheet-anchor in the economic crisis that still threatens the eurozone's indebted southern flank.\n\nThe paradox of British foreign policy, after five recessionary years, is that both sides at Westminster have been forced to endorse integrationist solutions to the zone's banking and fiscal dramas that will strengthen the ascendancy of Brussels and Berlin and exacerbate the \"democratic deficit\". It is the hegemonic outcome that British policy has fought to prevent for centuries. But the alternative is worse: a collapse of the eurozone, Britain's prime market, into disorder and resurgent nationalism.\n\nOf course, Ed Miliband would like to see Merkel's SPD challenger, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, win on 22 September, or the CDU/CSU's coalition with the FDP fall apart, an event that might encourage Tory and Lib Dem splitters. On higher taxes for the wealthy, better pay for the bottom half of Germany's widening economic divide and much else, Labour and the SPD are soul brothers. A red-Green centre-left coalition could help set the tone for Labour to return to power in coalition in 2015.\n\nDream on, murmur Labour realists. The combative Steinbr\u00fcck is stuck at about 25% in most polls, his electoral base eroded by both Greens and the Linke, the kind of leftwing breakaway that British socialists such as filmmaker Ken Loach talk of but cannot make effective without reform to Britain's first-past-the-post voting system, which voters rejected in 2011.\n\nThe German arithmetic may be tight, especially if the FDP fails to reach the 5% Bundestag threshold. But with the eurozone economy at last picking up, the worst Merkel is likely to face is another grand coalition with the SPD like 2005-9. German voters like the arrangement \u2013 \"there's little difference between the two main parties now\", admits one veteran German observer \u2013 but Brits would hate it even more than they do the Lib Dem-Con coalition since 2010. No lessons there for Westminster unless (unlikely) Merkel is obliged to entreat the AfG for Bundestag votes. Nigel Farage would enjoy that.\n\nWhich way will Merkel play Cameron if she wins her third term in style? Personally, she seems to like him and his young family, playing auntie at both Chequers and its counterpart, Schloss Meseberg. Cameron reciprocates (\"a phenomenal political leader\"). Friendship, sometimes across parties, helps oil wheels. But business is business.\n\nMerkel spoke publicly in August of repatriating some powers to member states (\"we do not need to do everything in Brussels\"). It encouraged Tory MPs in the Fresh Start group of EU reformers into thinking she might be more flexible than France over Cameron's stalled \"balance of competences\" review. Merkel's briefers stress, however, that bearing down on budget costs, welfare bills (the EU has 25% of global GDP but 50% of global social spending, she repeats in many speeches) and economic inefficiency is acceptable. Re-opening existing \"ever closer union\" treaties, or repatriating employment law, are not.\n\nCan Labour profit from the trap Cameron has set himself? In the current climate, probably not. Initially opposed to a referendum on Europe, Miliband is being urged to think again or risk electoral damage among voters lazily keen to blame \"Brussels\" for Britain's woes. In a speech at Chatham House in January, his foreign affairs spokesman, Douglas Alexander, condemned Cameron's \"unilateralist\" strategy, but endorsed a leaner, more flexible vision of Europe.\n\nLike Tony Blair before him, he did not sound like a British pro-European bravely charging towards the Eurosceptic guns. The timid consensus is that there are few votes to be won by trying to make the case for Europe in the low-key and reasonable way German politicians usually do. That may have to change if Britain's place at the top EU table is to be confirmed for another generation as Wilson's 1975 referendum did.\n\nThen, Helmut Schmidt, Germany's cerebral SPD chancellor, came to London to urge a Yes vote at a special Labour conference by quoting Julius Caesar at them. \"There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood \u2026\" The time may yet come for Frau Merkel to brush up her Shakespeare. Not much chance that Mr Cameron will start quoting Schiller.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/4/1378292031880/Cameron-meets-Merkel-In-M-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=16092e77e1ff05f096b3432f1c35aa6a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/13/1379067103316/German-meat-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a2e5bc494584fd2bbfc102e3932b8426", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Germany%2CDavid+Cameron%2CPolitics%2CAngela+Merkel%2CWorld+news%2CEd+Miliband%2CBrexit%2CForeign+policy%2CEuropean+Union%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/4/1378292031880/Cameron-meets-Merkel-In-M-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bf9b5947565958a4b290919539da0e96", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/10/1378825557215/Angela-Merkel-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48cd9460fbd6e4e324c498fc7b1629ae", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/9/13/1379090938366/Bavarian-state-premier-Ho-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d579c3aa1e874aa1f036803fb6359036", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Michael-White,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e521e699b7b77d10893fb396a8c54f40", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/GU_front_gifs/2013/9/10/1378835202660/Angela-Merkel-the-German--010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ea6b34c2ec6bf5039425495ebdfaae5a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/9/4/1378292031880/Cameron-meets-Merkel-In-M-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=16092e77e1ff05f096b3432f1c35aa6a", "date": "11/09/2013"}, "rank_267": {"title": "Corrections and clarifications", "text": "\u2022 A panel that accompanied an article about the growing popularity of Eurosceptic parties in Europe was wrongly headlined Enter stage right (1 November, page 37).

At the top level of EU institutions in Brussels, there is talk of \"populists, xenophobes, extremists, fascists\" gaining around 30% of seats in the next parliament and using that platform to try to paralyse EU policy-making.\n\n\"This is a historical day. Today is the beginning of the liberation from the European elite, the monster in Brussels,\" declared Wilders after meeting Le Pen in the Dutch parliament in The Hague. \"We want to decide how we control our borders, our money, our economy, our currency.\"\n\nThe aim of the electoral alliance appears to be to form a Trojan horse in Brussels and Strasbourg: a large parliamentary caucus dedicated to wrecking the very institution that the far-right has entered. To qualify for caucus status, the new group needs at least 25 MEPs from seven countries, which they will get easily on current poll projections, although it is not clear if they can yet muster seven national parties.\n\n\"We want to give freedom back to our people,\" said Le Pen. \"Our old European nations are forced to ask the authorisation of Brussels in all circumstances, forced to submit their budget to the headmistress.\"\n\nBoth politicians are currently riding high in the polls in their own countries. A poll last month in France put the Front National at 24% ahead of the governing Socialists and the mainstream conservatives. Wilders' Freedom party, while suffering setbacks in elections last year, is currently leading in Dutch opinion polls.\n\nEurosceptic parties or those actively committed to wrecking the EU and to ditching the single currency are also expected to do well in Greece, Austria, Sweden, Denmark, Poland and elsewhere in eastern Europe, while Nigel Farage's UK Independence party is being tipped as a possible winner of European elections in Britain.\n\n\"As a result of the economic fallout from the eurozone debt crisis, populist parties on both right and left have seen and will likely realise a significant surge in their popularity,\" said analysts at the Eurasia Group. \"The crisis has provided populist and nationalist parties with an excellent opportunity to clean up and modernise their rhetoric. Political parties hitherto thought of as 'nasty' or 'racist' can no longer be considered so.\"\n\nThe pact sealed in The Hague is a big boost for Le Pen who is successfully developing a more moderate image distanced from the overt antisemitism of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, and for her campaign to form a broader \"European Alliance for Freedom\" on the nationalist right.\n\nThe effort to pool policies and campaigns has foundered in the past because the various nationalists invariably find enemies in other nations and because far-right parties tend to be dominated by leaders enjoying a cult of personality.\n\nThe aim of the Franco-Dutch alliance is to bring in Sweden's Democrats, also rising in the polls, the anti-immigration Danish People's party, Austria's Freedom party of Heinz-Christian Strache, which took more than 20% in recent national elections, and the rightwing Flemish separatists of Vlaams Belang.\n\nBy forming a new caucus in the European parliament, the group would gain access to funding, committee seats and chairs, and much more prominent chamber speaking rights. Farage, leading a caucus of 33 MEPs, has exploited the opportunity deftly to raise his European and national profile.\n\nWilders said they wanted UKIP to join, but Farage has said he will not collaborate with Le Pen because of the Front National's reputation for antisemitism.\n\nThere are also several major policy differences that Wilders and Le Pen appeared to be burying on Wednesday which are likely to resurface. Coming from the Dutch libertarian tradition, Wilders is strongly pro-Israel, pro-gay, pro-women's rights. The Front National is seen as homophobic, anti-gay marriage, and no friend of Israel.\n\nThe two big policy areas they have in common are anti-immigration and anti-EU.\n\nThey have ruled out collaborating with more overtly fascistic parties such as Golden Dawn in Greece and Jobbik in Hungary.\n\nThe attempt at a concerted campaign comes as support for the EU is haemmorhaging across Europe.\n\nGallup Europe, following polling in September, found that only 30% viewed the EU positively compared to 70% 20 years ago, and concluded that \"the European project has never in its history been as unpopular\".\n\nEven in traditionally pro-EU countries, such as Germany, support is atrophying. It remained high among older people but the 25-50 age group was split 50-50 between EU supporters and opponents. Across the EU, eurosceptics outnumbered EU-supporters by 43-40%.\n\nA new study by Mark Leonard and Jose Ignacio Torreblanca for the European Council on Foreign Relations identified five \"cleavages feeding centrifugal tendencies in the EU\".\n\nThe European elections \"will be held against a background of economic crisis and loss of confidence in Europe as a political project,\" the authors found, pointing to the possibility of a \"Tea party-like scenario\" in which eurosceptic parties capture a large quota of the seats, turn the institution into a \"self-hating parliament\" which is then \"effectively prevented from acting\".", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/30/1417357168286/Marion-Marechal-Le-Pen-at-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f3d7197a6825db147a4e46941de616b4", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+elections%2CThe+far+right%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CGeert+Wilders%2CMarine+Le+Pen%2CFrance%2CNetherlands%2CUK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29%2CEurozone+crisis", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/13/1384369612845/Far-right-leaders-Le-Pen--006.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b20973349f24a70cbac232a9f0f50288", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/19/1426783833904/aa513b1b-ed9d-46e7-b79d-1b869287acad-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2684626149e7ddffdb482ced705d64ff", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/28/1396016619775/Marine-Le-Pen-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59e35355fce89b14c45df3a2ad6942ee", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/13/1384369612845/Far-right-leaders-Le-Pen--006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ab12adf08c9a13c488a1def7e9725ea3", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801d822296be3831e5949e9cf5edc43d2163c440/301_196_1967_1181/master/1967.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b4327e1c99a6390d9b1237c862a9384a"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/11/13/1384369612845/Far-right-leaders-Le-Pen--006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ab12adf08c9a13c488a1def7e9725ea3", "date": "13/11/2013"}, "rank_42": {"title": "Where are all the leftwing Eurosceptics? | Mark Wallace", "text": "So far this week, the political news has been dominated by one issue: the European Union.\n\nA large proportion of the Tory backbenches wrote to the prime minister urging him to give parliament full control of our laws. Business for Britain, the Eurosceptic campaign group, proposed radical changes to the way single market rules were enforced. George Osborne warned Brussels that if reform was rebuffed, Britain might well vote to leave.\n\nThis has been met on the left by eye-rolling \u2013 the Tories and other obsessives are banging on about Europe again. It is treated as an eternal mystery: why are the centre-right so worried about the EU?\n\nThe question ought to be reversed: why is the modern British left so relaxed, so enthusiastic even, about a project that clashes with socialist values in principle and in practice?\n\nAs a Conservative, I disagree with many of the tenets of socialism. But we are fortunate in this country to share democratic traditions on both sides of politics. From the civil war radicals to the chartists, from Keir Hardie to George Orwell, the heritage of British leftism is a democratic one.\n\nSo why are leftwing thinkers, politicians and activists today almost universally supportive of the EU, a fundamentally undemocratic project?\n\nRun by an unelected executive-cum-civil-service, with a parliament that mostly functions only as a rubber stamp, the EU is deliberately arranged to pursue \"ever closer union\" through anti-democratic means. Even when its treaties require ratification by referendum it has a woeful record of ignoring negative responses.\n\nThere used to be a strong current of leftwing Euroscepticism in the UK, peaking with Michael Foot's commitment to leave the EEC. Trade unions and grassroots Labour supporters once rightly disliked the removal of power from the people \u2013 a route, as they saw it, to introduce capitalist policies without consent.\n\nThat democratic tradition was abandoned after Jacques Delors' speech to the TUC in 1988. He didn't make a pitch that their fears for democracy were wrong \u2013 instead, he effectively argued that Brussels' undemocratic machinery could be used to implement leftwing ideas without voters' consent. It was a shameful bargain to strike, but it was struck nonetheless.\n\nWe can disagree about whether the EU has been a socialist or capitalist influence \u2013 too much red tape or too much free market dogma, too much statist meddling or too much restriction on government deficits \u2013 but it is undeniable that it wields that influence without asking the people. Many of the outcomes of the European project ought to horrify the left, too.\n\nYears of protectionism and subsidy for well-off European farmers have hobbled developing economies and literally starved poorer competitors around the world. The idiotic common fisheries policy played a major role in the ecological disaster engulfing North Sea fish stocks. Most recently, Greece has been brutally sacrificed in order to maintain the stability of a single currency that mainly benefits far wealthier countries in northern Europe.\n\nAnd yet for some inexplicable reason the British left still embraces the EU, when by all logic and good sense they ought to be as Eurosceptic as their opponents on the right.\n\nThe prominent Eurosceptic voices today are almost universally those of the centre-right \u2013 not because it is a rightwing pursuit, but because the left has failed to uphold its own beliefs.\n\nMost on the left would disagree with Tories and Ukip-ers on immigration, taxation, workplace regulation, green policies and everything else imaginable \u2013 but it should still follow that those issues ought to be decided democratically for ourselves, not undemocratically in Brussels.\n\nWith a renegotiation of where powers lie, and an in/out referendum likely to follow in 2017, we ought to see a return of that vanished beast: the leftwing Eurosceptic.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/16/1389883070195/Michael-Foot-by-Jane-Bown-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=517d2e0c8ca2cc571a3fe3dcb9490559", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/30/1396177159729/Marine-Le-Pen-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=643f5d0cd1677de944cc8ecd6a6ec54f", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CLabour%2CPolitics%2CLiberal+Democrats%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/21/1390302929482/Alexis-Tsipras-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=28bdc6fc494092ae1f6500f633b3f0a9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2013/12/23/1387799161586/Spanish-demonstration-aga-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0d3713f0dc0804a60713119175e2a819", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/16/1389883070195/Michael-Foot-by-Jane-Bown-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=96103fa0efbb6d592ff6a95ef2369360", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/28/1398688278366/The-enemy-invasion-Brusse-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e616915d019c8a2d651b3d6bc96c1b78"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/1/16/1389883070195/Michael-Foot-by-Jane-Bown-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=96103fa0efbb6d592ff6a95ef2369360", "date": "17/01/2014"}, "rank_259": {"title": "Nick Clegg challenges Nigel Farage to live debate on Britain's EU membership", "text": "Deputy PM's challenge to Ukip leader follows warning that Lib Dems could be wiped out in May's European elections\n\nNick Clegg has challenged Nigel Farage to a live debate on Britain's membership of the European Union before May's elections.\n\nThe deputy prime minister said he wanted to go head-to-head with Ukip leader Farage as \"Ukip is the party of out, while the Lib Dems are the party of in\".\n\nIt comes after Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats' president, warned his party could be almost wiped out in the European elections this year amid a rising tide of Euroscepticism.\n\nHe warned that the party faced the fight of its life to keep its 12 MEPs as polls suggest there will be a strong vote for Labour and a surge in support for Ukip.\n\nClegg's challenge is an attempt to pick up pro-European votes from other parties, while the Tories are split on the issue and Labour's position has been criticised for lacking clarity. It will also put David Cameron in an awkward spot, as the prime minister is anxious to avoid debating with Farage on television in the runup to the general election in 2015.\n\nClegg's acceptance of the Ukip leader as a legitimate debating partner will add weight to Farage's argument that he should be allowed a platform in any television leadership debates next year.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader threw down the gauntlet to Farage on his LBC 97.3 Call Clegg radio show, where the debate could be held if the challenge is accepted.\n\nHe said: \"If Nigel Farage is either listening or looking at this programme I hope he would take up my challenge to debate, once and for all, publicly: should we be in the European Union, which I believe means that we have more people in work than would otherwise be the case, we keep ourselves safer because we can go after cross-border crime and terrorism, it means we can look after the environment in the way that we can't on our own?\n\n\"Or do we do what Ukip want, which is to pull ourselves out of the European Union and so jeopardise millions of jobs in this country? That's the choice let's have the debate out in the open and I am very happy and very keen to debate that with Nigel Farage directly.\"\n\nFarage has not yet accepted the invitation but suggested he could be more open to it if David Cameron and Ed Miliband joined in, too.\n\nA spokesman for the party said: \"Mr Farage would like to thank Mr Clegg for his kind invitation to a debate on the great issue of Britain's membership of the European Union. Perhaps he could also let us know whether he has invited David Cameron and Ed Miliband too in order that the British people can see all their main political leaders argue their positions.\n\n\"If this challenge means that Mr Clegg is going to restore his backing for an in/out referendum, which he gave before the last election but then withdrew afterwards, then it could be a significant moment in British politics.\"\n\nFarage will set out his position when he makes an appearance on LBC 97.3 on Friday morning.\n\nA spokesman for Clegg stepped up the pressure on Farage by making it clear that the offer only extended to a one-to-one debate.\n\n\"This is a simple idea \u2013 a debate between Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage,\" he said. \"While we completely disagree, both parties have a very clear position \u2013 Nick Clegg leads the party of in and Nigel Farage leads the party of out.\n\n\"There's really not very much point debating the other two \u2013 neither of them have a clear position.

It is conceivable that unless we choose to change our circumstances this September we could be dragged out of the European Union against our will.\"\n\nThere is a settled legal view among policymakers in Brussels that an independent Scotland will not automatically be an EU member, but will have to apply to join and face the prospect of lengthy and tough negotiations. That view has been eagerly seized upon by unionists and the no campaign.\n\nIn a letter to Salmond on Monday, William Hague, the foreign secretary, wrote: \"Scotland's negotiations to join the EU are likely to be complex and long and the outcome would certainly prove less advantageous than the status quo \u2026 your desire for Scotland to become an independent state which is a member of the EU within 18 months of a yes vote has been presented to voters in Scotland as a certainty. The truth is that this is far from certain.\"\n\nSalmond's visit to Bruges and Brussels was aimed at refuting this notion. He asserted that a separate Scottish state would remain an EU member.\n\n\"The Scottish government recognises that continued membership of the EU will require negotiations on the specific terms. That is only right and proper. But these negotiations will be completed within the 18-month period between a yes vote in September and achieving independence in March 2016,\" Salmond said. \"Scotland will ask for continued membership on the basis of 'continuity of effect'\".\n\nHe said it was absurd to deny the correctness of his argument.\n\n\"Five and a quarter million people ceasing to be EU citizens against their will \u2026 is more than absurd. There is simply no legal basis in the EU treaties for any such proposition. And it is against the founding principles of the European Union.\"\n\nSalmond also insisted that the new Scotland would retain the sterling currency and remain, like the rest of Britain, outside the EU's Schengen travel zone. If he is right, Scotland would be afforded special treatment that has been denied all new member states joining over the last decade.\n\nThe assertion was challenged by Hague. \"How will you convince all 28 member states to unanimously agree to grant special opt-outs to Scotland (on the euro, or membership of the Schengen area) which all recent member states have had to adopt themselves?\"\n\nThe first minister and foreign secretary also clashed over how best to represent Scottish interests in Europe.\n\n\"Scotland benefits from the UK's strong voice in Europe and the UK has a proven track record in delivering for Scottish interests in the EU,\" Hague said.\n\nSalmond, by contrast, argued that Scotland's interests in Europe had been persistently damaged by conservative governments with no mandate in Scotland.\n\n\"For more than half of my life, Scotland has been governed by parties from Westminster which could not command a majority in Scotland. That's a profound democratic deficit. It affects all areas of Scottish life,\" he said.\n\n\"Not being at the top table in Europe has harmed Scotland's interests for four decades. Within the UK, we are occasionally consulted.

Photograph: Jon Henley for the Guardian\n\nThese artisan French foods, proud produce of our terroirs and all protected by Appellation d'Origine status, will soon be at the mercy of multinationals, under the new transatlantic trade and investment partnership the European Union is negotiating with the US.\n\n\"American farmers and 'big food' will rule; our regulations and standards will count for nothing,\" Chauprade continues. \"This is an EU that has no respect for national specificities; it's an EU of bureaucrats, of ever greater normalisation, in the service of big banks and corporations. It is not the EU we want.\"\n\nUnderstandably, this message plays well here. But not only here.\n\nAcross the EU, insurgent parties from right and left are poised to cause major upset, finishing at or near the top of their respective national votes. As a result, rejectionist parties look set to send their largest contingent of anti-European MEPs ever to the European parliament: perhaps 25% of the assembly's 751 members. (Down from 766 in the current parliament.)\n\nDoes this matter? Dominated by the mainstream centre-right European People's party and centre-left Socialists & Democrats, which between them almost always muster a \"grand coalition\" of nearly 500 loyally pro-European MEPs, and with much of its work consisting of complicated compromises cosily worked out with envoys from the EU's other decision-making bodies, the European parliament does not function much like other parliaments.\n\nNor, although it now has a greater say over many more areas of EU law than before, are many European voters yet convinced of its relevance: while it supposedly represents some 500 million people, voter turnout among the 28 member states has fallen steadily since the first ever elections in 1979, when 62% of the electorate turned out, to just 43% at the latest vote in 2009.\n\nBut the near-certain election in a few weeks of a very substantial minority of MEPs actively working to derail, or at the very least disrupt, the parliament's work passing EU laws could come to be seen as something of a defining moment in the European project.\n\n\"I think,\" says Juri Mykk\u00e4nen, a political scientist at Helsinki University, \"that there is a lot of potential for these elections to become some kind of turning point for Europe, in large part because of the populist parties. I think the established pro-European parties are going to have to start listening. This has to be seen as a signal that for a lot of people in Europe, the European Union has gone far enough in this direction.\"\n\nNational sovereignty\n\n\n\nMykk\u00e4nen's home country is a good case in point. Nervously sharing an 800-mile border with Russia, Finland had more reason to join the EU than most when it made the leap in 1995.\n\n\"For us, the EU actually offered a better chance of national sovereignty,\" Mykk\u00e4nen says. \"That's a big deal for us: we've only had it since 1917. Except it has been a false promise. Then there's the financial crisis, having to pay for other people's mistakes \u2026 Support for the EU is falling.\"\n\nCapitalising on that growing sense of disillusion is the Finns party. In national elections in 2011, stealing votes from right and left, the Finns' fiscally leftwing but socially conservative and unashamedly nationalist platform \u2013 it supports the welfare state and marriage, and strongly opposes immigration \u2013 saw it capture nearly 40 seats in the Finnish parliament. Currently polling at about 18%, it could field up to a quarter of Finland's 13 MEPs.\n\n\"There's a vicious circle in the EU,\" says Jussi Halla-aho, one of its leading MPs and a European parliament candidate MEP, in a striking brick-and-glass annex of the Helsinki parliament. \"Integration creates problems, so more integration is proposed to solve them.\"\n\nNot that Europe is altogether \"a hopeless case\", he adds, his words chosen carefully. \"It has tools and instruments that bring added value to everyone. I accept its existence. But it has to focus on the functions that are beneficial for everyone \u2026 and not on political integration. Political integration, in my view, does not serve the interests of the nation states that make the union.\"\n\nFreedom party (PVV) leader Geert Wilders. Photograph: Michael Kooren/Reuters\n\nIf the Finns party is polling high on its anti-EU ticket, others are doing even better. The Front National, on about 24%, seems comfortably on course to win at least 20 of France's 74 seats. Nigel Farage's europhobic Ukip, which according to the most recent poll enjoys more than 30% support from those who say they will definitely vote, should also finish top or a close second, and seize a similar number of the UK's 73 seats.\n\nIn Denmark the anti-immigrant Danish People's party is ahead on 27%; Austria's Freedom party (FPO), which campaigns against \"Islamisation\", is on track for 20% of the vote; Geert Wilders' anti-EU, anti-Islam Freedom party (PVV) was leading in the Netherlands until its controversial founder triggered a public backlash \u2013 and several resignations \u2013 by publicly egging on people chanting against Moroccan immigrants. It could yet bounce back.\n\nBut anti-EU sentiment is not solely the preserve of the xenophobic, the nationalist, or even the somewhat socially conservative right. True, if parties such as the Front National are making strenuous efforts to ditch their past (and its young, highly qualified and personable candidates have now made the party most popular in France among 18- to 24-year-old voters), some anti-Europeans remain indelibly nasty.\n\nWith 18 seats in the Greek parliament, Golden Dawn may reject the neo-Nazi label, but its emblem bears a strong resemblance to the swastika, its leaders are prone to giving Nazi salutes, and six of its MPs are in jail accused of using the party to run a criminal gang.\n\nSimilarly, Hungary's Jobbik, which took 20% of the vote in April's general elections, may prefer the term \"radical nationalist\", but its ideology is so freighted with antisemitism, racism and homophobia that far-right groups in western Europe, including the Front National and the PVV, steer well clear.\n\nAs the continent struggles to emerge from its economic crisis, distrust and disillusion with Brussels are now fuelled by more than the spectres that have traditionally haunted the more thuggish elements of Europe's far right.\n\nTo older fears about loss of sovereignty, mass immigration and (more recently) the rise of Islam have been added an equally potent anger about bitter austerity, rampant unemployment and inequality \u2013 a cocktail that means contemporary Euroscepticism is alive across the political spectrum.\n\nThese Euro-insurgents appeal to people unsure about their own future, worried about where their country is going and whether they belong there, and doubtful that mainstream parties can or will do anything about it. With little sign of any real fall in unemployment or serious economic recovery, that's a lot of people.\n\nDisillusion with the EU, certainly, is at record highs across the continent. The surveys are unequivocal: 60% of Europeans \"tend not to trust\" the EU now, against 32% in 2007; in 20 of the 28 member states a clear majority feels the EU is going \"in the wrong direction\"; for the first time, Eurosceptics outnumber supporters by 43% to 40%.\n\n\"In our analysis, the real turning point came in the late 1980s, when the big industrialists started laying down the plans for the future of Europe,\" says Dennis de Jong, a leading MEP from the impeccably leftwing but fiercely Euro-critical Dutch Socialist party. \"Until that moment, the EU seemed like a logical post-war development. But industry, not ordinary people, has driven much of what's happened since, from opening internal borders to the euro. This EU \u2013 the EU of multinationals, of harmonisation \u2013 makes people uneasy. People like difference. They like identity.\"\n\nComing from a polar ideological opposite, the words bear a striking similarity to those used by the Front National. But left and right see eye to eye, too, in their verdict on Brussels.\n\nSocialist De Jong says: \"Power is concentrated there, and it is growing all the time \u2013 like every bureaucracy, Brussels feeds itself. And so every problem has to have a European solution.\"\n\nAnd this is the Front National's Chauprade: \"It's the bureaucrat's dream: a completely uniform, formatted Europe. Never mind that the EU was founded on the idea of subsidiarity, of no one telling anyone else what to do. It's hard for them to admit \u2013 they've devoted their lives to building it. But this EU is not serving its citizens.\"\n\nBeppe Grillo, leader of the anti-euro Five Star Movement in Italy. Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSimilar views prevail on the radical left in Greece, where Syriza could finish top of the European poll. The party has yet to translate into concrete European policies the fiercely anti-EU, anti-austerity message that made it the largest party in the Greek parliament in 2012, but it is unlikely that the eight or nine MEPs it could have will feel particularly warmly towards the European commission.\n\nIn Italy, too, comedian Beppe Grillo's anti-establishment, anti-corruption and anti-euro Five Star Movement, consistently polling above 20%, could easily capture up to 20 of the country's 73 European parliament seats. It has promised to wade in and \"shake up\" Brussels.\n\n\"What we mean by that,\" explains Manlio di Stefano, a Five Star MP, \"is that the EU has to return to its original concept. Not a union but a community, based on principles of solidarity and dignity. We are saying that we must renegotiate the Europe we have, or we cannot stay. We cannot exchange our people's dignity for an agreement to stay in Europe.\"\n\nPerhaps most remarkably of all, pretty much the same anti-EU song \u2013 set to an only slightly different tune \u2013 is now being sung even in Germany.\n\nIn a cavernous conference centre on the outskirts of the handsome east German town of Erfurt last month, some 1,500 people gathered for the congress of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland. Formed barely a year ago by a mild-mannered professor of macroeconomics at Hamburg University, Germany's newest political organisation does not pull your usual protest-party crowd: there are college lecturers, lawyers, doctors, judges, academics, company directors. More than 70% have never been members of a political party before.\n\n\"We are the revolt of the reasonable people,\" says Frauke Petry, chemist, businesswoman and an AfD spokesperson. \"We'd like to get back to the basics of the community. We think the EU has lost sight of its fundamental freedoms, with this never-ending harmonisation \u2013 for which Germans fear they will end up paying.\" (Germans have no problem with Greek civil servants wanting to retire at 50, she adds, as long as they do not have to meet the cost.)\n\nLoss of identity\n\n\n\nThere's more, and it sounds quite familiar. \"We think the commission is pulling more and more rights to Brussels,\" Petry says. \"We think that while Germans are very, very patient, they are starting to feel they are losing their identity. And although that is naturally rather a sensitive subject in Germany, they don't like it. We think it's wrong that there are subjects \u2013 Europe, immigration controls, national responsibility \u2013 that cannot be discussed in Germany, because it is not acceptable.\"\n\nAs a party founded by an economist, though, Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland \u2013 which is now looking at up to 10 seats in the European parliament \u2013 thinks above all that something has to be done about the euro. \"It is clearly harming Europe,\" says J\u00f6rg Meuthen, an economics professor from Kehl and European parliament candidate. \"In this party we are about facts, evidence, reason. Not ideologies. And the clear facts, we have to face it, are that while the common market is a success story \u2013 it works, it has increased prosperity, it has brought us together \u2013 the common currency is precisely the reverse. It does not work. It has reduced prosperity. It is pushing us apart.\"\n\nNigel Farage, leader of Ukip, which wants Britain to walk away from the EU. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nOne of AfD's democratically chosen slogans, says another candidate, Dirk Driesang, is \"less EU, more Europe\". \"Solidarity is important,\" he says. \"But on Greece, the EU showed solidarity with the banks, not with the Greek people. The euro's a problem that can't be fixed. It's political will trying to trump economic reality.\"\n\nOn this, almost all the insurgents agree: FN, Finns, AfD, Five Star, Dutch Socialists \u2013 the euro, they argue, has been a disaster. \"As an experiment, it's been a catastrophe,\" says Ludovic de Danne, European affairs adviser to Marine Le Pen. The currency is \"structurally unstable\", says De Jong.\n\n\"We quite clearly should not be in the same currency as Greece, Italy and Spain,\" says Halla-aho. \"It is not based on financial realities. It was a nice idea to think the euro would push countries like Greece to raise their game, but it hasn't happened. And the euro is far too strong now for Finland, which depends almost entirely on exports.\"\n\nWhere they fail to agree, however, is on what to do about it. The Front National would like France out the euro, and to hell with the consequences. The Dutch Socialists want \"serious and open discussions, among all member states, about how to dissolve it in an orderly manner\".\n\nAfD quite likes the sound of a smaller, northern eurozone, made up for example of Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Finland. The Finns think some countries should leave, but aren't sure yet who: the southern states, or themselves.\n\nDivisions over the common currency are mirrored in other equally fundamental areas. Ukip, for instance, wants Britain to simply walk away from the EU, regardless; the FN and PVV would go the same way given half a chance; AfD and the Finns see their own countries' exits as unthinkable, even suicidal, urging \u2013 like many continental sceptics \u2013 structural reform and the rebuilding of a kind of enhanced, free-trade community of sovereign states instead.\n\nSeveral anti-Brussels parties, including the Front National and the Dutch Socialists, propose denying the unelected and \u2013 as they see it \u2013 centralising, ultra-liberal, bought-up and sold-out commission the right to initiate legislation, giving it instead to MEPs and the Council of Ministers representing national governments. Many, too, want a more flexible union, with member states able to say no to specific measures.\n\nOn other issues they face fundamental disagreements. Questions around immigration, \"Islamification\" and identity politics are no-go areas for many: Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders may recently have agreed to form a continental anti-European alliance aimed at wrecking the EU from within, and other hardline nationalists such as Italy's Lega Nord, Austria's FPO, Vlaams Belang in Belgium and the Swedish Democrats may well join them, but more moderate parties will not go near.\n\n\"Wilders and Le Pen are simply out of the picture for the Finns,\" says Sakari Puisto, a young academic standing for the party in Tampere, in central Finland. \"We could not envisage allying ourselves with neo-fascists. Or with communists, for that matter.\"\n\nUnity against EU\n\n\n\nDe Jong says his party \"will not engage with anyone proposing discriminatory policies, wanting to create tensions on the grounds of race or religion\". Farage has said that while he admires Le Pen's drive to decontaminate her party, the whiff of historic antisemitism that still hangs over it rules out any formal co-operation with Ukip.\n\nUnfortunately, formal co-operation is important in the European parliament: forming a political group, which needs 25 MEPs from seven states, qualifies its members for offices and funding \u2013 as well as, crucially for any party pushing for change, a say in what gets debated in the parliament's plenary session, the right to table motions for resolutions and chair parliamentary committees, and extra speaking time in the chamber.\n\nWill the insurgents manage to overcome their differences long enough to form an effective opposition to the pro-integration behemoths of centre-right and centre-left \u2013 to become, in effect, a kind of European Tea Party, paralysing the European parliament in much the same way as ultra-conservative Republicans have paralysed Washington?\n\nWhile all stress \"flexibility\" and willingness to co-operate with anyone who shares a specific view, few can imagine Syriza ever sitting down with the FPO, AfD with Jobbik, or Ukip with the PVV. Most EU observers seem to think the Wilders-Le Pen group stands a fair chance of hanging together, however, and the current Europe of Freedom and Democracy group \u2013 which includes Ukip \u2013 will almost certainly re-form with new and different members. The radical left, too, should comfortably form a group.\n\nA demonstrator burns an EU flag in Nicosia, Cyprus. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhether that will be enough for the rebels to seriously challenge the status quo is another matter. \"At the end of the day,\" points out Hugh Bronson, an AfD candidate, \"even if the combined anti-Brussels forces \u2013 I don't like to say Eurosceptic, we're not all anti-EU, just anti this particular EU \u2013 even if we manage 25 or 30% of seats, the Christian and Social Democrats will still have 70%. It could just be business as usual; same old, same old \u2026\"\n\nSome observers feel the anti\u2013EU parties' best chance of really influencing debate over the coming years is at a national level.\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of this is in Britain, where Ukip, despite not having a single seat in Westminster, has parlayed a string of strong byelection performances and the winning media persona of its hail-fellow-well-met leader into real political gain, pushing David Cameron into pledging a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU and rushing through measures to reduce \"unwanted\" EU immigration in the form of so-called \"benefit tourism\".\n\nBut in the Netherlands, too, Wilders' anti-Europeanism has contributed to growing Dutch dislike of austerity and secured clampdowns on immigration and asylum-seekers, while in France the Front National, after a carefully planned and efficiently implemented local campaign that targeted winnable town halls and concentrated more on policy credibility than outraged protest, has both the ruling Socialists and the opposition UMP running scared.\n\nEven in Finland, notes Halla-aho with the satisfaction of a man who has got at least some of what he wants, \"the best way to make a politician act in a certain way is to make him fear the results of the next election\".\n\nIt is at the heart of Europe, though, that these parties want to make their mark. \"I really hope the established parties listen after this shock; they really have to,\" says Di Stefano of the Five Star Movement. \"The fact that so many political parties, of such wildly differing ideologies, now share such a fundamentally similar analysis of where the European Union is failing \u2013 that, surely, is a measure of how far things have gone wrong. It's going to have to change.\"\n\nAnd if Brussels does not listen, the rebels believe, there will, eventually and inevitably, be an explosion violent enough to blow the whole European construct to pieces. \"If we are ignored,\" says the Dutch socialist De Jong, \"then in five years' time, our voice will be even louder. People will be even more angry and frustrated.\"\n\nBack in Coulommiers, Chauprade's European affairs adviser, Adrien Mexis, 33, a lecturer in European law at the prestigious Sciences Po in Paris, former staffer at the European commission in Brussels, and newly elected Front National local councillor, is harsher still.\n\n\"I spent six years in Brussels,\" he says, \"where we were supposed to be defending the interests of the people of Europe. Instead, we defended the interests of the lobbyists, big industrial groups and multinationals.

Unfortunately, the main political beneficiary is likely to be the Eurosceptic right, and even the extreme right. The left is failing to capitalise on the wave of popular frustration, mostly because it has no progressive Eurosceptic agenda to offer.\n\nThat is not to say that the left has no radical solutions for the ills afflicting Europe. It rejects the fiscal austerity that is devastating both economic activity and the welfare state; it advocates policies to reduce unemployment, particularly among the young; it favours redistributing income and wealth to confront inequality; it proposes controls over the financial system, one of the main culprits of the current malaise; it backs an investment drive to boost productive capacity and to rebalance the European economy.\n\nThe trouble is that the left refuses to acknowledge what is increasingly obvious to working people across Europe: these radical policies are impossible within the institutions of the EU. The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 ensured that the EU is run by privileged bureaucrats setting policy in the interests of big business, including deregulating markets and protecting finance. The European Monetary Union and the common currency launched in 1999 have created a rigid framework of permanent austerity, as well as Brussels- and Frankfurt-based controls over national economic policy. The eurozone crisis, far from changing things for the better, has actually hardened the conservative mechanisms at the heart of the EU.\n\nThe common currency has also made the EU more hierarchical, with a small core and several peripheries. At the top of the hierarchy sits Germany, currently enjoying unprecedented power across the continent, both within and without the eurozone. Strikingly, German workers have not benefited from this extraordinary development, since their own incomes have remained frozen, or risen very slowly, thus allowing German big business to dominate markets. The greatest loser is France, outcompeted by Germany within the eurozone, with poor growth prospects, large deficits, and its welfare system under strain. The future position of Britain in the new alignment of economic and political power in Europe is far from clear.\n\nAs the EU has hardened, its decision-making has become more undemocratic and even anti-democratic. In dealing with the eurozone crisis, for instance, the EU imposed unelected governments in both Italy and Greece, while forcibly denying the Greek people the right to hold a referendum on whether to accept their \"rescue\". The sense of powerlessness and loss of democratic rights among voters is well-justified.\n\nMoreover, immigration policy has been a shambles. On the one hand, the free movement of labour within the EU, without basic institutions to support workers in receiving countries, was never going to be a smooth affair in a continent comprising so many different languages and cultures. On the other, the \"fortress Europe\" policy of keeping out the unwanted masses of Africa and Asia has turned southern countries into a regular battleground, with immigrants held in camps in desperate conditions.\n\nThis potent mix of economic failure and big business favouritism now threatens to boost the extreme right as nationalist and racist ghosts have reappeared in Europe. The left should seek to counter this prospect, but not by calling for strengthened European integration in the hope of creating a \"better\" EU. The institutional mechanisms of the EU are too far gone to be reformed. They have to be dismantled and replaced. The left should, rather, voice the frustration of working people by sending a clear anti-capitalist message that combines radical policies with progressive Euroscepticism. Two steps are vital in this regard.\n\nThe first is to accept that the eurozone has failed irretrievably. Maintaining the common currency through political force and against all sense is actually throttling the economic life of Europe. Individual countries ought to be offered a cooperative exit option. The eurozone as a whole ought to be replaced by a system of managed exchange rates and controlled capital flows, thus avoiding a return to damaging competitive devaluations among nations.\n\nThe second is to realise that a single European state, whether federal or unitary, is neither feasible nor desirable. The fundamental reason is that there is no single European \"demos\". Indeed, the eurozone crisis has shown that the mechanisms of the nation state can offer some protection against heavy encroachment by big business using EU mechanisms. The left ought to stress that the future of Europe is one of democratic cooperation among its peoples on the basis of equality.\n\nThe coming Euro elections are likely to deliver a hefty jolt to European politics. If the left heeds the message and develops a progressive Euroscepticism, things might begin to improve in Europe.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/7/1399455306865/Anti-austerity-protests-i-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=abea8f4720c5be55912bab1aee65ade2", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEuropean+elections%2CEurozone+crisis%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+monetary+union%2CEconomics%2CBanking%2CEuropean+banks%2CFinancial+crisis%2CFinancial+sector%2CEuro%2CEurope%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CEconomic+policy%2CPolitics", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/7/1399455306865/Anti-austerity-protests-i-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e24df3691b3af4a49c4fd05073b4eeaa"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/7/1399455306865/Anti-austerity-protests-i-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=abea8f4720c5be55912bab1aee65ade2", "date": "07/05/2014"}, "rank_51": {"title": "The UK and the European Union: a very British love-hate affair | Analysis", "text": "A British Labour MP recalls taking some trade union colleagues to Brussels to show them how the EU's core institutions work. Being British they were sceptical and suspicious, but once they got stuck into the finer points of health and safety legislation, where MEPs strive hard to protect workers, their attitudes changed to one of enthusiasm for what the 766-strong parliament might achieve for them.\n\nHealth and safety rules are rarely popular except among those whose lives they have changed. But the story could be repeated across a host of sectors and interests where British citizens benefit from what \"Brussels\" and \"Strasbourg\" do for them \u2013 from cleaner beaches and ice cream made from cream not pig fat (a famous early example) to current battles over mobile phone roaming charges and other clashes with tax-nimble global corporations that states hesitate to take on.\n\nIt does not make much difference. As with the blue and gold flag adorning regional infrastructure projects Brussels has helped to fund, the UK's public's response is rarely generous and reflects the relentless pounding the EU takes from most of the British press. When the Daily Mail enthusiastically promotes a European parliament report or decision it agrees with that does not prevent it returning to the attack on the adjoining page.\n\nIt was ever thus. Though militantly anti-EU Tory MEPs such as Dan Hannam, let alone Ukip's Nigel Farage, love to claim democratic liberty as a British invention they noisily despise Europe's earnest attempt over the 50 years since the original assembly became a \"parliament\" (directly elected since 1979 after UK pressure too) to acquire real powers that shape policy and call the EU bureaucracy to account as \"Europe's soap box\" on behalf of 375 million voters.\n\nIt has not been for want of trying. Back in 1975 when Labour's Harold Wilson staged the last EU referendum to keep his divided cabinet intact, Helmut Schmidt, then German chancellor, addressed a special Labour conference at Westminster in beautiful English and flattering terms (\"There is a tide in the affairs of men,\" he said, quoting Shakespeare's Julius Caesar). Come and join us to build a social democracy, he asked.\n\nConference and party voted no. The pro-Europeans (they included Margaret Thatcher) won the referendum by 2-1 and it took Labour another decade (and a pro-EU split by the SDP faction) to reverse its hostility to the \"capitalist\" project under Neil Kinnock, later an EU commissioner. This time the inspiration was a mixture: fear of free-market Thatcherism at home and admiration for the vision of the French socialist president of the commission, Jacques Delors, the only Euro-pol to become a household name. Labour has remained pro-EU ever since, its gone-native MEPs often more integrationist than agnostics at home. Only the Lib Dems and Greens have been consistent Europhiles.\n\nBy the time of Labour's late 80s conversion, the Tories had swung the other way, despite Thatcher signing the highly integrationist Single European Act of 1986. It eventually cost her the premiership and has hobbled her party ever since. Appeasing Europhobia by promising to quit the conservative European People's party (EPP) faction as \"too federalist\" clinched the Tory leadership for David Cameron in 2005. He has tried to walk a tightrope ever since: renegotiate the UK's terms and stay in is his position, as it was Wilson's in 1975. But the Ukip albatross grows bigger by the year and may destroy his career.\n\nThroughout the protracted UK love-hate affair with Europe, surely the legacy of a different history (Britain and Sweden are the only EU member states not occupied by foreign armies and/or domestic dictatorship in the 20th century), the parliament has usually been a sideshow, an easy target for tabloid mockery over its extravagance, the Brussels-to-Strasbourg \"gravy train,\" the expenses and pensions, the folly of some reforms, the eccentricity of some MEPs (not least the British).\n\nAt any given time there are usually about 10 former MPs, politicians who lost their Westminster seat but love the trade and found another platform. Few have ever been major figures or become them, though ex-MEP Nick Clegg is a rare, if accidental, exception. In old age Labour's former cabinet veteran, the charismatic Barbara Castle, was once an (unelected) MEP and Strasbourg star, a pattern more common elsewhere in Europe. For Britain even appointing an EU commissioner is too often seen as somewhere to park an inconvenient Westminster colleague, not as a chance to augment British influence.\n\nLittle wonder that turnout for European parliamentary elections has remained tepid, though at 34.7% in 2009 the UK's record is slightly better than at the first direct elections (32.35%) in 1979. Elsewhere it has tailed off badly, below 50% since 1999, 43% last time. The pan-EU recession \u2013 and the embrace of austerity to address it \u2013 have only served to promote a nationalist backlash in many states, large and small. Its impact may be significant in the newly elected parliament.\n\nThat too will reflect a form of British influence that is at the heart of the paradox of Britain's relationship with Europe since the second world war. Having called for European integration in the ruins of disastrous wars, but initially stayed aloof itself, London allowed France to shape the EU institutions and Germany's economic power to dominate them.\n\nYet from globalised free markets and democratic accountability to the tone of judgments from European courts, British instincts have often prevailed over the bureaucrats and the autocrats. In the past decade, the British have even managed to export their own corrosive and comically short-sighted form of Euroscepticism .\n\nWhat an irony if Nigel Farage MEP, a boozy metal trader from the under-regulated City of London, proved to be Britain's last, toxic contribution to the project.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+commission%2CEurope%2CEuropean+elections%2CPolitics%2CNick+Clegg%2CDavid+Cameron%2CNigel+Farage%2CLabour%2CMargaret+Thatcher%2CNeil+Kinnock%2CHarold+Wilson", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/7/1399501144024/European-parliament--011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=627d8d285c15a1902ba7e8a9b4a06115", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399503902657/Margaret-Thatcher-and-Ed--011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=990df1e1a009d4fe61cefe3fa1d032b7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/7/1399468258321/european-commission-rival-010.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7f3dcb1d7af13bb73ed129d5dc216832", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399503902657/Margaret-Thatcher-and-Ed--011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48fb27593eb42e76475652eb19fbbbf9", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399550104271/Green-party-vote-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=914ea9c1ec07122f03e7b9d4a5984615", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399551518173/Martin-Shulz-Jean-Claude--011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e1d2379c8b60697acfc1620ab85cf61"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/8/1399503902657/Margaret-Thatcher-and-Ed--011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=990df1e1a009d4fe61cefe3fa1d032b7", "date": "08/05/2014"}, "rank_211": {"title": "EU timeline: from destruction to steelmaking \u2026 to meltdown", "text": "From the ashes of war\u2026\n\nIn 1945 western Europe was a scene of devastation after almost six years of world war. French foreign minister Robert Schuman and diplomat Jean Monnet drove the formation of the European Coal and Steel Community, a proto-common market overseen by a supranational authority. The aim was to bind the states together economically, ensuring that war was \"not only unthinkable but materially impossible\". A treaty was signed in 1951 by France, West Germany, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nA common market\n\nIn 1957 the same six countries signed the Treaty of Rome, creating a common market in labour, capital, goods and services. A Common Agricultural Policy was created in 1962. As the democracies of western Europe (bar the UK) deepened their ties, a standoff grew with the Soviet bloc of countries in the east. The Berlin Wall, a symbol of the communist east and capitalist west divide, was built in 1961.\n\nStreet warfare\n\nIn Brussels, the customs union came into force ahead of schedule, but progress on integration was overshadowed by events elsewhere. The generation whose parents had fought in the second world war took to the streets of Paris, Rome and West Berlin in 1968, calling for greater democracy, an end to the Vietnam war and a more libertarian, egalitarian society. Meanwhile, Soviet tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia to crush the Prague Spring.\n\nThe oil shock\n\nThe decision by Arab Opec countries to restrict the supply of oil in 1973, dramatically forcing up the price for western consumers, signalled the end of the long postwar economic boom in Europe. In Britain, the end result was the notorious winter of discontent, which heralded the election of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister in 1979. Stagflation and debt galvanised the EEC member states, by now including Britain, to ratify the Single European Act in 1986, to try to boost competitiveness and economic growth. The era of \"harmonisation\" \u2013 and endless \"straight banana\" stories in UK newspapers \u2013 was born.\n\nThe handbag era\n\nThatcher's implacable opposition to the idea of \"ever-greater union\" launched the modern era of Conservative Euroscepticism. She also fought tooth and nail to secure a British rebate from the EU budget in 1984, relishing her portrayal as a flinty housewife type determined to hang onto her money. But Thatcher was a devotee of the single market and enlargement of the Union to the east, both of which were to become major features of the EU. Since the 1980s, Eurosceptic Conservatives have become progressively more radical in their rejection of the EU, leading David Cameron to offer a referendum on membership in 2017, if he is re-elected.\n\nThe Berlin Wall falls\n\nIn 1989 east and west Berliners demolished the barrier which had divided the city for nearly 50 years. It signalled the end of the cold war and a revolution in the affairs of the EU. Within a year Germany was reunified, making it the most powerful, populous nation in the EU. By 1991 the Soviet Union had collapsed. Over the next 20 years the EU would almost double in size as eastern enlargement took place at breakneck speed.\n\nThe euro is launched\n\n1 January 1999 was the biggest red-letter day in the history of EU integration since the Treaty of Rome. The launch of a single European currency, the euro, was heralded by supporters as a spur to growth across the eurozone. Britain stayed out, as did Sweden and Denmark, but a commitment to join up is a condition for any new EU member. Currently 18 member states use the euro, which is the second-biggest reserve currency in the world.\n\nAfter the crash\n\nSince the crash of 2008-09, the economic governance of the euro has come under severe criticism, as the absence of a common banking system and mutualised debt left member states at the mercy of financial markets. The sovereign debt crisis and consequent policies of austerity have led to steep recessions in Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and elsewhere. The traumatic period has led to calls for greater fiscal and political union as eurosceptic sentiment has surged across the continent, along with a resurgence of nationalism.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/10/1399744775307/Flags-of-European-Union-m-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60d814635769f65c88ee329271930cc9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/5/11/1399813088358/David-Cameron-talks-EU-re-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6394c61128396a87a8ba9bb2832b32f4", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CFrance%2CGermany%2CEuro%2CAusterity%2CBusiness%2CMargaret+Thatcher%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+elections", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/9/1399671165885/Tattered-EU-flag-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d19bc3ace01d3387e1dc18d12e5dd57", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/12/1399889563887/David-Cameron-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fbffea7dd060702e35177dbe0bc04336", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/5/10/1399739146167/Treaty-of-Rome-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b8b68ffc3464f402dbcf8a1d22023b3", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/5/10/1399739146167/Treaty-of-Rome-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57661923def18a8994aa951d4efb0059"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2014/5/10/1399739146167/Treaty-of-Rome-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b8b68ffc3464f402dbcf8a1d22023b3", "date": "10/05/2014"}, "rank_206": {"title": "What can save the European Union?", "text": "The EU was designed to bind a continent together in peace. It transformed Europe politically and economically, but now critics rage at waste, austerity economics and a democratic deficit. Ahead of European elections,travels to Italy, France and Belgium to find out: is the postwar dream over?\n\nEntering the central courtyard of the European parliament in Strasbourg, the visitor is surrounded by a collection of giant larger-than-life posters from which smiling faces gaze out. One striking, bohemian-looking couple catch the eye. \"On 22 May,\" reads the legend above their black fedora hats, \"Jens and Sedsel will choose who's in charge in Europe. And you?\" Below their feet is the slogan: \"European elections 22 May 2014. Act. React. Impact.\"\n\nPerhaps the Strasbourg assembly should be careful what it wishes for. Jens and Sedsel may be signed up to the programme. But across the continent, those who may not have the best interests of the European Union at heart are marching on the parliament, from both the right and left of the political spectrum. The insurgents are certainly looking to \"act, react and impact\", but not in the way that the designers of the Strasbourg posters may have hoped.\n\nIn Britain, Ukip's Nigel Farage, pint in hand, has already pulled British politics to a place close to the EU exit door. But euroscepticism is no longer a curiosity of these islands. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's Front National, has even grander designs than Farage. Le Pen plans to use the forthcoming elections to form an alliance dedicated to wrecking the \"monster in Brussels\" from within. Her party is on course to top the polls in France.\n\nIn Italy, an ex-comic, Beppe Grillo, whose anti-establishment shtick has its origins in the anarchic left, ridicules the recent succession of Italian prime ministers who have \"become the slaves of financial interests and economic decisions taken elsewhere\". The Five-Star movement which he founded in 2007 is second in Italy's polls, predicted to win 25% of the vote. The Greek socialists of Syriza are riding high from Athens to Alexandroupoli on the back of a promise to roll back crushing EU-imposed debt repayments.\n\nEven in the land of Borgen, where consensus politics provided an unlikely template for cult television viewing, rebellion is in the air. The Danish People's party \u2013 anti-EU, anti-multiculturalism and anti-immigration \u2013 is pledging to \"assert Denmark's independence and to guarantee the freedom of the Danish people in their own country\". The DPP, which like Ukip has profited from popular resentment at the extension of welfare benefits to immigrant workers, sits in first place in the polls, also with a share of 25%. In the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, and across much of eastern Europe, it is a similar story.\n\nTwo weeks from the elections, it seems possible \u2013 probable even \u2013 that Eurosceptic parties could gain up to a third of the total vote and up to 200 of the 751 seats in the next European parliament. Given that less than half of the Union's electorate are likely to vote at all, those figures suggest an overwhelming majority of Europeans are either apathetic towards the ongoing project of a common borderless European home or actively hostile. Never mind Jens and Sedsel. If they were still among us, Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, Altiero Spinelli, founding fathers all of the EU, might be wondering: \"How did Europe lose its way?\"\n\nLeft behind in the 'global race'\n\nEU officials in search of an answer could do worse than travel to Forbach in the region of Lorraine, at the historic core of the union. A former mining town, Forbach was there at the birth of the European dream, one of the dynamos of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) brought into being after the war by victorious France and defeated Germany\n\nThe ECSC, proposed by Robert Schuman, the French foreign minister at the time, and inspired by the visionary French diplomat Jean Monnet, was created in 1951 by Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The unprecedented pooling of sovereignty over vital resources was a statement of intent: the western half of a devastated continent was determined that the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45 should never be repeated. By 1957 the ECSC had morphed into the European Economic Community, or Common Market, and the road to the European Union had begun. But six decades on, blue-collar Forbach is no longer a showcase for the federal dreams of Schuman and Monnet. In fact, it's about to vote heavily for the self-styled patriots of the FN.\n\nThe last mine here closed in 2004 and nothing much has taken its place as France has been gripped by economic stagnation and austerity following the crash of 2009. At the well-funded Mus\u00e9e les Mineurs, newsreels from the postwar glory days are shown on a constant loop. A narrator in 1947 asks: \"How could the miners not feel proud of what they represent? The reconstruction of France!\" But in the Forbach of 2014 unemployment stands at 14% and is far higher among the young. Vandalism and car-burning is common in the town's bleak suburbs, where refugees and migrants now occupy the postwar estates built for generations of miners. Shops, cafes, even the last bookshop, have disappeared. The town is dying.\n\nThe sorry tale of decline is repeated in industrial and manufacturing towns across the EU, where the economic crisis of the last five years has finished off communities that were already losing their place in the new global economic order. China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam are where the new Forbachs are to be found. Ageing, economically insecure and fearful for the future, more and more Europeans are listening to populist calls for retrenchment behind old borders and old certainties. A generosity of spirit towards the outsider is being replaced by an embittered \"welfare chauvinism\", and an insistence that French, Danish, Austrian or British workers come first.\n\nIn March's mayoral elections in Forbach, the FN's plausible vice-president, Florian Philippot, won the first round of voting, before losing narrowly in the runoff against the incumbent Socialist, Laurent Kalinowski. In the European poll Philippot is all but certain to become an MEP for the region, elected on a platform of reinstituting border controls, withdrawal from the euro and French jobs for French workers.\n\nA graduate of the elite \u00c9cole Nationale d'Administration, the breeding ground for France's political elite, Philippot represents a new generation of FN politician, which came of age during \"La Crise\". A youthful, articulate 35-year-old, he is a far cry from the motley crew of neo-fascists who used to assemble under the banner of Jean-Marie Le Pen. Philippot's political hero is General Charles de Gaulle.\n\n\"The surge in support for the FN is a protest vote, a cry of pain,\" says Jean-Claude Flauss, a retired archivist and local historian. \"What is being done to this town is shameful. A population, having been exploited, is now being left to rot; a community is in the process of being dismantled. And a place which gave so much, which gave so many resources and so much wealth, is being abandoned to its fate.\"\n\nFlauss insists that xenophobia is not behind the local support for Philippot, although he says the decision to place hundreds of refugees in the town's struggling suburbs has been \"a problem to add to all the others\". In the \"global race\" constantly invoked by Europe's politicians, Forbach feels ignored, forgotten and left behind.\n\n\"The people of Forbach are not racist,\" says Flauss. \"This has always been a place that welcomed strangers. In the 1920s it was the Italians who came. They fled Mussolini to come and work in the mines. They arrived with helmets in their hands, ready to work. In the 1930s it was the Polish. After the war, workers arrived from the Maghreb. This is a place with a history of openness and tolerance. No one really thinks withdrawing from the euro would be practical. Over 100,000 people cross the borders around here to work. But it's not hard to see why the FN would want to implant themselves in the town. People are desperate and want to show the world they are very, very fed up.\"\n\nEmil Dolic's father was one of those foreigners who came to work in the local pit, fleeing Tito's Yugoslavia in 1958. Dolic himself worked down Forbach's mine for 25 years, having grown up in the suburb of Behren-les-Forbach, where last month disaffected youth attacked the mayor's offices and the town was woken up by circling police helicopters. He thinks Philippot is a \"good man \u2013 not like Jean-Marie Le Pen who was just crazy\", but cannot bring himself to vote FN. But he is deeply pessimistic about the future of the country that gave his father a new start: \"The Chinese can do everything more cheaply now and they don't have the welfare costs to worry about. We can't compete with them. When people are vulnerable and suffering, that's when the FN can exploit the situation.\"\n\nThroughout the region, Marine Le Pen's party is doing just that. In nearby Hayange, the famous Florange steelworks closed a year ago when the Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal took his investment elsewhere. An FN mayor \u2013 a former radical socialist \u2013 has just been elected there.\n\nNationalism reborn?\n\nAt the Front National's annual May Day parade in Paris, the talk is of France's latest industrial embarrassment: the potential sale of another \"national champion\", the energy and transport giant Alstom, to America's General Electric. Lorraine loyalists are out in force. The favoured chant of the day is \"On est chez nous!\" (\"We are in our own home!\") which reverberates through a marching crowd drawn from Provence, Franche-Comt\u00e9, Burgundy and beyond. The slogan is an angry assertion of what should be the case but isn't, as open markets and cheap labour from eastern Europe allegedly cut a swath through traditional French life.\n\nAmong the ancient flags of Brittany and the Vend\u00e9e and the fleur-de-lis which is a traditional symbol of French royalism, other banners ram home more contemporary points: \"Europe is our prison!\", \"- EU and + France\", \"They toast each other in Brussels at our expense!\"\n\nWalking past the Palais Royal, a new chant goes up: \"Ni gauche ni droite: Front National!\" (\"Neither left nor right: Front National.\") Thierry Gaulot, a newly elected FN council member for Metz, around 35 miles from Forbach, insists that this is no longer about the old preoccupations of the French royalist right. In its efforts to break through, the FN has gone ecumenical, both at home and abroad, where it hopes to become the standard-bearer of a new \"Europe des Peuples\".\n\n\"This is now a party that is based on a patriotism that can appeal to the left as much as the right,\" Gaulot says. \"There are plenty who have joined us from parties of the left. Nigel Farage says we are antisemitic? People who talk about racism or fascism are just not opening their minds. Listen to that chant, 'on est chez nous'. It's about sovereignty; about the global economy being run on the terms of the multinationals who can up sticks to go where they can make more profit.\"\n\nWhen Marine Le Pen appears to speak in the Place de l'Op\u00e9ra, she is dressed in marine blue. Behind her is a backdrop depicting a giant Joan of Arc, blowing away the yellow stars of the European Union flag. Le Pen has big ambitions for these elections, hoping to use the Eurosceptic surge across the continent to form an \"enemy within\" the European parliament, in alliance with the Dutch far-right Freedom party leader, Geert Wilders. To form a \"European Freedom Alliance\" in Strasbourg, she and Wilders will require a minimum of 25 MEPs from seven member states. Up to now, Farage has insisted that Ukip will not be joining. But the Austrian Freedom party and Vlaams Belang, the Flemish nationalist party, both appear to be on board. The Danish People's party and Italy's Northern League are also allies. Judging by the current polls, the threshold of 25 MEPs will be easily crossed.\n\nOnce installed, the alliance will become an awkward, obstructionist presence, committed, in the words of the Northern League's Matteo Salvini, to \"a different Europe, based on work and peoples and not in the one based on servitude to the euro and banks, ready to let us die from immigration and unemployment\".\n\nIn Paris, in a Wagnerian downpour, Le Pen laments the betrayal of France. She inveighs against the \"gravediggers\" of Brussels, whose austerity measures are held responsible for the scourge of mass unemployment and economic stagnation. France's new Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, is denounced for introducing a new round of cuts \u2013 \u20ac11bn from welfare payments, \u20ac10bn from healthcare \u2013 in order to lower France's budget deficit to satisfy the European commission. \"Manuel Valls has no idea how to govern France,\" Le Pen tells the crowd. \"The destiny of this country is being decided in Brussels.\" President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is little more than \"the little governor of the province of France\".\n\nAt the same time, she says, mass immigration, attributed to the EU's \"ultra-liberalism\", is undermining the nation's sense of identity. Immigrants must accommodate to French culture, not the other way round. \"The French people no longer control anything: banks, money, borders.\" The coming EU-US trade deal is an invitation to American farmers to put their French equivalents out of business.\n\n\"States have a lot in common with human beings,\" Le Pen concludes. \"A state which controls nothing becomes a depressed state.\" As the microphone conks out in the deluge, she joins the crowd in an impromptu mass rendition of La Marseillaise. Then there is one final message for Brussels: \"In other countries, other peoples are rallying to our side. We want to build a Europe of free and sovereign nations. A Europe of peoples.\"\n\nA strange kind of democracy\n\nIt was an early 19th-century utopian socialist who first dreamed up the idea of a European parliament. As the continent suffered the ravages of the Napoleonic wars, Henri de Saint-Simon pleaded for the creation of an elite assembly to run the continent along less sanguinary lines. The body would be attended by 21 \"delegates of humanity\" \u2013 a council of experts selected in England, France, Germany and Italy. \"As soon as elections have been held to the Supreme Council and to the Councils of individual nations\", wrote Saint-Simon, \"the scourge of war will be banished from Europe.\"\n\nThe modest dimensions of that original vision now seem somewhat quaint. Directly elected since 1979, the EU's parliament is a Goliath among the world's democratic fora. In two weeks' time, 750 MEPs and one president will be elected to represent an estimated electorate of 501 million people in 28 countries. However, the ways of the EP have provided some open goals to its critics.\n\nThe parliament has no tax-raising powers but rewards its representatives with a notoriously handsome package of salaries, expenses and grants. There is little obligation to furnish receipts. And Farage, recently embarrassed over the hiring of his German wife as a secretary, is not the only MEP to discover that a seat in the European parliament can become a family concern.\n\nGood ideas at the time have become expensive anomalies. In recognition of the historic reconciliation between France and Germany after the second world war, MEPs still trek once a month from Brussels to the parliament's official seat in Strasbourg, at a cost of \u20ac180m a year. Acknowledging that such needless expense is meat and drink to enemies of the European idea, MEPs led by the parliament's vice-president, Edward McMillan-Scott, have launched a \"Single Seat\" campaign to abandon \"Alcatraz\", as the Strasbourg building is known to some of its inmates. But such gripes are small beer compared to the biggest problem for the parliament: a continuing lack of credibility among the electorates of Europe.\n\nThe two major groupings in the assembly, the centre-right European People's party (EPP) and centre-left Socialists and Democrats (PES) have little purchase on voters who tend, when they vote at all, to use the quinquennial polls as an opportunity to sound off at domestic governments.\n\nMEPs have no power to initiate legislation, which is the unelected European commission's job.\n\nDuring the three-year melodrama of the eurozone crisis, they were concerned bystanders as the \"troika\", composed of the commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, imposed an eye-watering level of austerity in bailed-out and indebted member states such as Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, where youth unemployment rates have soared above 50% in some regions.\n\nEndlessly, parliamentarians have battled for a greater say, recently gaining new legal powers over immigration and policing. And they did eventually show their teeth over the troika, releasing a highly critical report in March. MEPs' support was also crucial in establishing a eurozone banking union designed to avoid taxpayer bailouts of banks in the future.\n\nBut if the EU's elected body could not directly determine policy during the biggest crisis in the union's history, some might ask, what is the point of it?\n\nThe steady decline in poll turnout, from 63% in 1979 to a miserable 43% five years ago, suggests a growing number of potential voters have come to the conclusion that there isn't one. Among the under-25s in 2009, the abstention rate was a damning and surely unsustainable 71%. As the European Freedom Alliance of Le Pen and Wilders prepares to embark on a wrecking mission in the parliament, it feels like a turning-point in the history of a much-lampooned institution.\n\n\"Somehow we need to create a European Demos, a European consciousness,\" says Anni Podimata, a Greek socialist who belongs to the centre-left grouping. \"At a national level we need to explain properly the challenges and benefits of Europe.\" But how?\n\nSearching for the great leap forward\n\nHow about the first-ever European presidential debates? Last month citizens of Maastricht out for a stroll were treated to an unusual sight in the town's main square. In front of the Vrijthof theatre, a modest crowd was assembled, soon to be scattered by the arrival of a dark blue coach. Emblazoned across the front of vehicle in huge white letters was the single word \"Juncker\". This was the campaign battlebus of Jean-Claude Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg and EPP candidate for the plum role of European commission president.\n\nAs the much-discussed \"democratic deficit\" at the heart of the EU has become a crisis in the age of austerity, the debates are an attempt at a bailout. Or, as the Brussels-sponsored Debating Europe website puts it: \"The European Union is run by unelected bureaucrats right? Well it's not so simple \u2026 for the first time ever the European parliament will be putting forward candidates for position of the European commission president, giving citizens a real say in who runs the EU's executive arm.\"\n\nThere are six candidates, including Martin Schulz of the PES, the liberal Guy Verhofstadt and, presumably hoping to cause trouble, Alexis Tsipras, the socialist scourge of Brussels-inspired cuts in Greece. The winner will be the candidate whose parliamentary group secures the most votes later this month.\n\nWho knew? Certainly not the average Labour voter, because Ed Miliband has run a mile from Schulz, whose federalist vision of the EU's future goes way beyond the pale for British consumption in the Ukip era. Labour dissociated the party from Schulz's campaign, saying: \"Martin Schulz's political priorities in Europe do not represent those of the Labour party. While not being able to support the PES common candidate for this year's election, we continue to support the principle of having common candidates.\"\n\nThe day after the debate, Guy Verhofstadt is in a chipper mood. Once the enfant terrible of politics in Belgium, where he was a youthful prime minister for nine years, the polls show him as the clear winner of the evening. \"It's great that this is taking place,\" he says. \"It's never happened in 20 years. For the first time a democratic European debate is emerging on the future of Europe.\"\n\nVerhofstadt is a founding member of the Spinelli Group, named after the dissident Italian communist who, during the second world war, produced a manifesto for a federal union across the European continent. Founded in 2010, the group calls for a revival of \"the European spirit\". But Verhofstadt admits that the union has an image problem. \"What is it? Is it a confederation or a federation. Is it intergovernmental, or is it communitarian. Is it a group of 6, 9, 12, 15, 17 or more? Who is in the Schengen agreement [to abolish internal borders] and who isn't? Who is in the euro and who isn't? Who is opting out of that and who is opting into this? It's overly complex.\"\n\nFor Verhofstadt, the mop-haired bespectacled face of radical federalism for over a decade, there is, however, no going back. A driver of vintage racing cars for a hobby, he believes that only a future United States of Europe can compete in the global race with China, India and the other emerging economies of Asia. If places such as Forbach are to thrive in the 21st century, \"you have to reinvent the idea of sovereignty\".\n\n\"It's no answer for nation states to retreat behind their own borders,\" he continues. \"The eurosceptics have no solutions, just scapegoats. Take energy. America has a common energy policy and they are net exporters. Europe has 28 different energy policies. That gives America a competitive advantage. Show me the person who will say, 'I want to hold onto national sovereignty even if it means higher prices.'\"\n\nWhen it comes to the great austerity plan, he insists there was no alternative. The cost of borrowing in heavily indebted countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy had become unsustainable. \"Budget discipline was necessary and debts had to come down,\" says Verhofstadt. But the savage consequences of the cuts could and should have been mitigated by more solidarity between states at EU level. \"The Eurosceptics are right that the crisis has been badly handled. Austerity has been dictating policy, but we need to think about growth as well. We should be pooling the debt of eurozone states above 60% and we're not doing it\".\n\nThe future must be about deeper integration. \"It's not about a superstate. It's about more integration as the engine of growth, unified capital markets, a unified banking system, common debt in the eurozone. There's no credit union in the EU, so it's difficult to get credit in another country. That's crazy.\"\n\nFor those content that the eurozone should remain at the halfway house of a single currency with national markets, he has a dire prediction: \"If in the end you don't fully integrate, then you may as well stop with the currency. And that would lead to the decline of Europe. The Europeans would not be able to compete with China and India.\"\n\nWill anyone listen to Verhofstadt's warning? It is true that the history of EU integration is punctuated by crises that have not gone to waste. The horror of the second world war led to the founding of the Coal and Steel Community. The collapse of communism in eastern Europe saw the EU expand eastwards at breakneck speed. But in the Europe of 2014, evangelists of a United States of Europe will have to fight even to get a hearing. Alongside the resurgent nationalism on view in the northern capitals of London, Paris, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, new anti-politics movements are on the rise in the south, born out of frustration with all '\"political elites\", whether national or European.\n\nSend in the clowns\n\nBeppe Grillo has been described as \"the most dangerous man in Europe\" by the German magazine Der Spiegel. The rebarbative Italian comic took that as a compliment. For over a year, this satirist-turned-populist firebrand has been laying waste to the traditional landscape of Italian politics. Piazzas have filled from Sicily to Turin, as crowds have gathered to hear messianic calls for a new grassroots, web-based, democratic culture, and a bonfire of the vanities of Italy's corrupt political caste. Opponents accuse Grillo of a facile moralism and unappealing vulgarity \u2013 his rise began in earnest with the organisation of \"Fuck Off Day\" in 2007, which outed the numerous Italian parliamentarians carrying previous convictions. The comic's fierce hostility to organised political parties has even been compared to Mussolini's attacks on parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn February last year, Grillo's Five Star Movement \u2013 a loose network of local groups organised online around his own blog \u2013 gained an astonishing 26% of the vote at the Italian election. \"Send in the clowns,\" ironised the Economist. This year the 65-year-old is taking on Brussels, wrapping himself \u2013 literally \u2013 in the EU flag and touring the country performing a vituperative one-man show entitled Te lo do io l'Europa (\"I'll give you Europe\").\n\nItalians used to be the biggest Europe enthusiasts, seeing Brussels as a means of escape from the dysfunction of the state that gave the world Silvio Berlusconi. But the Europe described by Grillo to his audiences shares the DNA of the \"eurocracy\" presented to French voters by Marine Le Pen: anti-democratic and, in its pursuit of austerity, economically ruinous.\n\nAccording to Grillo, from the moment the unelected former European commissioner Mario Monti was appointed prime minister of Italy in 2011, in the midst of the country's sovereign debt crisis, Brussels has controlled Italy's economic destiny. \"It's not a mystery,\" Grillo writes in his blog, \"that (national) governments are created and destroyed in Brussels. It's happened in Greece, in Portugal, and it's happening in Italy. Three Italian governments have been decided by the EU. We need to go into Europe to change Italy. Our prime ministers have become servants of financial interests and economic strategies decided elsewhere.\" The Five Star Movement is calling for a referendum on membership of the euro and an immediate end to the \"fiscal compact\" designed to ensure budget discipline in indebted EU states.\n\nIf the Five Star Movement can gain 20-30 seats in the Strasbourg parliament, Grillo reckons that \"the current balance of power will be turned upside down\". Polls suggest that, at around 25% of the vote, his candidates are on course to reach that target.\n\nGrillo's MEPs will never join the nationalist front run by Le Pen and Wilders, but their presence in the parliament will open up another flank of dissent. While Europe's nationalist right is attempting to disinter the nation-state and relive the glory days of the postwar boom, the Five Star Movement has more in common with the anarchic radicalism of the Spanish indignados or the Occupy movement. The anger is representative of a generation of young Europeans who face lower living standards than their parents and little chance of finding a meaningful job.\n\nIn Ascoli Piceno, where Massimo Tamburri is standing as a mayoral candidate for the Five Star Movement, the youth unemployment rate is 47%. \"The young are just condemned to stay with their families,\" he says. \"There is just huge frustration. I have friends who have been in a relationship for five or six years but they still live with their parents.\"\n\nRome, says Tamburri, isn't working, and neither is Brussels as presently constituted. \"It's not a community. It's not got an egalitarian politics. The only positive things \u2013 and they're not enough \u2013 are initiatives like the Erasmus student exchange programme and free movement within the union.\"\n\nThe celebrated satirist and Nobel prize winner Dario Fo \u2013 at 88 one of the grand old men of Italian culture \u2013 is one of Grillo's most impassioned supporters. Fo has spent a lifetime on the turbulent left of Italian politics, arguing with the fanatics of the Red Brigades in the 1970s and satirising the right in plays such as Chain Me Up and I'll Still Smash Everything. Now he says: \"I'm not on the left. I'm a democrat.\"\n\nDisillusioned with the broken promises and clientelism of mainstream parties, the cardinal virtues for Fo have become \"civic commitment\" and \"honesty\". At his summer home on the Adriatic coast, surrounded by his own paintings and photographs of his late wife, Franca Rame, he has been hosting political discussion groups on where the Five Star Movement goes next.\n\n\"I had a very lively meeting here yesterday,\" he says. \"Fifty or so people came here, young men and women from Rimini, Ravenna, Cesena, and we talked about where we should go with this movement in which so much has happened so quickly\".\n\n\"The Five Star Movement is the only means of climbing out of the pit,\" says Fo, \"the only way of leaving behind the hypocrisy and the swindling in politics. In the eurozone crisis we know that there was speculation and that the banks were saved by the governments of various states. In Italy we've now had three governments without elections, and this was not a clean process. We were told that everyone had to make sacrifices to save our nation and then we see that it's the usual mugs who pay up: workers, small businessmen, students and pensioners and so on.\"\n\nFo backs the Five Star Movement's call for a referendum on the euro. \"I don't know how I would vote in it. I would reflect for a while,\" he says. \"But let's see what the referendum result would actually be, if it's positive or negative. Let's have some democracy here rather than have everything done behind closed doors.\"\n\nAs cultural grandees such as Fo bemoan the current state of \"the project\" along with thousands of younger activists an urgent defence may be required.\n\nThere are signs that one may be coming.\n\nWho will stand up for 'Europe'?\n\nHerman Van Rompuy, a man whose very name seems to provoke mirth in anglocentric circles, is known for composing the occasional haiku. But the Belgian president of the European Council \u2013 the intergovernmental apex of the EU \u2013 generally has the reputation of being the driest of dry sticks. To coincide with the coming elections, however, he has published a passionate defence of Europe and all, or most, of its works.\n\nIn Europe in the storm: Lessons and Challenges, Van Rompuy writes: \"Even the eurosceptic voters don't want to return to the past. Who wants to go back to the old times, to the customs frontiers that existed before 1954? How many people really want to return to national currencies, after the crisis of the euro? Very few!\n\n\"People know very well that not only is there an added value, but also that Europe can never disappear again from their way of life. People have criticised, here and there, abuses linked to the free movement of people. But in the context of the whole acquis [accumulated legislation], that's ridiculous! The cost of no Europe would be enormous!\"\n\nComplacency or common sense? There is no doubt that \"Europe\", overwhelmingly, has been a force for good in the world, from the securing of the postwar peace, to the promotion of human rights, to the simple freedoms that allow a European to drive a car from Milan to Brussels without stopping at a single checkpoint.\n\nOutside its borders, as the rush of post-communist states to join the EU demonstrated, Europe is usually seen as an attractive model of democratic decency. In an interview with the Belgian paper Le Soir, Van Rompuy noted: \"In Africa \u2026 Europe is perceived as the homeland of democracy. The colonial Europe has been forgotten. There is a new Europe which is the biggest donor of development aid and which intervenes militarily only to help. What was our self-interest in intervening in the Central African Republic? None. We mustn't lose sight of this.\"\n\nBut even Van Rompuy would admit that recent post-crash history, to put it mildly, has soured the mood. In Brussels, as economic growth slowly returns, there is hope that spirits may lighten. One senior EU official, now retired but an influence in the commission's glory days under Jacques Delors, says: \"I can see it now. The commission will be saying, 'O ye of little faith. It was unpopular, but austerity has worked. We're on the right track.'\"\n\nPerhaps. But the damage of the last few years has been colossal, as testified to by those extraordinary youth unemployment rates in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain. And the challenge of preserving European living standards as the continent's population ages, and the world's centre of economic gravity shifts east, is immense.\n\nEver the optimist, Verhofstadt is already preparing for the fightback after this month's elections. \"This month,\" he says, \"you will see a kind of victory for the Eurosceptics. But that will hopefully lead to the emergence of a pro-European electorate and eventually to the new leap forward that we need.\"\n\nWelcome to the dialectics of hope, EU-style. But as Europeans, or some of them, go to the polls this month, it will be a long time before anyone in Brussels can echo with confidence the famous injunction of Jean Monnet: \"Continue, continue, there is no future for the people of Europe other than in union.\"", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/16/1400264229190/An-Ethnic-Kosovo-Albanian-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a278ce1a24e5eb3a92c54e0bec67f24d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/19/1400510993181/Merkel-and-Hollande-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=46c9742306d0b28bb507bfe2025232df", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/9/1399671165885/Tattered-EU-flag-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d19bc3ace01d3387e1dc18d12e5dd57", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/12/1399889563887/David-Cameron-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fbffea7dd060702e35177dbe0bc04336", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/9/1399671165885/Tattered-EU-flag-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ce461784bc2b9e2801b0d485180b60b7", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/21/1400698871819/Jean-Claude-Juncker-of-th-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=385ee228df3ebee2cbe3ce8c325926a4", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CEuropean+elections%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CFrance%2CBeppe+Grillo%2CMarine+Le+Pen%2CGeert+Wilders%2CUK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29%2CPolitics%2CEuro%2CEconomics%2CEuro%2CEuropean+monetary+union%2CBusiness%2CEuropean+commission%2CAusterity%2CGuy+Verhofstadt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/9/1399671165885/Tattered-EU-flag-008.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ce461784bc2b9e2801b0d485180b60b7", "date": "10/05/2014"}, "rank_212": {"title": "Nigel Farage: Euroscepticism will continue to grow - video", "text": "Nigel Farage discusses the results of the European elections on Tuesday, saying the broad base of EU opposition cannot be ignored.

Think again. France is now more committed to loathing the European Union than Perfidious Albion: it has indeed become the new stronghold of Euroscepticism. Last week, the EU election results were like none other before. For the first time since the end of the second world war, an extreme rightwing party topped a national poll.\n\nDo not be fooled by Marine Le Pen's down-to-earth demeanour. She may dispense with her father's antisemitic puns or Islamophobic tirades, but under her leadership the Front National remains an extreme rightwing party; the party which was launched by Marshall P\u00e9tain's apologists and French Algeria supporters in 1972.\n\nHow could France, one of the six founding members of the EEC and traditionally a proud architect of European integration, end up with such a state of affairs? On election night the already beleaguered prime minister Manuel Valls described the results as an \"earthquake\". Yet the FN's victory was anything but a surprise.\n\nOpinion polls had long registered that the public have an increasingly negative perception of the EU. A Pew Research Center survey carried out in May 2013 showed that more and more French voters believed that \"membership of the EU is a bad thing\". Only 41% had a \"good opinion\" of the EU, as against 43% in Britain. (In 2012, 60% of French viewed the EU favourably.) The question of further economic integration turns out to be the most contentious issue: only 22% French people support it, compared with 36% in 2012.\n\nFrance's Euroscepticism ought to be qualified as it differs from the British brand. Bar the FN and Debout la R\u00e9publique (a neo-Gaullist micro-party), there are no self-professed Eurosceptic parties in the French political landscape. From the radical left (Left Front) to the conservative UMP, all main parties are officially dedicated to European integration. On the far left, in the Parti Socialiste, in the Green Party and on the conservative right, some still support a federal Europe. The mainstream media and business also pay lip service to the European cause.\n\nBritish Euroscepticism has traditionally been of a \"hard' type. It implies a fundamental opposition to the idea of political and economic integration and expresses itself as a principled objection to the current form of integration in the EU on the grounds that it offends deeply held values, such as national sovereignty. In contrast, \"soft\" Euroscepticism involves contingent or qualified opposition to European integration and may express itself in terms of opposition to specific policies or in terms of the defence of the national interest.\n\nHowever radical its public expression may be today, French Euroscepticism belongs to the \"soft\" category. It is not a principled opposition to the EU or the pursuit of integration, but it is essentially an objection to the nature of policies being implemented by EU institutions. It is also a protest against the decision-making process in the communitarian bodies. In principle, the FN does not object to France being a member of the EU and it does not advocate leaving the Union altogether either.\n\nThe French are feeling increasingly disillusioned when it comes to the EU because they regard it as promoting an aggressive brand of free-market economics. Far from protecting them from economic competition and social dumping \u2013 a race to the bottom in which employers reduce wages and employees' benefits in order to attract and retain investment \u2013 the EU is seen as an entity that undermines the French concept of what should be a European \"good life\". This concept is associated with solidarity, economic equality and a pro-active welfare state. What is more, the EU has dramatically failed to deliver on jobs and economic growth. France has currently 5.9 million unemployed, taking into account all categories, and 10 million people live on less than \u20ac900 per month. Rightly or wrongly, the public believe that the EU is as responsible as the French government for downgrading their living conditions.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Jacques Delors had tirelessly promoted the cause of a \"social Europe\". Mitterrand had urged the public to back a more \"market-friendly\" Europe, promising that France's partners would in turn concede elements of political and social integration to create a Europe of the people. Voters obliged, although reluctantly \u2013 the Maastricht Treaty was only approved by a narrow majority of votes in 1992. At the time, the seeds of discontent were starting to take root.\n\nThe referendum on the European Constitutional Treaty in 2005 was a turning point. After a passionate public campaign which had politicised large sections of the population, the French rejected the constitution by a resounding majority. One clause in the treaty concentrated the French resistance to it: the promotion of \"free and unfettered competition\" between member states. This proposition was seen in France as the prelude to ever more social dumping. The result was exceptional given that the whole French establishment had called for a yes vote. Two years later, heads of governments ratified the Lisbon Treaty, a repackaged version of the constitution. This time, the people were not consulted. Nicolas Sarkozy candidly acknowledged he could not let the French vote the \"wrong way\" again.\n\nThe 2014 European campaign in France was nothing like the British one. The FN, the most Eurosceptic party, hardly campaigned on immigration. It instead focused on the question of the euro. Opposition to the euro offered Le Pen an important element of demarcation since no other major party was officially against it. This stand allowed the FN to come across as more radical than the UMP, the Parti Socialiste and the establishment. She was also able to capture the mood of the nation far better than her rivals as support for FRexit [France exiting the Euro] is now gaining momentum.\n\nThe Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership was also debated during the French campaign. According to its critics, the purpose of Tafta [Transatlantic Free Trade Area] is to remove the regulatory differences between the US and EU member states. The agreement would grant big business the power to sue governments which try to defend their citizens. It would allow secretive panels of lawyers to overrule the will of national parliaments and annihilate governments' legal protections. The FN singled out Tafta, describing it as an \"ultraliberal, anti-democratic, anti-economic and antisocial war machine\".\n\nA recent Ifop poll shows that a growing minority of French people see the euro as an obstacle to prosperity and even to peace in Europe. The idea that France should abandon the euro so as to resolve its current economic crisis has been gaining momentum over the past year. Mainstream economists are adopting an anti-euro stand. Critics argue that the euro was supposed to create a space of protection against globalisation. But by preventing devaluation, the single currency has resulted in a maximised zone of economic confrontation between member states. Thus leaving the euro would mean a return to peace. The euro was presented to the people as an economic panacea, but it has in fact accentuated disparities between member states and ruined southern Europe while securing the exports of northern member states, notably Germany.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Hollande is accused on the left of having chosen to safeguard the currency and of sacrificing sectors of the French industry, making thousands of workers redundant. Some fear that a debate on the euro would strengthen the FN and encourage further demands for a return to national sovereignty, a theme which is increasingly popular across various categories of voters. Aur\u00e9lien Bernier, a leftwing author, argues that Le Pen's success is partly due to the fact that there is no actual challenge to the euro from the left.\n\nHer victory can be explained by several factors: the rightwing neo-liberal policies of Hollande, the inability of the Left Front to offer a plausible alternative to Hollande's policies and the cases of corruption involving several UMP leaders. Ordinary people, the \"left behind\" of the economic recession, want, therefore, to protest and inflict the maximum damage to establishment parties by voting for the FN. Alexis Tsipras, the leader of leftwing party Syriza, has recently declared: \"Austerity has led to the creation of political monstrosities such as Nigel Farage's Ukip.\" There is no doubt that Marine Le Pen's Front National and French Euroscepticism prosper on the political cynicism and ineptitude of President Hollande and of mainstream parties.\n\nPhilippe Marli\u00e8re is Professor of French and European Politics, University College, London", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Europe%2CFrance%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+elections%2CEuropean+Union%2CPolitics", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/31/1401553092339/French-far-right-Front-Na-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=06b6298c2b1ef87d8de9a3b038bc53f8", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/31/1401553092339/French-far-right-Front-Na-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=14ea29be1378bfd468f4b5933fde299a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/31/1401553092339/French-far-right-Front-Na-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=14ea29be1378bfd468f4b5933fde299a", "date": "01/06/2014"}, "rank_101": {"title": "Trapped between Ukip and the EU, Cameron plays a risky game | Simon Jenkins", "text": "European politics could be getting interesting. Tony Blair will today bid to lead a \"new\" Europe with a speech drenched in cliches about \"wake-up calls\". David Cameron, meanwhile, threatens to bring forward a UK referendum on the EU if Germany's Angela Merkel fails to reject Jean-Claude Juncker as EU president. In response to this, Juncker has accused Cameron of blackmail.\n\nThe riskiest game is Cameron's. Every political leader's primary duty is to survive, and he is trapped between the anti-EU wing of his Conservative party with Ukip snapping at its heels, and an EU establishment with no more enthusiasm for change than is any supranational association.\n\nEurope has always called Britain's bluff on a referendum, relying on the convention that only a parliamentary vote is needed for a new treaty to proceed. Cameron unwisely broke a promise to hold a referendum during this parliament, opening his flank to attack from Ukip. All British political parties now accept either an early referendum on EU membership or at least one on any treaty change. That is the clear message of last month's European elections. Cameron's pledge is to hold a referendum in 2017, but if Juncker is selected as president he may bring it forward. It is becoming clear that Britain, like Scotland, is on the brink of a collective decision about its constitutional future. The outcome in both cases is that things cannot continue as before.\n\nMerkel does not want to be the German leader who presided over the partial disintegration of the EU, nor do most EU leaders wish to see its balance shift from the rich north and poor south by Britain's defection. Cameron has a reputation for indecision and wavering but he appears to have put his leadership on the line as a champion of Euroscepticism. He does not mean to go down fighting for the EU against his own party.\n\nThis is surely the start of a new power play in Europe. Merkel has her own Eurosceptic wing. Cameron is demanding her determination to support root-and-branch reform, on pain of British public opinion running wild for the exit. That is why her decision on Juncker is about more than the fate of one veteran Luxembourg politician.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Simon-Jenkins,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1137fea1af60259ffbbc3908b7ab7419", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/2/1401718812560/David-Cameron-makes-a-spe-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1c5ccd712bbbe9a9f70111a9f9af1512", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/2/1401702425685/Tony-Blair-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=538d25feeee33699fa1e01faea182afd", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2014/6/2/1401714809378/Tony-Blair-addresses-the--011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=75487b578f178bc148854fd7cdec0372", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/2/1401699141778/David-Cameron-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=cb54ece92525151f5b6008ae53062f90", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/2/1401699141778/David-Cameron-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e99fb8932da456a3b18113df69b1afdf", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+commission%2CDavid+Cameron%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news%2CAngela+Merkel%2CLuxembourg%2CForeign+policy%2CUK+news%2CTony+Blair%2CUK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29%2CJean-Claude+Juncker", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/8/1402239894399/People-hold-a-giant-Europ-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e62c7bf98f6a69f2e21f9c21b849fe72", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/2/1401699141778/David-Cameron-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=e99fb8932da456a3b18113df69b1afdf", "date": "02/06/2014"}, "rank_254": {"title": "Syriza can be the future for Greece, and for Europe too | Costas Douzinas", "text": "The Syriza victory in the May European elections was historic \u2013 it is the first time the radical left has won in Greece \u2013 and the celebrations of party supporters outside Athens University lasted until the early hours.

The persistent public as well as low-profile resistances have been discussed less. Europe used Greece as a guinea pig to test how late capitalism in crisis can be restructured with substantive reductions in wages, pensions, health, education and social services. What took the European and Greek elites by surprise was the determination of the guinea pig to transform itself from object to political subject.\n\nThis transformation was not unexpected. There comes a time when an economic and political system becomes obsolete and harmful. Yet two more elements are necessary before it departs the stage: a political subject prepared to take power; and a catalyst, a spark, that will kick off the disintegration of the regime. All three converged in Greece: the near universal popular rejection of the corrupt and disastrous political, economic and media elites; Syriza as the agent of change; and, finally, the troika and its austerity diktat as the symbol of all that has gone wrong.\n\nThe journey of Syriza from a small protest party to government-in-waiting is a political fairytale. The party polled 4% in 2009, became the main opposition in 2012, and received 27% of the vote in the European elections, with the rightwing governing party down to 23%. The transformation started in the occupations of the squares in 2011: the Greek resistance was understandably sidelined by the Arab spring and the Occupy movement but it was clear that the Greek spring had the greatest chance of success.\n\nSyriza, a highly democratic coalition of small euro-communist, ecologist and socialist parties (since unified into a single organisation), participated fully in the occupations without the usual leftist drive to dominate. When the multitude of the squares looked for parliamentary representation, it adopted Syriza as the party of change and raised it from relative obscurity to the future government.\n\nIs Syriza ready to govern? Between the breakthrough 2012 and the 2014 elections the party has developed a set of policies to kick off economic growth and political renewal. A governing Syriza will raise the minimum wage, reintroduce collective bargaining, and repeal the measures that have led to economic collapse and a humanitarian crisis. It will ask for a substantive haircut of the debt to make it viable \u2013 at the start of the crisis the debt was 120% of GDP, after four years of austerity it stands at 175% \u2013 and will peg repayment of the rest on economic growth.\n\nFurthermore, the party will defend national sovereignty against the neocolonial policies of the troika, which have suspended the minimum guarantees of the rule of law and the social state. National identity can be radical and patriotic, or exclusionary and xenophobic. To stop the rise of extreme rightwing ideologies, which are an acute problem in Greece, the left must redefine the meaning of patriotism and rescue it from racists.\n\nFinally, Syriza promises a defence of democracy. Neoliberal capitalism has replaced democratic governments with technocratic governance that has turned citizens away from politics. Only a different conception that combines direct and representative democracy can gather popular support. Participatory democracy, the legacy of the occupations, must be breathed into the mainstream political system. By promoting social justice and democracy, the left becomes the heir to the Enlightenment principles of freedom, equality and solidarity.\n\nCan the Greek left succeed? Its clean past and commitment to universal values creates a major moral advantage, but more is needed. The left must combine principle and pragmatism, radical politics and social mobilisation. It is a tall order for a small country and organisation. But it is the only hope for Greece and Europe against the rising Euroscepticism of the right. If it succeeds, the Greece of resistance will become the future of Europe.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/gallery/2014/5/27/1401192567842/Marie-Le-Pen-008.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b188bd19e2e16b6b70740085dddf022c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/3/1401789675794/Supporters-chanting-at-an-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=494bcedd50757ff3e15e57fe0802726b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/4/1401875477210/Protestors-of-Occupy-the--009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=56317f4fd3ab03f6caebac03f8528fca", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Greece%2CEuropean+elections%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+Union%2CSyriza", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/28/1401280850580/Marine-Le-Pen-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=22975b9eff6a7bec18662fd9dc8ef8b3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/3/1401789675794/Supporters-chanting-at-an-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4595d113d55c6e620544ae45e238f349", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/26/1401129854905/marine-le-pen-heartland-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42cea145060f2bb535757733f6e03fb3"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/3/1401789675794/Supporters-chanting-at-an-011.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=494bcedd50757ff3e15e57fe0802726b", "date": "03/06/2014"}, "rank_38": {"title": "Beware the Europhobe in sceptic\u2019s clothing | Alex Andreou", "text": "Last week, Mark Harper celebrated his re-promotion into government as minister of state at the Department of Work and Pensions, in a reshuffle that removed anyone not singing from the Eurosceptic hymn sheet. The former immigration minister, responsible for the controversial \u201cGo Home\u201d vans, had to resign a mere five months ago after it was revealed the cleaner he had employed for years was in the UK illegally. That same cleaner, Isabella Acevedo, was detained for deportation minutes before her daughter\u2019s wedding on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, a far-reaching government report into free movement across the EU was leaked to the BBC. The report had been due out in December, but its publication was delayed after Theresa May reportedly deemed its results \u201ctoo positive\u201d. It has been rewritten twice since and has been ready for publication since the spring. According to the leaked copy, the report estimates there are 2.3 million non-British EU citizens living in the UK and up to 2.2 million Brits living elsewhere in Europe and concludes that the effects have been \u201clargely positive\u201d.\n\nThese events set up a battleground for the next election, in which immigration \u2013 and, by extension, membership of the EU \u2013 is set to take centre stage.\n\nThe debate \u2013 a polarised \u201cyou\u2019re either with us or against us\u201d \u2013 is forcing the vast majority of people outside the centre ground. That centre ground is a true and positive Euroscepticism and it is essential to reclaim it. True Euroscepticism is being sceptical about the EU and the direction it has adopted; applying critical thinking, looking at the evidence and being open to either being convinced by it or not. The Europhobes who often pose as sceptics are not. There is no evidence that could convince them about the merits of the European project. The result is to force people such as me into a rabidly \u201cEurophile\u201d position because, when there is a danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water, one\u2019s instinct is to protect the baby with all vigour and ferocity.\n\nCentral to this Europhobia is a rewriting of the past; a presentation of the UK as a victim of circumstance that knew not what it signed up for and could not have predicted the direction. Piffle. The very first line of the Treaty of Rome speaks of a determination \u201cto lay the foundations of an ever-closer union\u201d. Winston Churchill, speaking in The Hague in 1948, explained that \u201cit is impossible to separate economics and defence from the general political structure. Mutual aid in the economic field and joint military defence must inevitably be accompanied step by step with a parallel policy of closer political unity.\u201d It is true that Churchill at the time did not see the UK\u2019s future inside this \u201cunity\u201d and it may be that after careful consideration we decide that it no longer lies there. But let us not do so on the basis of pretending that we were somehow deceived about the true nature of what we were joining.\n\nThe free movement of people is established in that treaty. There were good reasons that 10 years ago the Labour government decided to invite Polish labour into the country earlier than it needed to, a decision from which they have disgracefully stepped back now for reasons of political expediency. The economy was growing at pace and we desperately needed them. It is possible to have sympathy with plumbers and builders and electricians and decorators who struggle in a competitive environment now that times are leaner, while remembering how impossible and extortionate it had become to employ such tradespeople at the start of the millennium.\n\nThe answer is for us to collectively help those who \u201clost\u201d during a downturn, rather than to suddenly tell those we invited to make a life here 10 years ago that they\u2019re surplus to requirement. More importantly, the reasons we needed additional labour then have not gone away.\n\nThe equation is a simple one. There is a bulge on our population curve; the \u201cbaby boom\u201d generation is coming up to retirement. We must either accept a catastrophic drop in our living standards or boost the number of people of working age. That can be done in one of three ways: home-grown, migrant or a mixture of the two. It is, ironically, the same people on the whole who hand-wring about our pensions deficit and the loss of living standards, who also disapprove of the state subsidising people raising many children and rail against migrants. Something\u2019s got to give. Pick.\n\nIt is telling that the Europhobe alternative narrative always ends at a referendum endorsing exit. I have yet to hear a coherent narrative of precisely how the eggs are to be unscrambled. What happens to the 4.5 million people \u2013 either UK citizens elsewhere or non-UK EU citizens here \u2013 who may be displaced? What happens to the hundreds of thousands of individual unions among people of mixed UK/EU nationality? What happens to their children? What happens to the UK economy if exit plunges us into depression?\n\nThere is no doubt that the EU has lost its way. It has been captured by vested political, financial and corporate interests. It is up to us to reclaim it and reform it. But the worst thing we could possibly do is give in to this Europhobia, and end up binning civil rights or the five-day week, simply because the titles \u201cEuropean convention\u201d or \u201cworking time directive\u201d fill us with propaganda-induced dread. We could end up with a \u201csingle market\u201d which allows large corporations to sell books or coffee or advertising here, but hide their taxes in Ireland or Luxembourg, but which does not allow us to work or study where we want; a union for giant business, but not for you or me. It is up to us to reclaim Euroscepticism \u2013 the critical assessment of how we want Europe to work for us and make it work.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news%2CConservatives", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/24/1406206753969/Mark-Harper-demonstration-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d684ee1a2f83fe109fab8d76ac407727", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/21/1405940053104/The-home-secretary-Theres-014.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dea444be9de9356d846acf4d839a5791", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/31/1406804518796/Yarls-Wood-immigration-re-011.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=06e90c57bf48fdde1110dcc82f266796", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/21/1405940053104/The-home-secretary-Theres-014.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=988050934e3bca9727fe7d4b9ca5fc81", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2014/7/18/1405706284286/Tory-MP-immigrant-staff-015.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ed5c2765ea42d4ca142d09806da7981a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/21/1405940053104/The-home-secretary-Theres-014.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=988050934e3bca9727fe7d4b9ca5fc81", "date": "21/07/2014"}, "rank_242": {"title": "The silence about Europe right now makes me nervous | Natalie Nougayrede", "text": "I travelled to a small town in the west of England the other day, to meet an old friend I hadn\u2019t seen in years, curious to hear how she felt about Europe. She is English, my age, and we met when Britain was in the throes of the Thatcher era and France was about to elect its first postwar socialist president. Today my friend works as a teacher and continues to sympathise with Labour \u2013 she associates the Tories with the slashing of budgets for education.\n\nFor several reasons I also expected her to be a convinced pro-European. She teaches French and German, opening the minds of her young charges to a world beyond what she calls the \u201cincredibly insular English mindset\u201d. She spent part of her childhood in France and has kept strong links there. In her teens she went to Germany as an exchange student and discovered German memories of the war.\n\nWe are, she and I, very much part of a generation still marked by Europe\u2019s 20th-century history, a high point being the fall of the Berlin Wall. So, when I asked if it mattered to her that the UK remain in the EU, I was struck by her hesitant reply. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s best to be part of something bigger than ourselves. But Britain should be able to decide about some things on its own, for example, how we treat our prisoners.\u201d\n\nThis way to the Brexit: what would happen if Britain left the EU? Read more\n\nEuropean institutions are such a maze that it is hard to hold it against anyone who\u2019s confused about the difference between the EU and the European court of human rights. The mistake is a small illustration of how badly Britain still needs an informed and comprehensive debate about the pluses and minuses of staying in the EU. David Cameron has fuelled popular frustration with Europe by painting the European court as an encroachment on British sovereignty. But it\u2019s doubtful whether Labour has made an excellent job of convincing many of its supporters that Europe acts as an essential pillar of British influence and values.\n\nThree weeks away from a general election which could return the Conservatives and bring a 2017 referendum on EU membership, it is baffling to see what scant mention there is of Europe in the campaign. Yet Britain\u2019s fate as a power and the fate of Europe as a world actor have perhaps never been so intimately linked. In a global world, there can only be global or collective solutions.\n\nMany of the issues that people say they care about, from economic competition to national security, immigration and the environment, can only be seriously addressed if we act together. Europe, with all its flaws, is still the main vehicle that our nations can rely on to defend their interests in a world that has become more complex, competitive and unpredictable. How else can we negotiate seriously with a rising China, or deal with the refugee crises from Africa or the Middle East that risk deeply affecting our societies?\n\nDivisions, breakups, Brexits and Grexits will only make us weaker and our democracies more exposed. The illusion of going it alone, the little England syndrome, has many of Britain\u2019s partners extremely worried. Many continental officials I speak to don\u2019t dare say so publicly, but are scared stiff that without Britain, the EU project will simply collapse within this century. But at the same time, they will not accept the idea of EU treaties being renegotiated by British blackmail. This is the quandary we are in.\n\nIn the absence of any positive discourse about Europe, it is probably fear of the unknown that will keep us together\n\nBut it\u2019s also worth putting some things in perspective. British Euroscepticism isn\u2019t anything new. Nor is it simplistic. Recall the famous conversation in 1944, just before D-Day, between Churchill and De Gaulle. Every time Britain has to \u201cdecide between Europe and the open sea, it is always the open sea that we shall choose\u201d, said Churchill. What is perhaps less well-known about this episode is (as described by De Gaulle in his memoirs) that after Churchill spoke, Anthony Eden looked sceptical and Ernest Bevin, a Labour minister, came up to De Gaulle and said in a loud voice: \u201cTake note that the prime minister has spoken for himself, and in no way for the whole cabinet.\u201d Churchill, of course, went on to make his famous 1946 Zurich speech, calling for the \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d, although he didn\u2019t explicitly include Britain in that vision.\n\nThe European construct has always been divisive in Britain, and has cut across party lines. In 1975 it was a divided Labour government that held a referendum (67% voted yes to stay in). In the 1980s Margaret Thatcher, despite all her \u201cGive me my money back\u201d slogans, contributed to building the European project. The 1985 Single European Act transferred more power to Brussels than the 1957 Treaty of Rome.\n\nBritain\u2019s political class isn\u2019t alone in being tortured by its relationship with Europe. If you look at French politics, the same can be said: left- and rightwing traditional parties have been split for years, with strong sovereignist pressures on both sides. De Gaulle only really became interested in Europe after France lost Algeria. Hollande has enjoyed stabbing the European Commission almost as much as Cameron. Domestic politics trump European much of the time.\n\nYet the great difference today is that the big picture should count much more than parochial considerations. Europe faces huge existential challenges. Visionary language is what is needed to reassure citizens. In the absence of any positive discourse about Europe, it is probably fear of the unknown that will keep us together. As my English friend says, it\u2019s just best to be part of something bigger than ourselves.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/10/1418199749284/For-sale-signs-012.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6918a2c7bd00d2712b6c4adbf82da323", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/19/1413757580456/item-club-014.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=323aa933d6b232891c0a73c053f19aa9", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CDavid+Cameron%2CGeneral+election+2015%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news%2CBrexit%2CForeign+policy%2CEurope%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429212098697/De-Gaulle-and-Churchill-1-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=328d8713b86008d6a408316b62e0fcce", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Natalie-Nougayrede,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=39abd80b619a171082e0419bf1c6d516", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/20/1429547594257/e43a7ab2-d599-4224-a997-3a87ad3d5ca1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f2cac62bb2db2a1b7184816e815e7f26", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429212098697/De-Gaulle-and-Churchill-1-009.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=57199f2cfff1860192d1e1266c86a0c5"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/16/1429212098697/De-Gaulle-and-Churchill-1-009.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=328d8713b86008d6a408316b62e0fcce", "date": "17/04/2015"}, "rank_31": {"title": "The left must now campaign to leave the EU | Owen Jones", "text": "At first, only a few dipped their toes in the water; then others, hesitantly, followed their lead, all the time looking at each other for reassurance. As austerity-ravaged Greece was placed under what Yanis Varoufakis terms a \u201cpostmodern occupation\u201d, its sovereignty overturned and compelled to implement more of the policies that have achieved nothing but economic ruin, Britain\u2019s left is turning against the European Union, and fast.\n\n\u201cEverything good about the EU is in retreat; everything bad is on the rampage,\u201d writes George Monbiot, explaining his about-turn. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been pro-Europe,\u201d says Caitlin Moran, \u201cbut seeing how Germany is treating Greece, I am finding it increasingly distasteful.\u201d Nick Cohen believes the EU is being portrayed \u201cwith some truth, as a cruel, fanatical and stupid institution\u201d. \u201cHow can the left support what is being done?\u201d asks Suzanne Moore. \u201cThe European \u2018Union\u2019.

The more leftwing opponents of the EU come out, the more momentum will gather pace and gain critical mass. For those of us on the left who have always been critical of the EU, it has felt like a lonely crusade. But left support for withdrawal \u2013 \u201cLexit\u201d, if you like \u2013 is not new. If anything, this new wave of left Euroscepticism represents a reawakening. Much of the left campaigned against entering the European Economic Community when Margaret Thatcher and the like campaigned for membership.\n\nIt was German and French banks who benefited from the bailouts, not the Greek economy\n\nIt would threaten the ability of leftwing governments to implement policies, people like my parents thought, and would forbid the sort of industrial activism needed to protect domestic industries. But then Thatcherism happened, and an increasingly battered and demoralised left began to believe that the only hope of progressive legislation was via Brussels. The misery of the left was, in the 1980s, matched by the triumphalism of the free marketeers, who had transformed Britain beyond many of their wildest ambitions, and began to balk at the restraints put on their dreams by the European project.\n\nThe left\u2019s pessimism about the possibility of implementing social reform at home without the help of the EU fused with a progressive vision of internationalism and unity, one that had emerged from the rubble of fascism and genocidal war. It is perhaps this feelgood halo that has been extinguished by a country the EU has driven into an economic collapse unseen since America\u2019s great depression. It was German and French banks who recklessly lent to Greece that have benefited from bailouts, not the Greek economy. The destruction of Greece\u2019s national sovereignty was achieved by economic strangulation, and treatment dealt out to Alexis Tsipras likened to \u201cextensive mental waterboarding\u201d. Slovakia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr, may have deleted his tweet calling this modern-day Versailles \u201cthe results of their \u2018Greek Spring\u2019\u201d, but he is right: this was all about crushing a rebellion.\n\nUgly indeed. As the former European commission adviser Philippe Legrain puts it, \u201cGermany is proving to be a calamitous hegemon,\u201d overruling even France\u2019s objections.\n\nThe euro suits Germany, of course, as a weak euro is good for its exports and prevents poorer EU countries getting a competitive edge. But look at how the EU has operated. It has driven elected governments \u2013 however unsavoury, like Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s \u2013 from office. Ireland and Portugal were also blackmailed. The 2011 treaty effectively banned Keynesian economics in the eurozone.\n\nHostility to the EU is seen as the preserve of the hard right, and not the sort of thing progressives should entertain\n\nBut even outside the eurozone, our democracy is threatened. The Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership (TTIP), typically negotiated by the EU in secret with corporate interests, threatens a race to the-bottom in environmental and other standards. Even more ominously, it would give large corporations the ability to sue elected governments to try to stop them introducing policies that supposedly hit their profit margins, whatever their democratic mandate. It would clear the way to not only expand the privatisation of our NHS, but make it irreversible too. Royal Mail may have been privatised by the Tories, but it was the EU that began the process by enforcing the liberalisation of the natural monopoly of postal services. Want to nationalise the railways? That means you have to not only overcome European commission rail directive 91/440/EEC, but potentially the proposed Fourth Railway Package too.\n\nOther treaties and directives enforce free market policies based on privatisation and marketisation of our public services and utilities. David Cameron is now proposing a renegotiation that will strip away many of the remaining \u201cgood bits\u201d of the EU, particularly opting out of employment protection rules. Yet he depends on the left to campaign for and support his new package, which will be to stay in an increasingly pro-corporate EU shorn of pro-worker trappings. Can we honestly endorse that?\n\nGreece is the latest battleground in the financial elite\u2019s war on democracy | George Monbiot Read more\n\nLet\u2019s just be honest about our fears. We fear that we will inadvertently line up with the xenophobes and the immigrant-bashing nationalists, and a \u201cno\u201d result will be seen as their vindication, unleashing a carnival of Ukippery. Hostility to the EU is seen as the preserve of the hard right, and not the sort of thing progressives should entertain. And that is why \u2013 if indeed much of the left decides on Lexit \u2013 it must run its own separate campaign and try and win ownership of the issue.\n\nSuch a campaign would focus on building a new Britain, one of workers\u2019 rights, a genuine living wage, public ownership, industrial activism and tax justice. Such a populist campaign could help the left reconnect with working-class communities it lost touch with long ago. My fear otherwise is a repetition of the Scottish referendum: but this time, instead of the progressive SNP as the beneficiaries, with Ukip mopping up in working-class communities as big businesses issue chilling threats about the risks of voting the wrong way. Without a prominent Left Out campaign, Ukip could displace Labour right across northern England. That would be the real vindication of Ukippery.\n\nBritish progressives and the European Union: should we stay or should we go? | Letters Read more\n\nLexit may be seen as a betrayal of solidarity with the left in the EU: Syriza and Podemos in Spain are trying to change the institution, after all, not leave it. Syriza\u2019s experience illustrates just how forlorn that cause is. But in any case, the threat of Brexit would help them. Germany has little incentive to change tack: it benefits enormously from the current arrangements. If its behaviour is seen to be causing the break-up of the EU, it will strengthen the hand of those opposing the status quo.

But many on the left seem to be drawing precisely the wrong conclusions.\n\nThere is an argument gaining momentum on the left \u2013 given voice by Owen Jones in these pages last week \u2013 that the current EU crisis proves that the European project does not work for ordinary people. Many on the left, according to this line of argument, will have \u201cdipped their toes\u201d in the sea of Euroscepticism and found conditions more amenable than they expected. They invite the rest of us to join them: \u201cCome on in,\u201d is their pitch, \u201cthe water\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nThere is so much wrong with this approach that it is difficult to know where to start. They link this argument to the treatment of Greece, a country that, until a few months before the last British referendum on Europe in 1975, was under military rule. All political parties had been dissolved; the Greek constitution\u2019s protection of freedom of thought and press freedom had been suspended; military courts had been established. Trade unionists were imprisoned and tortured; the right of assembly was revoked; surveillance of citizens was an everyday fact of life; 8,000 people were held without trial.\n\nWhat has happened in Greece in the period preceding this latest referendum is of deep concern, but it hasn\u2019t led the Greek people to seek exit from the euro \u2013 let alone from the EU.\n\nThe most vociferous anti-EU voice in the Greek parliament is Golden Dawn, the far-right party created by Nikolaos Michaloliakos after prison brought him into contact with the incarcerated survivors of the Greek junta. Strange bedfellows indeed for our anti-EU left. The sceptics have no argument to explain how Britain\u2019s departure from the EU would help Greece, beyond bizarrely endorsing the Boris Johnson school of negotiation (motto: \u201cthreaten to leave and the bastards will concede anything\u201d).\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why Greece so values EU membership. We in this country have never experienced military rule or the totalitarian regimes imposed by eastern European communism. But millions of British lives were lost in two world wars that began on our continent. The EU has made the biggest contribution to peace and democracy in Europe. The Greeks remember that and so should we.\n\nThere has always been a Eurosceptic left. Greece hasn\u2019t changed its mind, it has merely provided it with an impetus and a fresh line of argument. Jones has always been a Eurosceptic and, in support of his \u201clonely crusade\u201d, suggests the left was mistakenly beguiled into supporting the EU having been \u201cbattered and demoralised\u201d by Thatcherism. But it\u2019s simpler than that.\n\nMy experience in the trade union movement during its glam rock era is that we got it wrong. It was a time when we opposed the minimum wage and supported the closed shop; when we eschewed any basic minimum standards for working people underpinned in law because it might interfere with our ability to recruit members. Thus we opposed not just social Europe but the EU itself long after the referendum had settled the question of British membership.\n\nWhat we saw under Thatcher was how quickly trade union influence and protection for working people could be removed by a determined Tory leader. The danger is that we might make the same mistakes all over again.\n\nThe old arguments against Europe still suffer from the old weaknesses. The EU is no more a grand corporatist conspiracy than it is the business-hating socialist project of the Tory right\u2019s fevered imagination. Rather it is a political forum where the left must engage just as we do at national level. Whatever the travails of the eurozone, the key aspect of Britain\u2019s engagement with the EU is the single market. Crucially, this is a market with rules, not least legislation to protect consumers, workers and the environment.\n\nJust as David Cameron may seek to relax the rules protecting workers rights, so we must work to enhance them \u2013 for instance by tackling the exploitation of free movement of workers by insisting that they receive the wage rate appropriate to the sector (eg construction) rather than just the minimum wage.\n\nIn the months to come, the Labour party will connect with communities across the country. It will do this not to indulge in a fundamentally dishonest vision of leaving the EU for a promised land that doesn\u2019t exist or simply to defend the status quo. We believe that, in an age of increasing interdependence, isolating Britain will damage growth, jobs and prosperity. The main victims of that adventurism would be ordinary UK workers.\n\nReform of the EU is not an event, it\u2019s a process that requires us to build alliances and exert influence. We must expose the Eurosceptic fallacy that the EU is something that\u2019s \u201cdone to us\u201d; where Britain is somehow a perpetual victim of the other 27 member states.\n\nThe European Union is simply a place we have built where we can manage our interdependence. It was developed because the peoples of Europe recognised one value above all else \u2013 a value that we need today perhaps more than ever, not only to restore Greece to its rightful place in our European family but also to preserve Britain\u2019s.

Several Guardian columnists \u2013 Owen Jones, George Monbiot and Suzanne Moore \u2013 have argued that it is. But this is mistaken. Their conclusions are based on a distorted view of what is happening in Greece.\n\nGreece doesn\u2019t want to leave Europe, and neither should Britain | Alan Johnson Read more\n\nRightwing British Eurosceptics have for long salivated at the prospect that Greece might be expelled from the euro. Although they are shedding crocodile tears at the plight of the Greek people, their motive is to milk the crisis to advance their domestic political agenda: Britain\u2019s exit from the EU.\n\nThe new phenomenon is the surge in leftwing Euroscepticism. This is based on the perception that Greece has been bullied into accepting austerity by other eurozone countries, led by Germany. Progressives have swallowed undiluted the propaganda pushed out by Greece\u2019s radical left Syriza government: that the EU is an organisation that rides roughshod over the people\u2019s democratic wishes because it is hellbent on imposing a bankrupt neoliberal economic ideology.\n\nIf this impression takes root, it could have severe consequences. It could undermine the left\u2019s support for Britain\u2019s EU membership. Given that the Conservative party is also split on the issue, there would be a serious risk that the country might vote no in the coming referendum. David Cameron has been careless in calling such a vote and blithely assuming he can rely on Labour backing yes solidly. But being able to pin the blame after the fact on the prime minister will be little comfort for pro-European progressives if the result has been Britain quitting the EU.\n\nThere is much that is correct in the left\u2019s narrative on Greece. For example, the euro was badly designed, with a bias towards deflation. What\u2019s more, Greece should not have joined the currency, as its economy wasn\u2019t fit enough to endure the straitjacket of a single monetary policy.\n\nWhat is progressive about people not paying taxes and retiring under the age of 50?\n\nOnce the crisis hit, Athens should have been allowed to default on its debt (much of which was then held by foreign banks) rather than borrowing extra money from fellow eurozone countries. It should also not have been required to implement so much debilitating and self-defeating austerity.\n\nBut there is also much that is wrong in the left\u2019s narrative. It doesn\u2019t mention that Greece had many deep-seated problems that pre-dated the creditor-imposed austerity: rampant tax evasion, an epidemic of early retirement, a bloated public sector and a private sector carved up by special interests. These problems need to be corrected before Greece can thrive. It doesn\u2019t help to label these necessary reforms as neoliberal. What is progressive about people not paying taxes and retiring under the age of 50?\n\nThe left narrative also ignores the fact that the creditors\u2019 tough love policy has worked in four other countries: Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. Things are far from perfect, but all these economies are growing again. Greece was growing too, until the last conservative government stopped implementing the bailout programme a year ago. Six months\u2019 rule by Alexis Tsipras then turned a mild downturn into a full-blown recession.\n\nSyriza, of course, blames the creditors for the recession, arguing that they ran a deliberate policy of choking the economy in order to bring the government to heel. But, while the eurozone has not played the role of an angel, the main culprit is the prime minister himself.\n\nTsipras made wild pre-election promises that he couldn\u2019t deliver; he chose a confrontational firebrand, Yanis Varoufakis, as his finance minister; and he failed to develop either a credible plan for cutting a deal with his creditors or a proper plan B in case he was unable to do so. Britain\u2019s progressives, however much they sympathise with the Greek people, should not align themselves with such incompetence.\n\nBut didn\u2019t the eurozone, and especially Germany, trample on the democratically expressed wishes of the people? Well, not really. There\u2019s no theory of democracy under which one country\u2019s politicians must do what another country\u2019s people want. German leaders are elected to represent their people, not the Greeks. We would get pretty angry if Cameron started doing what, say, the Poles demand rather than what we want.\n\nDavid Cameron has been careless in calling such a vote and blithely assuming he can rely on Labour backing yes solidly\n\nOf course, countries should try to help one another \u2013 especially close allies who share the same currency. But it\u2019s not true that the eurozone hasn\u2019t shown any solidarity. Although much of the money was used to bail out foreign banks, a big chunk went to rescue Greek banks and another dollop went to plug Athens\u2019 budget deficit. What\u2019s more, the creditors have already given Greece some debt relief by agreeing to low interest rates and allowing the country a long time to repay its borrowings.\n\nEurozone countries haven\u2019t been nearly as helpful to Greece as they could have. But what on earth has this to do with our own membership of the EU? We are not in the euro and, if we pulled out of the EU, that wouldn\u2019t help the Greeks one iota.\n\nWhat we would be doing is sacrificing our own interests. We would be settling for second-class access to Europe\u2019s single market, which accounts for half our trade. We would also be diminishing our ability to address a range of challenges \u2013 such as global warming, organised crime, terrorism and Russian militarism \u2013 that cross borders.

For the Britons of the 1970s \u2013 recovering from fuel shortages and the three-day week \u2013 the story of a European future was more convincing than imperial nostalgia, the warm embrace of Washington or the charm of the Commonwealth. But what about this time round? The assumption of pro-Europeans has been that the sceptics will be a backward-facing rabble with little to say about the future. Are they right?\n\nSo far the Eurosceptics have told us much more about what they are against than what they are for. They attack the euro, austerity, the common agricultural policy, red tape, free movement. But once the referendum starts, the sceptics will need to reveal their own plans for Britain\u2019s future. One of the biggest questions is whether the four main variants of Euroscepticism can coalesce into a single campaign \u2013 and whether the media will force them to develop a single alternative.\n\nOf those four visions, \u201cSingapore on steroids\u201d is the most exotic account of our island future. Douglas Carswell \u2013 Ukip\u2019s first member of parliament and the politician most closely associated with this vision \u2013 tells me that he is not sure if he ever used the phrase, and he is no fan of Singapore\u2019s hereditary and authoritarian system of government. However, his vision of Britain as an outward-looking trading nation with a large financial sector, high levels of migration, a small state, low taxes and an internet-enabled democracy does resemble Asia\u2019s most successful city-state in many regards.\n\nWatch Nigel Lawson: he is a safer bet than Ukip for Eurosceptics | Martin Kettle Read more\n\nLike Singapore, Britain would \u2013according to this vision \u2013 have an active foreign policy, but it would try to extract economic opportunities from its relationships with others, rather than trying to shape the world. The state would shrink dramatically: government spending in Singapore is 14.5 % of GDP, compared with the United Kingdom\u2019s 45%. It is less equal than any country in the developed world (even the United States) and nearly four in 10 of its population are immigrants.\n\nCarswell is refreshingly blunt about the need for migrant labour: \u201cOur grandparents\u2019 generation had to get to grips with the idea of importing strawberries from Spain and mangetout from Kenya. Today we live in a world where labour mobility is inevitable, and unless you want to become like North Korea you need to accept it. You can no more ban labour mobility than food imports.\u201d\n\nNot so, claims the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, whose vision is of a little England that restricts migration and withdraws from the common market to regain control of sovereignty. He appeals to the socially conservative instincts of people left behind by globalisation. At the last election, Ukip pledged to limit highly skilled work visas to 50,000 per annum \u2013 including those from the EU \u2013 while applying a moratorium on unskilled and low-skilled labour over the course of the parliament. Given the numbers of people who are leaving Britain every year, that would mean going from a growing population to one that shrank by hundreds of thousands of people a year. And a falling population would mean a downsized economy (Farage has said that \u201csome things are more important than money\u201d) and a downsized foreign policy. When I spoke to Farage he described Tony Blair\u2019s messianic foreign policy as a post-imperial hang-up. Farage claims that no party in Britain has been more non-interventionist than Ukip: \u201cGoing into Afghanistan to make the streets of Britain safer is not something I ever saw the logic of \u2026 We couldn\u2019t see the point of Libya. We don\u2019t know what is going in Syria \u2026 We don\u2019t want to get involved in any foreign wars.\u201d Did Farage support any of the wars that Britain has been involved in since the second world war? \u201cThe Falklands, I\u2019d have gone myself. And the first Gulf war.\u201d\n\nWithout Ukip, Douglas Carswell could be a brilliant independent MP | Martin Bell Read more\n\nA third vision is of a leftish \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of Britain\u201d. Before he became leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn called the EU an organisation \u201cthat continues to pursue its central goal of being a place where big business has free rein to operate\u201d. Since his leadership began he has tempered his Europhobia, but there is a persistent strand of leftish Euroscepticism that has been given added passion by the impact of austerity in the eurozone.\n\nKelvin Hopkins, one of a handful of Labour MPs who support withdrawal from Europe, claimed in the Morning Star that the EU was \u201ca branch of global neoliberalism, of laissez-faire capitalism, constructed to raise up the power of the market and progressively dismantle the socialist and social democratic structures which were established and were so successful in the immediate post-war decades\u201d.\n\nOthers on the left call for a populist campaign for a \u201cLexit\u201d \u2013 a leftwing exit from the EU. At its heart would be a campaign to revive the ability of governments to implement the sort of industrial activism needed to protect domestic industries; opposition to the TTIP \u2013 the Transatlantic Trade Investment Partnership; and a programme of nationalisation of rail and postal services (though it is not clear to me that this would be illegal under existing EU rules).\n\nThere is a fourth vision of \u201cout\u201d that tries to look as much like \u201cin\u201d as possible \u2013 a model that can best be described as \u201cbigger Switzerland\u201d: no slashing of the state, no return of industrial planning, no closed borders. Its proponents claim that they would preserve the best elements of the EU while shedding the worst, and negotiate a magical set of treaties that enshrine this relationship. The choice is partly technical \u2013 what kind of trading arrangement do we want with the EU? What kind of border control?\n\nThere are two variants of this vision. Either Britain will try to keep access to the single market and negotiate a deal like Norway or Switzerland \u2013 a kind of EU minus. Both basically accept free movement (they have higher percentages of EU nationals living in them than does the UK), sign up to almost all EU law, and pay almost as much into the EU budget as the UK. They can theoretically choose not to apply EU regulations \u2013 though because they would lose access to the EU market in those areas, they have never actually done it. But they have big disadvantages: no voice in EU decision-making and no access to trade deals the EU strikes with the rest of the world.\n\nThe other model is Turkey, which has a customs union with the EU. Ankara neither benefits from nor offers free movement to the EU, and doesn\u2019t need to apply all EU law. It doesn\u2019t get access to the single market or EU global trade (though it is forced to open its market to everyone the EU strikes a deal with).\n\n\u201cThe European project is inherently conservative,\u201d says Carswell. Like other Eurosceptics, he casts Brussels as the ultimate blob, an alien force that subverts our democracy. But what the Eurosceptics do not acknowledge is that most of their ideas aren\u2019t made impossible by the EU \u2013 but rather by the British electorate.\n\nToday\u2019s EU is as accommodating to free-market Slovakia with its flat tax and minimal state and Estonia with its internet-enabled democracy as it is to the flexible mixed economies of Scandinavia and the less flexible France, with its 57% of public spending and huge public sector. It would have little room for Farage\u2019s utopia of no immigration or the left\u2019s nostalgia for a closed managed economy.\n\nHowever, it is not the EU that keeps Carswell from reducing the British state by two-thirds, or the radical left from nationalising the postal services \u2013 it is the British people, who have so far shown no great enthusiasm for these ideas. Hijacking the referendum and British scepticism about the union to promote these visions has been a clever move \u2013 but in reality the critics\u2019 proposals have less to do with the EU than they make out.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CDouglas+Carswell%2CUK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a4d5679860abf42effa72fdcbb3d67b04c3bf2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=25b875a0391f5cd4fe777d774a5dc311", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a4d5679860abf42effa72fdcbb3d67b04c3bf2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c276c86ed64352d9d679e1494c2ec630", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a4d5679860abf42effa72fdcbb3d67b04c3bf2/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=25b875a0391f5cd4fe777d774a5dc311", "date": "05/10/2015"}, "rank_219": {"title": "Still plenty of time for change in our Eurosceptic daily press", "text": "A week is a long time in politics: consider two years and two months, the maximum arguing time left before that European referendum.

Even if, due to arcane coalition machinations, it is unable to form a government, the Law and Justice party (PiS) looks certain to emerge as the largest single parliamentary group. Pre-election polls gave it a lead of up to 14 points over its nearest rival, the ruling Civic Platform. By any measure, PiS won the argument, and the campaign, and it will be odd if it is denied power.\n\nA Poland under PiS could make all of Europe\u2019s myriad problems look just that much more difficult to solve\n\nFor a watching, apprehensive Europe, the vagaries of Poland\u2019s system of representative democracy are not the salient issue. The issue is what PiS and its eminence grise, the former prime minister, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, appear to stand for: a divisive Euroscepticism, pugilistic nationalism, anti-migrant populism, old-school statist economics, Russophobia and alleged fiscal irresponsibility. A Poland under PiS could make Europe\u2019s myriad problems look just that much more difficult to solve.\n\nYet it would be both harsh and foolish to pin the blame for such a worrying prospective regression on Polish shoulders alone. In the wake of the global financial slump, after the near meltdown of the eurozone and the Greek financial crisis, after years of punishing austerity (which Poles largely escaped) and in the midst of the biggest inward migration surge in living memory, Polish voters are merely the latest electorate to face the watershed choice that is confronting Europe as a whole.\n\nIt is a choice between steady adherence to the progressively democratic, consensual, socially responsible and inclusive values ostensibly embodied in the EU and a descent into polarising tribalism in international affairs, societal introspection and xenophobia at home, and intolerant, hard-right, hard-left political warfare. Looked at another way, it is a choice between Europe\u2019s 20th-century past and what could and should be its 21st-century future. Put less grandly, the question for Europe is this: is the Orb\u00e1n model right or wrong?\n\nRefugee crisis: how does Europe solve a problem like Viktor Orb\u00e1n? Read more\n\nFor the past five years, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, has delighted in offering an oppressively deformed vision of Europe\u2019s development. As Ian Traynor, the Guardian\u2019s European editor, noted recently: \u201cOrb\u00e1n does not have a good word to say about modern Europe, whose response to the refugee issue [he describes as] \u2018madness\u2019 \u2026 [He] has used his power to write a new constitution, cow the media, stuff the constitutional court with supporters, purge the foreign ministry and the diplomatic corps, restructure parliament and gerrymander electoral districts. He mocks European notions of liberal democracy and voices admiration for Vladimir Putin in Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey.\u201d\n\nOrb\u00e1n, who claims to be defending Christian Europe against the Muslim horde, was at it again last week at a conference of European conservatives in Madrid. Migrants were akin to an occupying army, he said. \u201cWhat we [are] facing is not a refugee crisis. This is a migratory movement composed of economic migrants, refugees and also foreign fighters. This is an uncontrolled and unregulated process.\u201d\n\nOrb\u00e1n\u2019s antics are deplored in Brussels and other western European capitals. But in too many parts of central and eastern Europe, and in rightwing western circles, his odious outlook, particularly towards refugees, is seen as justified, even exemplary. Nor have Poland\u2019s hustings escaped the influence of the Orb\u00e1n model. While PiS\u2019s platform differs in many key respects from Orb\u00e1n\u2019s, there are disturbing similarities, too.\n\nKaczynski recently claimed that refugees were bringing \u201ccholera to the Greek islands, dysentery to Vienna, various types of parasites\u201d, in comments that critics said recalled Nazi propaganda. The fact that his words were far from universally condemned was a reminder of how socially conservative many Polish voters remain. The election is \u201cabout whether liberal democracy will survive in Poland\u201d, a leading political scientist, Radoslaw Markowski, has warned. \u201cIf PiS end up governing alone... Poland will become another Hungary.\u201d\n\nAcross many parts of western Europe, the hard-right contamination of intolerance and bile is spreading inexorably. Following the stabbing of a mayoral candidate last weekend, German security experts and politicians warned of an upsurge in racist and xenophobic attacks as support for rightwing extremism grows, spurred on principally but not exclusively by migration. Already, the number of such attacks this year is double the total for all of 2014.\n\nThousands gather in Dresden for anniversary of Pegida movement Read more\n\nLast week also saw the biggest rally for months of the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam movement Pegida. One speaker, now under investigation, told the 15,000-strong crowd in Dresden that it was \u201cunfortunate the concentration camps are no longer in operation\u201d. Germany\u2019s interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, blamed Pegida for inciting hatred. \u201cWe can\u2019t yet speak of rightwing terrorism, but the threat is there,\u201d he said. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel, a dominating figure on the European stage, is not immune to the political fallout. Her government\u2019s popularity has plummeted to a two-and-a-half year low.\n\nIn France, Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National is on the march. Polls show support rising in the run-up to local elections in December, with the FN tipped to win outright in two regions. In Austria, the far-right Freedom party attracted a record 31% backing in the recent Vienna mayoral poll. Nationally, it has 20% support. Switzerland has also swung decisively right, with a surge in backing for the Swiss People\u2019s party (SVP). Similar phenomena are in evidence in Finland and Denmark. Only in the likes of Spain, Portugal and Greece, where memories of recent experience of fascism remain strong, is Europe\u2019s disintegrating centrist political consensus tending to break left, rather than right.\n\nEurope\u2019s changing politics are driven by many factors, not simply by insecurity and the threat to identity caused by rising immigration. Widening post-crash economic injustice and social division, the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent, out-of-touch and corrupt national and EU governance have all contributed to the rightwards lurch apparent in Poland, Germany and elsewhere. Fear is the common denominator now linking the peoples of Europe. And at present, few, if any, at least at national level, are successfully articulating a persuasive alternative message of hope.\n\nIt can be done. In Canada, the youthful Liberal leader, Justin Trudeau, has just swept to power with a message of relentless positivity. Among his pledges, an end to the bombing of Syria and Iraq, more compassionate and inclusive social policy, greater gender equality, electoral reform \u2013 and, yes, an airlift of 25,000 Middle Eastern refugees. If Europe is to discredit the Orb\u00e1n model and avoid a return to the destructive, distrustful, divisive nationalism of the past, it needs champions in the Trudeau mould to stand up and speak for its hard-won values. Democracy is worth it. And make no mistake, European democracy is under threat.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Poland%2CThe+far+right%2CEurope%2CRace%2CWorld+news%2CPolitics%2CHungary%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6e897799ae7176cb84d84b9c253bcbe34222136/0_0_3325_1995/master/3325.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0827cd820eaecabd1cfefff7f3c990a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3bc45051456c022c2f13d190276b0f9996e033/0_15_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=beb64188c9e89cb6daab0424a0325091", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c46197ad73b7337ac61e7e466f490ded0b56f2b4/0_81_3737_2245/master/3737.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e33b954c5be7b9fdd1e5848e5d3fcf7", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3bc45051456c022c2f13d190276b0f9996e033/0_15_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c58f5fbbce6e7ba0d96fbbe687687355", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3bc45051456c022c2f13d190276b0f9996e033/0_15_2417_1450/master/2417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=beb64188c9e89cb6daab0424a0325091", "date": "24/10/2015"}, "rank_214": {"title": "The Guardian view on the Polish and Portuguese election results: less Eurosceptic than they seem | Editorial", "text": "It is tempting to use Europe\u2019s crowded electoral calendar as a way of reading the runes about the continent\u2019s future and, in particular, about the future of the European Union. The outcome of elections this month in countries at the opposite ends of the union, Poland and Portugal, does tell us something about the balance between pro-EU and anti-EU forces across the continent, which is that, marginally at least, the latter are becoming somewhat stronger. Inevitably, but incorrectly, this change is understood by some in Britain as relevant to the UK\u2019s coming referendum. But Euroscepticism is a loose label for a lot of things, not a movement.\n\nIn Poland, a party more Eurosceptical than its predecessor will take power, either on its own if a final count gives it an absolute majority, or in partnership with a smaller party. In Portugal, a diminished centre-right coalition is trying to form a government but may well be displaced by a group of parties led by the Socialists but including two junior partners that have in the past advocated withdrawal from the union and from Nato, although they dropped these demands in order to work together to seek power.\n\nWorrying times for democracy in Portugal | Letters Read more\n\nBut, as we get more used to Euroscepticism \u2013 it has become to some degree the default condition of all members of the EU \u2013 these broad reckonings seem less important than they used to, for three main reasons. The first is that national politics often uses a pro- and anti-European vocabulary readily (and sometimes recklessly) to discuss issues that are essentially domestic. The second is that the lines between wanting to be out of Europe and wanting a different Europe are very blurred. The third is that Eurosceptics tend to grow less sceptical as they approach, and particularly when they take, power.\n\nIn the Polish election campaign, the EU in the formal sense was far from being the main issue, in spite of British coverage implying that it was, but one related to the position of Poland in the larger European and western family of economies was probably critical. Poland\u2019s younger generation, who voted for the Law and Justice party in unprecedented numbers, see themselves as victims. While their elders coast along with stable pensions and communist-era housing, the young struggle to get decent jobs, or have to go abroad for work, and mortgages are hard to get and too expensive. Poland has the largest proportion in the EU of working people on precarious contracts, around 30%.\n\nAnd yet this is in the country with the best growth record of any in Europe in the post-crash period. The obvious conclusion is that the happiness and the prospects of young people are being sacrificed so that the companies, both local and international, investing in the country can make bigger profits. The promises of the Law and Justice party to do something about this must have had a great deal to do with its success.\n\nYoung people may have been as important in Portugal\u2019s election as they were in Poland\u2019s, although in this case it is lack of jobs rather than precarious jobs that is the main question. Portugal has record unemployment and youth unemployment rates, with tens of thousands of its citizens emigrating to find work. That the lack of decent jobs or of any jobs at all for young people is important in elections is hardly a jaw-dropping surprise.\n\nThe problem, of which most European politicians are well aware, even if they avoid enunciating it, is that both national governments and the European institutions are not dealing effectively with the challenges our societies face. Renationalisation \u2013 dissolving or diluting the union \u2013 would leave even the stronger states less able to look after themselves in a tough world, but increased centralisation in the EU is a difficult option because member states are not ready to hand over more powers to Brussels \u2013 or, as some of them see it, to Germany \u2013 or to incur the wrath of their electorates by doing all the unpalatable things that Brussels decrees. The agonised effort to achieve some agreement and coherence over Middle Eastern migrants is proof enough of that.\n\nYet, in spite of leaders such as Slovenia\u2019s Miro Cerar saying that unless Europe finds a solution to the migrant crisis \u201cit is the end of the EU as such\u201d, it is clear that an imperfect EU is better than none at all. It may be that electorates and politicians, \u201cEurosceptics\u201d included, are at the point where they understand better than they did that the EU is a constraining and sometimes infuriating framework, but one without which the world would be even scarier than it is now.", "images": ["https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/09/Owen-Jones,-L.png", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4adc19f45a3db4eb1fd936a422aee6364da4b96/0_1294_2946_1767/master/2946.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=54716335b32bd96313fd72884369de8f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/383b307525049d6d1388bb90084fe6290819947c/0_174_4500_2699/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60c09fba6e8d060412123a886539e0b7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11fb8ade0fc0d8b466b4e7922d43c3306a5963f7/0_155_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e1617d9404ef46089d2aa88d89592e0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4adc19f45a3db4eb1fd936a422aee6364da4b96/0_1294_2946_1767/master/2946.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f761bd53c59bca8ea5929ad53215eb42", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0777e3c5292760a3f577f3e8d8eb305070ff3605/0_0_4096_2460/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=17e84dca45d3dfd4e31c79ad9cf44ced", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Poland%2CPortugal%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CYoung+people%2CSociety%2CYouth+unemployment%2CUnemployment"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4adc19f45a3db4eb1fd936a422aee6364da4b96/0_1294_2946_1767/master/2946.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=54716335b32bd96313fd72884369de8f", "date": "26/10/2015"}, "rank_4": {"title": "Immigration and Euroscepticism: the rising storm", "text": "Geoffrey Evans and Jonathan Mellon look at how the issue of immigration will impact upon the EU referendum vote\n\nThe public has become acutely aware of changes in immigration rates and attributes these changes to the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union.

Below we show long-term immigration rates for non-UK citizens obtained from estimates of international migration provided by the international passenger survey.\n\nWe also present evidence on trends in concern about immigration expressed via responses to questions about what people think are the most important issues facing the country.\n\nImmigration increased markedly at the end of the 20th century and has remained exceptionally high since. We can see a spike in concern about immigration in the 1970s when the National Front obtained some degree of political presence, even though there was no great growth in immigration itself around that time.\n\nFarage must go? While he dominates the immigration debate, it\u2019s unlikely | Simon Jenkins Read more\n\nFar more noticeable, however, is the rise in concern that started just before the turn of the century. From this point on, concern about immigration was closely associated with immigration levels. The dip following the onset of the economic crisis in 2007-08 is unsurprising given the impact of the crisis on levels of concern about the economy, but the rising rates returned after only a short interlude.\n\n\n\nThe public appears to have become responsive to changes in immigration rates. However, overall immigration rates do not themselves have implications for attitudes towards the EU. For immigration to impact on EU attitudes people need to perceive an association between EU membership and levels of immigration. When we break down immigration into region of origin by separating Commonwealth, EU, and other sources of immigration we can see that this is indeed what seems to have happened.\n\nEU immigration played no part in the rising immigration of the late 1990s and early 2000s \u2013 this was produced by an increase in asylum-seekers from other parts of the world. EU immigration takes off with the 2004 accession of former communist-bloc countries of eastern Europe into the EU and the government\u2019s decision not to restrict immigration from these countries during the first five years of EU membership. After 2004, however, EU immigration formed a major component of immigration into Britain. By 2013 it was the largest component.\n\nJeremy Corbyn says he opposes making EU migrants wait to receive benefits Read more\n\nDid the public connect this change in the composition of immigration with their view of the EU? Recent rises in concern about immigration appear to be linked closely with trends in EU immigration and not with immigration from other sources: concern increases along with increasing EU immigration rates whereas levels of immigration from other sources are falling or flat.\n\nIn itself, however, this aggregate relationship isn\u2019t compelling evidence that individuals are linking their attitudes to immigration with those to the EU. Fortunately, we are able to look at this relationship more closely using the CMS monthly surveys, which contain measures of both concern about immigration and attitudes towards the EU for each respondent.\n\nWe can therefore examine whether immigration concern has become linked with opposition to the EU. Below we show the difference in EU approval scores (\u201cHow much do you approve of Britain\u2019s membership of the EU?\u201d) between respondents who believe immigration is one of the most important issues facing the country, and those who don\u2019t.\n\nDifference in EU approval among people who state \u201cimmigration\u201d as one of the most important issues facing the country and those who don\u2019t\n\nThe difference in EU approval between people who believe immigration is an important problem facing the country and those who do not widens sharply during the years following the 2004 accession before flattening off during the economic crisis, only to steeply rise shortly afterwards as EU immigration rates also shoot upwards.\n\nClearly, the link between concern about immigration and a negative view of the EU has strengthened considerably in the years following the opening of access to immigrants from the 2004 accession countries.\n\nThe relevance of this relationship for the forthcoming EU referendum is inescapable. Below we show the connection between believing that \u201ctoo many immigrants have been let into Britain\u201d and EU referendum vote intention. We also illustrate the significance of this relationship by comparing it with the 1975 EU referendum.\n\nBrexit will set UK back \u00a311bn in EU trade costs, research finds Read more\n\nIn 2015 only 10% of people who do not believe too many immigrants have been let into the country would vote to leave the EU. But no less than 50% of those who believe too many immigrants have been let in would do so. In 1975 there was no significant relationship between immigration and EU referendum voting. If anything, the relationship was the reverse.\n\nThe relationship between anti-immigration attitudes and opposition to the EU has strengthened greatly in recent years, in direct response to the dramatic growth in immigration from, specifically, the 2004 EU accession countries.\n\nRecent immigration from Bulgaria and Romania is likewise accompanied by a markedly increased level of concern about immigration. This spiral of alarm and negativity will clearly have an influence on the outcome of the EU referendum vote.\n\nGeoffrey Evans is a professor at the University of Oxford and a fellow of Nuffield College.

Hague\u2019s intervention follows calls from Sir John Major last week for Britain to remain in the EU and it appears to be part of a coordinated attempt to get heavyweight, Eurosceptic-leaning Tories to speak out in favour of Britain remaining in.\n\nHague said that, for all its faults, the EU played a valuable role in helping the new eastern European and Balkan countries embrace democracy and that it would be wrong to weaken it.\n\n\u201cIf the countries of the western Balkans are shut out of European institutions, their festering divisions will create one crisis after another, on our own continent, of political turmoil, economic failure and uncontrolled migration. We still need the EU to provide the safe harbour for the docking of fragile democracies, and it would be strange to champion that idea but abandon it ourselves,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that without the UK, the EU would be weaker. It would lose the fifth largest economy of the world, the continent\u2019s greatest centre of finance, and one of its only two respected military powers. We will have to ask, disliking so many aspects of it as we do, whether we really want to weaken it.\u201d\n\nHague said that if Britain voted to leave the EU, Scotland would have the excuse for a second independence referendum, \u201cand the result of it could well be too close to call\u201d.\n\nBut Hague also used the article to express his reservations about the EU. The commission, \u201cthe best-performing of the EU institutions\u201d, spent too much money, he said. The European court of justice suffered from a \u201cdetachment from reality\u201d and the European parliament did not provide democratic accountability because its elections were not taken seriously and its MEPs were effectively anonymous.\n\nStephen Gethins, the SNP\u2019s spokesman on Europe, said Hague\u2019s column read like \u201ca desperate begging letter on behalf of a Tory government that is only now realising just how dangerously close it has brought the UK to leaving the EU\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhile it is welcome progress to see senior Tories finally ceding that it would be completely unacceptable for Scotland to be dragged out of the European Union against its will, we still have no answers as to how they will ensure this does not happen.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mark Field, one of several Conservative party vice-chairmen, urged David Cameron not to allow ministers a free vote on the EU referendum. Speaking to the Telegraph, Field said that ministers who wanted to speak out in favour of leaving the EU should resign and make their case openly \u2013 and stop \u201cundermining\u201d Cameron with unattributable briefings.\n\n\u201cI have the greatest respect for all those in my party who believe we should leave the EU, but clearly such a position is incompatible with holding a ministerial office in advance of the referendum,\u201d Field said.\n\n\u201cWhat I don\u2019t accept is individual ministers believing they should publicly have a free rein or that they can, in an off-the-record way, spend the next few months undermining the prime minister\u2019s package of renegotiation. That is quite wrong.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street source dismissed a story in the Sun claiming that ministers had been assured privately that they would be allowed a free vote.\n\nThe source said collective responsibility applied while the EU renegotiation was still going on and that the prime minister would not take a decision on whether to allow ministers to campaign to leave the EU, or whether to insist on them all backing the government\u2019s position, until after the renegotiation was over.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6128fbe20eba13734d028c5d506c46465267a55b/72_676_2909_1746/master/2909.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30668b14c29cde5bbc43c9309c2e9a69", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWilliam+Hague%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CEurope", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6128fbe20eba13734d028c5d506c46465267a55b/72_676_2909_1746/master/2909.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f42860d36ba4dbc7e5490a1a80851541"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6128fbe20eba13734d028c5d506c46465267a55b/72_676_2909_1746/master/2909.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f42860d36ba4dbc7e5490a1a80851541", "date": "23/12/2015"}, "rank_1": {"title": "British Euroscepticism: a brief history", "text": "WHAT PATH FOR EUROPE,\n\nPOST 1945?\n\n\n\nAfter the second world war, Winston Churchill spelled out his vision \u201cto recreate the European family, or as much of it as we can, and to provide it with a structure under which it can dwell in peace, in safety and in freedom.

At the time, Labour had the more prominent Eurosceptics, notably Hugh Gaitskell, who said a year later that joining a federal Europe would be \u201cthe end of Britain as an independent European state, the end of a thousand years of history\u201d. Macmillan\u2019s application was vetoed for a decade by French president Charles de Gaulle, who feared that the UK would torpedo the grand projet.

He allowed Eurosceptic cabinet ministers, led by Michael Foot and Tony Benn, to campaign against (his ministers were so split, he had little option). Most of the Tory press backed staying in, and the result was 67% in favour. The Labour cabinet came together, but its Eurosceptics did so with trepidation. The pro-Europe home secretary, Roy Jenkins, said: \u201cIt puts the uncertainty behind us. It commits Britain to Europe; it commits us to playing an active, constructive and enthusiastic role in it.\u201d Benn, the anti-EEC industry secretary, was humbled but fearful. \u201cWhen the British people speak, everyone, including members of parliament, should tremble before their decision and that\u2019s certainly the spirit with which I accept the result of the referendum.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Thatcher delivers her blistering speech in Bruges in 1988.

But she came to despair of the European project. Her Bruges speech of 1988 became a template for a new generation of Tory sceptics. It was not given to put the country on course for an exit, but to limit Europe\u2019s ambitions. \u201cTo try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the centre of a European conglomerate would be highly damaging and would jeopardise the objectives we seek to achieve,\u201d Thatcher said. Tory Eurosceptics were inspired. Increasingly, they believed the original vision of a trading area had been supplanted by Franco-German ambitions for political and economic union. As the centre of gravity shifted in both main parties, Labour under Neil Kinnock embraced a social Europe, albeit with resistance from unions and the left. Thatcher\u2019s increasingly strident scepticism put her at odds with key members of her cabinet, including Michael Heseltine, and hastened her downfall.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Major\u2019s anger at Eurosceptic members of the cabinet culminated in him calling them \u2018bastards\u2019 in an unguarded moment.

In 1993, he described Eurosceptic members of his cabinet (the likes of John Redwood and Michael Portillo) as \u201cbastards\u201d, as exclusively revealed by the Observer. With a tiny working majority, his government was crippled by division. The Tory war raged just as Tony Blair arrived as Labour leader in 1994, promising to lead a British government committed to the EU and which would even consider joining the euro if conditions were right.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gordon Brown and Ed Balls wanted strict conditions to be met before Britain joined the euro.

Towards the end of Labour\u2019s first term, the issue was causing real tension, as Brown, the chancellor, and his economic adviser, Ed Balls, insisted on strict tests being met. The Tories, under their anti-EU leader, William Hague, made little progress, and less under the more hardline Iain Duncan Smith. But as more European treaties, from Amsterdam to Lisbon, brought ever deeper integration, Tory Eurosceptics began to talk openly of EU exit. When David Cameron put himself forward as a prospective Tory leader in 2005, it was on a promise to lead the party out of the centre-right federalist grouping, the European People\u2019s party (EPP), as a signal of intent.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The rise of Ukip, led by Nigel Farage, has caused headaches for David Cameron.

Having honoured his EPP pledge, his Eurosceptics wanted far more. He went to Brussels to cut the EU budget and veto integrationist plans, but it was not enough. They wanted a referendum on whether to stay or leave. In 2013, he gave them one and said he would try to renegotiate a better settlement for the British people before holding a vote before the end of 2017. Now, as that renegotiation concludes and his Eurosceptics say nothing but \u201cout\u201d will do, it is decision time.

Scenting blood and aided by the rise of the UK Independence party, the right exerted relentless pressure on the prime minister who was eventually forced to concede in 2013 to an in/out EU referendum.\n\nCameron had only wanted to hold more limited EU referendums. In opposition he pledged to hold one on the Lisbon treaty and alarmed the right when he abandoned this promise once the treaty became legally binding after its full ratification.

But he found himself slowly boxed in and eventually announced in January 2013, in his speech at the London headquarters of Bloomberg, that he would hold a referendum.\n\nThe Guardian view on the Brussels EU summit: six things that will still be true tomorrow | Editorial Read more\n\nThe seminal moment in the prime minister\u2019s bumpy journey to Thursday\u2019s EU summit came in the same Justus Lipsius building at the end of June 2012 when he ruled out the idea of a an in/out referendum. \u201cThe problem with an in/out referendum is that it only gives people those two choices,\u201d the prime minister said at the end of the annual summer summit. \u201cYou can stay either in with all the status quo or you can get out.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister spoke with such confidence because he regarded the summit as a triumph for what he called his \u201cpractical eurosceptic\u201d approach after he blocked plans to extend a eurozone banking union across the EU. But his remarks provoked a backlash on the right and, two days later, the prime minister moved ground on an in/out referendum in a tortuously worded article for the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cFor me the two words \u2018Europe\u2019 and \u2018referendum\u2019 can go together, particularly if we really are proposing a change in how our country is governed, but let us get the people a real choice first.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s performance at the June 2012 summit highlighted his key miscalculation. A gifted leader, he always assumed that he could manage the right; he even signed up John Hayes as his unofficial ambassador to the Tory right. Hayes is a leading light in the Cornerstone group of MPs who played a decisive role in persuading Cameron to agree to withdraw from the EPP during the Tory leadership contest in 2005.\n\nBut the response over the first weekend of July 2012 showed that the prime minister has never been able to control the right and has consistently under estimated their ability to shape his approach to Europe. Once the referendum genie was out of the bottle it could never be put back in as the prime minister embarked on a process that he has never been able to fully control.\n\nIn his Bloomberg speech in 2013, the prime minister barely mentioned the issue of migration which now lies at the heart of his negotiations. In fact the only mention of the subject was when he spoke of the hundreds of thousands of British people who \u201cnow take for granted their right to work, live or retire in any other EU country\u201d.\n\nDavid Davis, Cameron\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership in 2005 and now campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, says the prime minister has learnt a painful lesson slowly. \u201cOne of the things every prime minister discovers along the way is quite how recalcitrant the European machine is. It is designed to go in one direction, it has no reverse gear, it has very little in the way of steering. It just heads towards a federalist outcome.

The justice secretary knows that joining the out campaign could terminate the political careers of his two great friends and boost the leadership chances of Theresa May and Johnson.\n\nIn an impassioned plea on Thursday night, the prime minister, who has been kept fully informed about Gove\u2019s thinking, showed the pressure when he warned his counterparts that they were risking \u201csuicide\u201d if they expected him to run a referendum campaign to keep Britain in the EU without a \u201ccredible\u201d deal to sell to the British people.

But on Sunday night, as Johnson at last declared himself a supporter of Brexit, this long-evaded contest became inevitable.\n\nWhy would the two men have been reluctant to take one another on? As vaultingly ambitious as he is, the London mayor knows that his strategic rivals are George Osborne, Theresa May and any other contender to succeed Cameron. He has generally observed the principle that energy expended in fighting \u201cDave\u201d is energy that could have been deployed chasing the leadership.\n\nAs irritated as the prime minister has often been by his fellow Old Etonian \u2013 his texts to Johnson are often direct to the point of profanity \u2013 he knows that the mayor is a valuable asset to his party, a charismatic campaigner and a flash of colour in the grey trade of politics. Most of the time, he has hugged Johnson close \u2013 notably in September 2012, when he invited the mayor\u2019s whole family to Chequers, seeking his support for the renegotiation and referendum strategy unveiled in the Bloomberg speech of January 2013.\n\nBoris Johnson backs Brexit after 'agonisingly difficult' decision \u2013 live Read more\n\nFor a while, all went to plan: Boris toured Davos in a woolly hat praising the prime minister\u2019s speech to every senior European politician he met: \u201cBien jou\u00e9, David Cameron, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d Yet it was clear even before the blueprint published by Donald Tusk, president of the European council, that Johnson was not persuaded by Cameron\u2019s diplomacy. Earlier this month, he declared there was \u201cmuch, much more that needs to be done\u201d. Having watched with dismay as the Tusk plan went through the mill of an EU summit, he found that his respect for Cameron\u2019s stamina was simply not enough to draw him into the company of the \u201cremainers\u201d.\n\nClearly, Michael Gove\u2019s decision to support Brexit \u2013 disclosed while Cameron was still negotiating \u2013 transformed the context in which Johnson would make his decision. In practice, the justice secretary was the canary down the mine of Westminster opinion, setting out in beautiful prose the reasons for his dramatic breach with Cameron. Like Geoffrey Howe in 1990, whose resignation speech paved the way for Johnson\u2019s mentor Michael Heseltine, Gove had provided a lead for others to follow.\n\nEven so, as late as Saturday morning Johnson was completely undecided and still turning to confidants for advice. What if he gambled all on Brexit but lost? Would he wake up on 24 June to find his ambitions dashed on the rocks of a historic decision and a fatal misreading of public opinion? That was, and is, the nature of the gamble.\n\nIn the end, he could not resist his instincts, or an apprehension that he would feel treacherous to himself if he took the easy path and signed up to the remainers\u2019 camp. Obsessed with Homeric epic and Churchillian drama as he is, Johnson would have found it difficult to play safe while others took swashbuckling risks.\n\nOn Sunday night Cameron\u2019s allies were doing their best to appear relaxed about the mayor\u2019s decision. But they are no such thing. In January, private research showed that only two figures could change the political weather to the benefit of the leavers: May and Johnson. The home secretary was brought on board this month. But the mayor has resisted Cameron\u2019s blandishments, giving the out camp a spectacular boost.\n\nWill that boost prove durable, or just a flare that lights up the battlefield briefly? That is another way of asking what kind of campaign this is going to be. Thus far, it has been a riot of bathos, veering from the petty to the profound, and back again. The battle of the two Etonians \u2013 Brexit v Brussels! \u2013 will be great entertainment, politics for the X Factor generation. But will it nurture a great decision?\n\nAlready, as the various campaigns storm out of the traps, the Brussels negotiations are fading in memory. As one board member of Britain Stronger in Europe puts it: \u201cThe deal had to be done but it won\u2019t shift many votes. This is a straight battle between in and out.\u201d True enough, probably \u2013 and a shame.\n\nTo see what a phony \u201crenegotiation\u201d prior to a referendum looks like, go back to 1974-75. Token changes were made to the EEC budget and the rules governing New Zealand exports, but as Sir Michael Butler, a senior British diplomat at the time, would later reminisce: \u201cWhat we were doing was making an appearance of renegotiation rather than a reality.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the 2016 deal amount to more than the chicken-feed of caricature is its navigational content. The gains that Cameron made are all about Britain\u2019s future trajectory in the EU \u2013 if the voters decide that it has one, that is. The exemption of this country from the journey to \u201cever closer union\u201d is of fundamental importance, for instance. It will prevent European court of justice judges invoking this objective in decisions affecting the UK. So too the emergency brake sets an important precedent for EU migrants and benefits, establishing the principle that, in certain circumstances, benefits should be paid according to the levels prevailing in the country from which the EU citizen has come. This deal also promotes the separation of the single market and single currency \u2013 a British objective for many years that would have been unthinkable in the Maastricht era.\n\nWhether you believe that all this amounts to a \u201cspecial status\u201d for the UK is a matter of rhetorical taste. What it certainly represents is a significant shift in the compass guiding Britain\u2019s membership in the EU.\n\nOn Monday, Cameron will present his deal to the Commons, where his own MPs \u2013 including, no doubt, Boris \u2013 will pose much the most probing questions. The EU is the canvas upon which the modern Conservative party projects its most horrible nightmares and sees its most lurid dystopias made real. The prime minister, ever the pragmatist, sees a flawed alliance of states that aggregates its power to \u201cfix stuff\u201d. His more ideologically minded colleagues interpret the EU as an institutional expression of all they oppose: a fortress of dirigisme, a solvent of nationhood, a threat to British democracy and independence.\n\nFor 10 years, Cameron has managed to keep the beast of full-blooded Tory Euroscepticism more or less under control. But on Monday the beast will be unleashed.\n\nAs Cameron and his team toured the Justus Lipsius council building last Thursday and Friday, they noticed that each delegation matched their expectations. The Danes had beautifully designed furniture. The Italians had the best (and badly needed) espresso. In the same spirit, the question facing all of us between now and 23 June is nothing less than: what sort of country do we want Britain to be? That is the question that lurks, pulsing, beneath the slogans, the personalities, the big fight between Dave and Boris. It is a decision that will resonate for decades, and by which a generation will rightly be judged. Will we realise this in time?", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a8a94d56980b171b262ef343a5578bb13083f18/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5c735dc6fd197abe5c9bcbbbee96f97c", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CBoris+Johnson%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CDavid+Cameron", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a8a94d56980b171b262ef343a5578bb13083f18/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c0a8b419dcf1775792dfd54a20afc9d4", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a8a94d56980b171b262ef343a5578bb13083f18/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5c735dc6fd197abe5c9bcbbbee96f97c", "date": "21/02/2016"}, "rank_17": {"title": "Euroscepticism in Scotland soars to record high", "text": "Survey findings contradict SNP claims that referendum could take Scotland out of EU against its will\n\nEuroscepticism in Scotland is at a record high, according to research that challenges claims that the country is significantly more pro-European than the rest of the UK.\n\nThe authoritative study for NatCen Social Research uncovers widespread Euroscepticism throughout the UK, but with a majority unlikely to vote to leave the EU unless they are persuaded of the economic case for Brexit.\n\nIn an apparent contradiction of SNP claims that the forthcoming referendum could take Scotland out of the EU against its will, the study also found that 60% of Scots can be classed as Eurosceptic, with only one-fifth happy to \u201cleave things as they are\u201d.\n\nAccording to the research, based on the annual Scottish Social Attitudes survey carried out between July 2015 and January this year, 43% of respondents want the EU\u2019s powers reduced and 17% want to leave, more than at any time since 1999.

Should we be worried about the spiritual leader of the out campaign? Having seen the Johnson phenomenon in gestation, I think so.\n\nNo Boris, you can't have your Brexit cake and eat it too Read more\n\nBy way of explanation, a little history. In the mid-1990s, soon after arriving in Brussels as a Europe correspondent, I was assigned to find the truth about a long-running Euro-myth: the claim that Brussels was to force Britain to call its chocolate \u201cvegelate\u201d. At that time learning about Euro-myths \u2013 smaller condoms, square strawberries, fishermen forced to wear hairnets \u2013 took up more time than explaining treaty changes.\n\nThe myths were usually funny, often absurd, sometimes traceable to a grain of truth, nearly always grossly distorted, or totally untrue. Very often they had first appeared in the Daily Telegraph.\n\nUsually, their creator was Boris Johnson, who had for some years worked as the Telegraph\u2019s EU correspondent, famous in the press room as a shuffling, shabbily dressed fellow, with a sharp intellect, huge ambition, and a talent for constructing myths. That mastery launched his career back then, and will be crucial to his relaunch, commenced this week, as a serious politician and Conservative party leader in waiting. He is older now and feted, but the modus operandi seems much the same.\n\nThen, as now, he hit the ground running, for quickly he was churning out stories of plots being hatched and traps being laid for Britain. There were threats to our pink sausages and to cheese biscuits. So often the myths were about food; Johnson knew that a quick way to win readers and get a laugh was through their stomachs.\n\nAs his stories resonated, editors in London pressed their Brussels men (and a few women) to find their own myths. The Daily Star said double-decker buses were to be abolished. But Johnson\u2019s myths were always best. The headquarters of the commission was to be blown up due to an asbestos scare.\n\nThen came the biggest whopper of all: \u201cDelors plan to rule Europe\u201d ran a front-page headline in the Sunday Telegraph in May 1992, just ahead of the Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Nobody could follow that except to say it was untrue, and based on thin ideas floated at a casual briefing, but denials came too late for Danish voters, who said \u201cno\u201d. Many attribute that to Johnson\u2019s story.\n\nRebutting a Johnson myth was a thankless task and the commission itself was powerless to fight back \u201cbecause what we said wasn\u2019t funny\u201d, as one spokesman put it at the time. Refuting the condoms story, one spokesman resorted to profanity, telling the Sun it was \u201cbullshit\u201d. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d never have got my point of view in.\u201d\n\nNow the beast of full-blooded Euroscepticism is unleashed | Matthew d\u2019Ancona Read more\n\nJohnson\u2019s half-truths created new reality, as I discovered while trying to untangle council directive 73,241, which set out rules on quantities of vegetable fat versus cocoa fat. Because Britain used more vegetable fat than other countries, a lowly official suggested Britain call its chocolate \u201cvegelate\u201d: hence the myth. There was no serious plan and no compulsion. It was what Johnson himself might describe as \u201cpiffle\u201d.\n\nThen, as now, he was a charmer. We knew he had been sacked by the Times for fabricating a quote, but he endeared himself by admitting that sometimes he \u201coveregged\u201d things. Then he\u2019d deploy that knowing smile, as if to say, well, we all hype scoops from time to time.\n\nThe contradictions were glaring, for privately he seemed a man at ease with Europe; and knowledgable about its history. Denis MacShane, Labour\u2019s former Europe minister, recalls crossing the central lobby of the Commons one day accompanied by the historian and Guardian columnist Timothy Garton Ash. Boris Johnson appeared: \u201cWhy! If it isn\u2019t Metternich and Talleyrand,\u201d he said. His father, Stanley, was a senior European commission official and an MEP. Boris himself attended the European school in Brussels before Eton. He even tried to become an MEP after leaving his job as a correspondent.\n\nBut that was then. Now it seems clear to Johnson that his safest route for moving towards No 10 involves a return to mythology. His exposition of the case for Brexit, published in last Monday\u2019s Telegraph, showed all the traits. He even recycled his myths on \u201cEuro-condoms and the great war against the British prawn cocktail flavour crisp\u201d.\n\nAnd there was new mythology: the suggestion that Brexit could lead to a second referendum, allowing Britain to negotiate a better settlement from Brussels. The prime minister himself moved to rebut it, but as European commission officials discovered long ago, a Johnson myth is not easily dismantled.\n\nFrom adjacent desks in Brussels, correspondents witnessed Johnson shaping the narrative that morphed into our present-day populist Euroscepticism.

No, the many who want Britain out of Europe deserve to be listened to | John Harris", "text": "The EU referendum is announced, and less than a year after its humiliation at the last general election, the dismal science of opinion polling is back. A YouGov survey in Wednesday\u2019s Times, for instance, led off with news that, once the all-important don\u2019t-knows had been excluded, 51% of its respondents wanted out, while 49% favoured staying in. Some 26% said David Cameron had got Britain \u201ca good deal\u201d, but 35% thought the opposite.\n\nEU referendum: Cameron claims leaving EU could make cutting immigration harder - Politics live Read more\n\nThere was also the revelation that when \u201cthinking about the referendum\u201d, 17% were said to \u201ctrust\u201d Michael Gove, while 10% feel the same about the employment minister Priti Patel. That is surely more than have actually heard of her, but whatever: this stuff is often what passes for a nuanced understanding of the public mood.\n\nOn the remain side, a flimsy grasp of the real world is reflected in another problem: the idea that anyone who wants to leave the EU must in some way be irrational, old-fashioned, or simply unhinged. At Westminster, such views have long been focused on the politicians and activists now at the forefront of the leave campaign \u2013 witness Cameron\u2019s infamous description of Ukip as a collection of \u201cfruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\u201d, or one of his allies\u2019 characterisation of Tory Eurosceptics as \u201cmad, swivel-eyed loons\u201d.\n\nOn the left, one hears the same view of senior outers \u2013 as fantasists, eccentrics and xenophobes. And behind all this, there also seems to lurk an unspoken view of the millions of Britons for whom senior leave campaigners claim to speak: as gullible, if people are feeling charitable; as nasty and bigoted, when things turn cruel. Class, moreover, is a subtext that is never too far away.\n\nIf you doubt this, think back to May 2014, and a plague of tweets with the hashtag #WhyImVotingUkip, which continued sporadically for the next 18 months. \u201cI wasn\u2019t educated very well and because of this I\u2019m going to blame smelly immigrants as the reason I can\u2019t get a job,\u201d went one; \u201cBecause I\u2019m uneducated, uncultured, white and old,\u201d said another. Strange how supposedly \u201cprogressive\u201d types can have such a dim view of their fellow human beings.\n\nI will be voting to stay in on 23 June, essentially because of three convictions: first, that if we are ever to somehow tame international capital, a supranational institution spanning a reasonable swath of the planet will be a necessity; second, that the UK\u2019s continued membership represents some vague counterbalance to those who would like to turn the place into a neoliberal hellhole; and third, that there is a lot to be said for the idea that the EU has kept Europe from once again bursting into flames.\n\nMost of my beliefs on Europe are as awash with emotional factors and shaky optimism as anyone else\u2019s\n\nGiven the institution\u2019s recent history, the first two of those convictions are increasingly more a matter of faith than anything really evidence-based, which leaves me with the somewhat finely balanced case recently summed up by the website Open Democracy: \u201cThe European Union is an undemocratic corporate stitch-up. But leaving would be worse.\u201d In other words, most of my beliefs on Europe are as awash with emotional factors and shaky optimism as anyone else\u2019s.\n\nMore to the point, I have been to enough places where Euroscepticism runs deep and wide to have a strong respect for its basic position. Whenever the remain side gets too full of itself, I remember my trip to the agricultural centre of Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, where a third of the local population now come from eastern European countries. Though the next generation might be starting to mix and integrate via the wonders of state education, the result for now is a profound sense of tension: a 2014 study reckoned that 68% of voters in the town\u2019s parliamentary constituency would choose Brexit.\n\nI also think of Peterborough, where the same study put the share of out voters at 60% \u2013 and though things are not quite as troubled, much the same problems are ever present, and highly unlikely to be altered by Cameron\u2019s new deal. Or maybe Great Yarmouth (a whopping 69% Eurosceptic), where scores of people claimed that a big meat processing plant now recruited most of its workers on the continent, leaving locals shut out, and convinced they were at the blunt end of a serious injustice.\n\nThose stories are not just about immigration and free movement, nor how hollow those assurances about the EU underwriting jobs and prosperity can often sound. They are also centred on huge and rapid social changes that people feel have been imposed on them by a power beyond anyone\u2019s reach. And on that specific point, to all intents and purposes, they are right.\n\nBack in 1974, Tony Benn visited Brussels and wrote about facing \u201cpeople with more power than I had and no accountability to anybody\u201d. Forty years on people all over the country, often living in the most precarious circumstances, feel exactly the same imbalance as a matter of lived experience.\n\nCameron refuses to apologise to Ukip Read more\n\nTheir feelings, moreover, blur into the way the referendum speaks to something that a lot of politicians and most of the media will still not touch. Though it will have profound consequences for the UK as a whole, the vote is essentially an English political event: an attempt to resolve English tensions within an essentially English party, which will see the leave side speaking to a group of people who increasingly self-identify as English, and who feel that an antipathy to authority is now part of their national identity.\n\nThe EU fits into this because it is another power centre that highlights an inescapable fact: that while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been given a greater say in their affairs, England still largely goes without.\n\nA manifesto for informed debate on the Brexit question | Letters Read more\n\nThis is why the senior leave campaigner David Davis was recently quoting Chesterton (\u201cwe are the people of England, that never have spoken yet\u201d), and the Daily Mail ran its pantomime-Eurosceptic \u201cWho will speak for England?\u201d front page. Whatever their motivations, the resentments they wanted to play on are real \u2013 and rational. And the fact they regularly explode to the benefit of the political right surely represents one of the left\u2019s biggest modern failures.\n\nFor the next four months, all of these tensions will be brought to the boil. Those who want Britain to stay in the European Union need to acknowledge them, think deeply, and not so lightly dismiss what their side is up against. Because if they don\u2019t, the great calamities of which they warn will be all the more likely to come to pass.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51968dcad27a8106bb728846f2a09a616f2bc87e/0_305_5318_3191/master/5318.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8783ef292a277d0b6ebf2db1df0eae03", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51968dcad27a8106bb728846f2a09a616f2bc87e/0_305_5318_3191/master/5318.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98a31741a2930d7e6672e4224ccd1f46", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/06/26/John_Harris_Next_Gen.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71554a58d52e35724d1464ab0e413199"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51968dcad27a8106bb728846f2a09a616f2bc87e/0_305_5318_3191/master/5318.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8783ef292a277d0b6ebf2db1df0eae03", "date": "26/02/2016"}, "rank_156": {"title": "Queen voiced 'scathing views' on EU more than once, says Sun editor", "text": "The Sun has stepped up its battle with Buckingham Palace over its report about the Queen\u2019s alleged Euroscepticism by claiming it knows more than it has published, while David Cameron has ruled out an official inquiry.\n\nThe paper\u2019s editor, Tony Gallagher, robustly stood by the paper\u2019s story on Wednesday that the Queen had vented her anger during a lunch at Windsor Castle in 2011, and suggested she had voiced similar views on at least one other occasion.\n\nSun editor says he's 'completely confident' Queen backs Brexit: Politics live Read more\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday, Gallagher said: \u201cWe knew much more than we published, and that remains the case. There is not just one occasion when these views were aired. There was a second occasion when she expressed similarly scathing views about the EU at Buckingham Palace.\u201d\n\nAfter the initial story appeared on Wednesday under the headline \u201cQueen backs Brexit\u201d, the palace took the unusual step of complaining to the press regulator. The palace said the complaint related to clause one of the editor\u2019s code, which covers inaccurate headlines not supported by the text of the article.\n\nThere had been calls for Downing Street to launch an official investigation into any leak of reported comments made by the Queen. But the prime minister said the matter was being dealt with by the press watchdog and there was no need for a further inquiry.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Sussex, Cameron said: \u201cThe palace has made a very clear statement, the former deputy prime minister has made a very clear statement saying that this didn\u2019t happen and I think we should leave it at that.\n\n\u201cThere is obviously a proper investigation now being held by the press complaints commission and I think we should let them do their work.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere has been widespread speculation that the justice minister, Michael Gove, who is campaigning for a vote to leave the EU, was one of the sources for the story, as he was at the Windsor Castle lunch. A spokesman for Gove said he did not comment on private conversations.\n\nCameron appeared to accept that he was not involved. \u201cThese are very serious matters but as far as I can see Michael Gove has made clear that he has no idea where this story came from either,\u201d he told BBC Oxford.\n\nMP Dan Jarvis, the Labour backbencher widely touted as a potential challenger to Jeremy Corbyn, commented on the row on Thursday morning. Asked about Gove, he said: \u201cMost people would take a very dim view if such a senior cabinet minister was seen to be behaving in that way\u201d.\n\nSpeaking earlier, when asked whether the Sun was guilty of overwriting the headline to the story, Gallagher said: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cTwo sources came to us with information about the Queen and her views on the EU and we would have been derelict in our duty if we didn\u2019t put them in the paper.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the story is inconvenient for a good number of people is not my fault. We serve our readers, not the elite who might be upset at what we\u2019ve written. We are completely confident that the Queen\u2019s views were expressed exactly as we\u2019ve outlined in both the headline and the story.\u201d\n\nPalace complains to watchdog over Sun\u2019s \u2018Queen backs Brexit\u2019 claims Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Sun\u2019s front pages from Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nGallagher would not be drawn on the details or the timing of the second occasion when the Queen is said to have expressed Eurosceptic views.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you the precise details of the second occasion because all it will do is set off a rather absurd molehunt in the fashion of today\u2019s newspapers, which are seeking to name Michael Gove. It would be very unfair to the sources who have spoken to us quite bravely,\u201d he said.\n\nGallagher refused to name the sources of the story and claimed the speculation about the source was being driven by those backing the campaign for Britain to remain in the EU.\n\nHe said: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t expect me for a single moment to reveal anything about the source of the story in the Sun. Those of a cynical mind would think there\u2019s an attempt to take somebody like Michael Gove out of the leave campaign. And the fact that [former deputy prime minister] Nick Clegg and [Labour MP] Wes Streeting have been on their hind legs complaining about it vociferously would rather point in that direction.\u201d\n\nQueen's Brexit rant never happened, says Nick Clegg Read more\n\nGallagher was asked whether the Queen had known there would be an EU referendum when she made the remarks.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think that\u2019s semantics. In 2011 it is pretty clear that the eurozone was in the midst of a huge crisis and it would be entirely unsurprising if Her Majesty had views on the matter and felt Britain\u2019s destiny was best served outside of the European Union.\u201d\n\nGallagher denied that the Sun had an agenda against the royal family, following a series of articles suggesting Prince William was \u201cworkshy\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are judging stories on their merits. It isn\u2019t just the Sun newspaper that has highlighted the fact that we see Prince William as workshy. Most of the national press have pointed out the fact that he doesn\u2019t seem to have a very taxing full-time job in Norfolk and does very few royal duties. It is a matter of record. The story has been covered in multiple media sources.\u201d\n\nLeave campaigner Chris Grayling, who as leader of the House of Commons presides over the privy council, said the Queen\u2019s views should be kept private. He told Today that the press regulator was the right organisation to investigate whether a member of the privy council had leaked details about what the Queen said.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhatever she says is always to be kept in private. And she has always been very scrupulous about not being politically partisan, and that\u2019s what makes her such a great monarch.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere clearly is going to be an investigation, because the palace has asked Ipso, the body that reviews stories of this kind, to find out what\u2019s happened and it\u2019s the right and proper body to do that.\u201d\n\n\n\nChallenged on whether Ipso had sufficient powers to investigate, Grayling said: \u201cThey have got a lot more powers than the Press Complaints Commission used to [have].

Constituency secretary Sue Connelly is wonderfully plain-spoken. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of Europe as quickly as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want our country back.\u201d Her loathing of David Cameron for backsliding on the EU (and much else besides) is palpable. \u201cI can\u2019t stand the man.\u201d You sense Connelly is not a woman to cross lightly.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Osman Dervish and Sue Connelly of the Romford Conservative Association. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nShe is at HQ to greet me with Terry Justice, the chairman of the Conservative association in neighbouring Dagenham. Justice (\u201cWhat we don\u2019t have a lot of,\u201d he says when I ask him his name) is drinking tea from a union jack mug; I get mine in a mug with the flag of St George on it. The constituency HQ was reopened by Lady Thatcher in 2005 after an arson attack had caused extensive damage the year before. A large plaque commemorates her visit, and pictures of her adorn every wall. Thatcherism is alive and well in Romford, and leaving the EU is the central article of faith.\n\nI ask Osman Dervish, the chairman of the Conservative Association in the town, whether he was surprised Romford had topped the poll for Euroscepticism. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a traditional market town, with people who are proud of where they live and where they come from, proud of their tradition and heritage. A lot of them grew up in the East End and moved out here having made good. They are Mrs Thatcher\u2019s children. Many of them support that idea of aspiration and moving up the property scale.\u201d\n\nDervish\u2019s family are originally from northern Cyprus, but he says that has no bearing on his attitude to the EU. \u201cI love Europe. Without Europe as a strong continent of varied states, each with their own specialism, we wouldn\u2019t have civilisation as we know it. This isn\u2019t about where you\u2019re from. It\u2019s about the principle. The concept of the European Union as a free trade area has changed into something else, something anti-democratic.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018If she wants to get out, I\u2019m with the Queen, so let\u2019s go!\u2019 Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nLawrence Webb, the leader of the six-strong Ukip group on Havering council, calls the area \u201cEurosceptic Central\u201d. In January, he tabled a motion on the council declaring that the UK would be better off outside the EU; it was passed by 30 to 15, making Havering the first elected body in the UK to vote to leave. Romford\u2019s MP, Andrew Rosindell, who achieved instant fame in the 2001 general election when he campaigned alongside a staffordshire bull terrier dressed in a union jack waistcoat (the dog, not the prospective MP, wore the coat), is probably the most fervent anti-EU Tory in the country. But Ukip still managed to poll more than 11,000 votes in Romford, coming a healthy second to the Conservatives. As YouGov\u2019s poll suggests, this is a town where Euroscepticism knows no bounds.\n\nWebb walks me around Romford\u2019s market square, where a few hardy traders and shoppers are braving the drizzle. Tony Geary, who has a stall selling clothing and is chairman of the Romford Market Traders Forum, says he hasn\u2019t quite decided how he will vote in the referendum, but is leaning towards leave. \u201cI\u2019m probably 70/30 to get out. We\u2019ve allowed our borders to be open far too much. There are too many people in the country.\u201d To clinch the point, he holds up a copy of that day\u2019s Sun, the front page of which announces that the Queen backs Brexit. \u201cIf she wants to get out, I\u2019m with the Queen, so let\u2019s go!\u201d\n\nThe politicos in Romford might obsess about the question of who governs Britain, but immigration is the key issue for the man and woman in the street. \u201cWe should definitely come out,\u201d says Katrina Woods, who is shopping in the market square with her friend Jane Verner. \u201cWe\u2019re overcrowded as it is. We\u2019ve got no houses for our own children. Or look at the way they\u2019re treating people in hospital. You go down the hospital and you\u2019re waiting hours. You\u2019ve got old people left on trolleys. They haven\u2019t got beds for them.\u201d\n\nVerner says it\u2019s probably already too late. You can\u2019t send back the people who have already come in, they tend to be relatively young and have large families, the population is going to rise anyway. But Webb tells them getting out now will at least deprive 500 million other EU citizens of the right to come to the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you didn\u2019t get in,\u201d Verner tells him. \u201cEverybody I know voted Ukip. It sounds like we\u2019re being horrible. Those poor people \u2013 if it was us, we would want to get to somewhere better. But you just can\u2019t keep taking them.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not prejudiced,\u201d adds Woods. \u201cI\u2019ve got foreign in the family.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask for their names, they look anxious, fearing they have spoken too openly. But Webb reassures them. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he says, \u201cnobody round here reads the Guardian.\u201d Which, I discover later, is not quite true: Quadrant News in South Street has sold out \u2013 both the Guardians they get daily have gone. \u201cThey certainly soon go,\u201d says the man behind the counter. It seems that even Eurosceptic Central has a few closet liberals.\n\n\u2018What are we going to do if we leave the EU?\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aberystwyth: \u2018an enriched, cosmopolitan community\u2019. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nAs well as identifying the most Eurosceptic place in Britain, the YouGov poll also named the most Europhiliac \u2013 the county of Ceredigion in mid Wales. The largest town in Ceredigion is Aberystwyth, which has a population of around 13,000, plus another 11,000 students at the university, and after my day in Romford that is where I head, on a train that trundles amiably through the lovely countryside of mid Wales. The slate-grey skies of east London have turned blue; lambs gambol in the fields; the river Dyfi winds its way gently towards Aberdovey; the inviting beach at Borth hints at the possibilities of summer. It isn\u2019t just in attitudes to the EU that these places differ; they are worlds apart.\n\nI go to meet Mark Williams, the Lib Dem MP for Ceredigion (one of the eight to hang on to their seats in 2015). When I arrive at his office near the promenade in Aberystwyth, he is just finishing a meeting with a former lady mayoress who tells me she was instrumental in twinning the town with Kronberg im Taunus in Germany (an odd twin since it is several hundred miles from the coast). Aberystwyth, she says, is proud of its twin cities in Germany, France and Patagonia. In Romford, no one had mentioned being twinned with anyone, and I fantasise that it stands proudly alone. But I discover later that it is twinned \u2013 with Ludwigshafen am Rhein in Germany and Hesdin in France. Havering council even trumpets the connection as helping \u201cto foster understanding and tolerance by giving people from participating towns the chance to learn about another culture, language, history and way of life\u201d.\n\nWilliams explains why his constituency is the most Europhile in Britain. \u201cThe influence of the universities [Lampeter to the south as well as Aberystwyth itself] is significant. We have been an enriched, cosmopolitan community for a very long time, and there are enduring links with the universities.\u201d Williams studied politics at Aberystwyth in the 1980s and fell in love with the town. \u201cSecond,\u201d he says, \u201cthere is a hard financial realisation that this constituency and west Wales more generally are heavily dependent [on the EU] financially. Cardies [the residents of the old county of Cardiganshire] have a reputation for being mindful of the pennies, so this is an essential argument. We\u2019ve been eligible for convergence funding for the past 17 years, and you can\u2019t go to any village or community in this constituency where there isn\u2019t the European emblem up somewhere for a project that\u2019s been directly funded by the EU.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Williams MP. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nHe says the enthusiasm for Brussels reflects a feeling that the UK government has let west Wales down. \u201cPeople see Europe as having looked after them, where sometimes Whitehall has failed. That is a question the no campaigners are going to have to answer \u2013 what happens next? A sunny day in Aberystwyth and people forget there are significant pockets of deprivation across this area.\u201d\n\nThe people who stand to lose most if the UK withdraws from the EU are the farmers, who depend on European subsidies to see them through. \u201cSmall family farms in the uplands operate very much on the margins,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to operate under a subsidy regime, but we are where we are, and if that rug was taken away it would rip out the rural economy on which this area relies.\u201d\n\nAt the headquarters of the Farmers\u2019 Union of Wales a few miles outside Aberystwyth, the union\u2019s president Glyn Roberts says leaving the EU would be a disaster for local farming. \u201cAbout 30% of Welsh lamb is exported to Europe,\u201d he explains, \u201cand if we lose that market it would have a devastating effect on our prices. At the moment we have free trade with Europe and don\u2019t pay any tariffs. But if we exit Europe, we will pay tariffs yet still have to operate within the rules and regulations [of the EU].\u201d It would, he says, be the worst of all worlds.\n\nAs well as the impact on exports, Roberts says the withdrawal of subsidies would undermine the whole rural economy. \u201cHistory says that whatever party is governing in Westminster, they won\u2019t be giving farmers the same amount of money as Europe does. The agricultural vote counts for less in Britain than in Europe. Some people criticise the French, but for agriculture those French farmers are our friends.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Students Dan Hooper and Rebecca Hopkins. Photograph: Gareth Phillips/The Guardian\n\nNicholas Fenwick, the FUW\u2019s head of policy, says the average Welsh farmer receives around \u00a311,000 a year through the common agricultural policy \u2013 equivalent to four-fifths of a farmer\u2019s income. But a farm contributes an average of about \u00a3100,000 a year to the local economy, and two out of every five businesses in rural Wales are involved in farming. \u201cWithout agriculture,\u201d says Fenwick, \u201ceverything\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nOut on the sunny streets of Aberystwyth \u2013 where I get shat on by the town\u2019s killer seagulls no fewer than three times \u2013 there is widespread support for staying in the EU, especially among the young. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of poverty around here,\u201d says Kirk Holland, another former student who has stayed on in the town, \u201cand we get a lot of subsidies from the EU.\u201d He says he will vote to stay in, not least because he doesn\u2019t trust the Westminster government on human rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-EU,\u201d says law student Rebecca Hopkins. \u201cWhat are we going to do if we leave the EU? We lose trade, we lose immigrants, we lose everything. People shit on the immigrants that come here from the EU, but they give a lot more than they take. Ukip are clinging to a dead, decaying idea of nationalism. We\u2019re not Great Britain any more. We don\u2019t rule the world. We\u2019re just a tiny island that needs to make positive relations.\u201d Her expletive is unfortunate, as a few minutes earlier her companion Dan Hooper had been splatted on the side of the head by a seagull. \u201cDon\u2019t wipe it off,\u201d she instructs him. \u201cLet it dry.\u201d\n\nThe super-confident Hopkins is unusual among the people I speak to. Most, in both Aberystwyth and Romford, are trying to protect something. In Wales, the farmers are seeking to maintain the subsidies that underpin the local economy. In Romford, the old East Enders are hankering after a close-knit, defiantly English way of life that is almost defunct. The two sides are approaching the referendum defensively, voting in a bid to maintain the world they know. It is why the debate is being played out in the language of fear rather than hope. Only the students, who have no economic interests to defend and welcome a cosmopolitan future, reach beyond the negativity. There will be a lot of metaphorical seagull crap thrown over the next few months, and the best advice may indeed be to ignore it.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a921ad6cef127b201aa688aa13641089e022b2c/0_0_3840_5760/master/3840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0f143d5d4e97c668f7bddfb99fd7f956", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b9f397f9baf6aad9d2e2b9be6b9101124eab88e/0_360_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bd933faf72be418da3a1a556ffb3d629", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e9d8e9a3368cb922db22964c3c1d4f1f7dc0523/0_0_4096_6144/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=53071b4d738a7f61da9bb5c8a796e42c", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CPolitics%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CWales", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12221afd861f3d910d8a50de3d0c14eb8f769ba9/0_1190_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c43f4aaee73fc89ea4cfb37cf432292", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98de662c3c15ab618970359fddef00f5fcf2d2e6/0_0_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ad43e60529178834557e1fe15e57d5d2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a053dfc2b52b872cbf74f8341cc2c7a46a03725/0_0_6046_3628/master/6046.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23d1c9d06d1b20de21b85b98216e99ed", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98de662c3c15ab618970359fddef00f5fcf2d2e6/0_0_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b86f320f996c314c3955545e7cc7131", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Stephen-Moss,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=328b92e71e0d150dec1226d6fc09dae1", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98de662c3c15ab618970359fddef00f5fcf2d2e6/0_0_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b86f320f996c314c3955545e7cc7131", "date": "14/03/2016"}, "rank_172": {"title": "Brexit is a feminist issue", "text": "Women\u2019s voices are not being heard enough in either the Leave or Remain camps. But with more women than men currently undecided, aren\u2019t they likely to tip the balance on 23 June?\n\nIn 1975, campaigners for Britain to leave the European Economic Community \u2013 as it was then \u2013 hit upon a brilliant wheeze to put a woman at the centre of the debate. \u201cIn Coventry, they got a \u2018new Lady Godiva\u2019 to ride through the town on the basis that Lady Godiva was against food taxes,\u201d says Robert Saunders of Queen Mary University in London, who is writing a book about the referendum vote in 1975. But the stunt was beset with problems: first, Godiva had to wear a bodystocking before the police would allow it. \u201cShe also had a hard time because she\u2019d never ridden a horse before, and behind her was a man banging Jamaican drums,\u201d adds Saunders. \u201cThe horse bolted.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s last referendum on Europe was marked by the kind of unthinking sexism that makes the 1970s seem very remote\n\nIt was a campaign that now makes the 1970s seem very remote. The Daily Mirror hired Beverley Pilkington, a Page 3 model who later became the face of Big D Nuts, to front its coverage; newspapers showed girls in tight T-shirts reading: \u201cEurope or bust\u201d. A Swedish model called Siv posed in a bikini adorned with the flags of the member states to drum up interest in the subject. The Mirror called her a \u201ccurvy kind of flagpole who enjoys dressing up to the nines\u201d.\n\nThe pro-European side set up a women\u2019s office to counter this sexism, and under the guidance of Lady Kina Avebury and Anne Money-Coutts it worked with the Women\u2019s Institute and Townswomen\u2019s Guilds across the country to put out a female-focused message. Polling early in the year had indicated that women were more Eurosceptic than men, but they also said their allegiances were softer. In the end, the campaigning of the women\u2019s office helped swing the referendum resoundingly in favour of continued membership.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Conservative MP Priti Patel: \u2018Women can decide the outcome.\u2019 Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nFast-forward four decades and no one is likely to dress up as Lady Godiva \u2013 although Boris Johnson does have the requisite flowing blond locks \u2013 but there are two significant echoes of 1975. Polling shows women are more likely to say they are undecided over the vote in June, and women\u2019s voices are still under-represented in the debate over the EU.\n\nWhat EU cartoonists think of Brexit Read more\n\nSo far, we have had rallies headlined by Nigel Farage and George Galloway; dreary press conferences held by M&S\u2019s former chief executive, Stuart Rose; the media circus surrounding Boris Johnson\u2019s weekend-long tease; the row over the sacking of the British Chambers of Commerce leader, John Longworth; the possibility of the London mayor and George Osborne going head to head in a televised debate. At times, it has all felt a bit... saloon bar.\n\nThe sheer number of self-important Eurosceptic male backbenchers huffing about sovereignty, migration or Project Fear has made even their own side concerned. One Leave advocate tells me he worries about the debate being dominated by the \u201cmen in green ties\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Grassroots Out (Go!) campaign. Another confides: \u201cIf I see [conservative MP] Bill Cash coming down the corridor, my heart sinks.\u201d\n\nIt did not help that the only woman to make the front pages in the first days after David Cameron concluded his renegotiation was the actor \u2013 sorry, \u201cpro-EU luvvie\u201d \u2013 Emma Thompson, being told to \u201cshut yer cakehole\u201d by the Sun for calling Britain a \u201ccake-filled, misery-laden, grey old island\u201d. (The paper even Photoshopped Thompson with a Victoria sponge in her open mouth to ram the point home.) We had to wait until 8 March for another prominent woman\u2019s views on Europe to give the Sun a splash \u2013 the Queen, apparently backing Brexit.\n\nAnders Breivik: the worst endorsement in Europe? Read more\n\nThis imbalance has not gone unnoticed. That said, if you were feeling waspish, you might conclude that women\u2019s major contribution to the EU debate so far has been to say that more women should contribute to the EU debate. On 27 January, Caroline Lucas of the Greens called out the abundance of \u201cmen in grey suits\u201d. On 1 February, Barbara Judge, chair of the Institute of Directors, asked if \u201cwomen had been sidelined or have chosen to absent themselves from the debate\u201d. On 1 March, Labour\u2019s Mary Creagh warned we should not leave the decision to the \u201cold boys\u2019 club\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Green party leader Natalie Bennett: \u2018It\u2019s a Tory leadership contest masquerading as an EU debate.\u2019 Photograph: LNP/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThere is a reason for all this angst. In January, research from the thinktank British Future found that women were much more likely to say they were undecided about how to vote in June than men. This mirrors previous votes such as the Scottish independence referendum. Then, says Rosie Campbell, professor of politics at Birkbeck University, women were a key group of swing voters and, in the end, they \u201cbroke\u201d for No, the winning side.\n\nThat said, Ben Shimshon and Cordelia Hay at BritainThinks sound a note of caution about over-interpreting their data. Women might not be more indecisive or ignorant, but they are \u2013 to put it frankly \u2013 more likely to admit ignorance or indecision to pollsters. (In previous research, 15% of respondents claimed to have heard of a nonexistent government minister. Men were far more likely to bluff than women.)\n\nWomen report being turned off by aggressive, overconfident shouting matches ... they want more nuance, more facts\n\nHowever, in focus groups, women do report being turned off by aggressive, overconfident shouting matches. They often talk about wanting more nuance, more facts and more calm. \u201cWhen I do telephone canvassing, men give you the benefit of their opinion at great length,\u201d the Eurosceptic Labour MP Gisela Stuart tells me. \u201cWhereas women say: I need to know more. There\u2019s a reluctance to assert a view that comes from the gut.\u201d\n\nStuart says her decision to campaign for Leave was driven by realising that the EU would never change. \u201cIn all my years of doing politics, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve come across a debate which is, at heart, as ideological as this. It\u2019s like a statement of faith. When people say, \u2018I would like to stay in a reformed European Union\u2019, I say, \u2018So would I. But it seems incapable of reform.\u2019\u201d\n\nReluctance to get involved in such a fierce argument is common among the women \u2013 from all walks of life \u2013 who volunteered to speak to me about the EU referendum.\n\n\u201cAs usual in politics, there are too many dicks on the dancefloor,\u201d says Emily Hier, 24, a marketer from Blackheath, using a Flight of the Conchords reference that will resonate with many millennials, but few of those are involved in the EU campaigns. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve just seen a load of men in suits sound off about immigration and I\u2019m already bored of the entire thing.\u201d\n\nJane Poole, 44, a Waitrose partner from Harpenden, says she is still undecided and the current debate is not helping her make up her mind. \u201cI would like to know about the day-to-day workings of the EU and its impact on us \u2013 in business, the courts and Westminster,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWhat would replace the rules and regulations and layers of decision-making currently comprising the workings of the union? Also, would Brexit mean that everyone would follow suit?\u201d\n\nNicola, 27, a doctor in Edinburgh, agrees: \u201cI don\u2019t mind the sausage fest per se, but what would sway me would be someone with a plan looking more than approximately five years ahead.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shahlaa Tahira, DJ: \u2018People making the argument do not represent Britain.\u2019 Photograph: Shahlaa Tahira\n\nFor many, men\u2019s domination of the debate is a symptom of a larger problem \u2013 that the conversation seems to be happening among an elite that is remote from the rest of the country. \u201cI definitely feel the people making the argument do not represent Britain. I think the press need to get coverage of female spokespeople who have honest, real opinions,\u201d says Shahlaa Tahira, 25, a DJ from south-east London. \u201cWhat about someone who came to England as an immigrant and is now running a successful business, or a female farm owner, or someone who trades with partners in the EU?\u201d\n\nOr as Alison Cawley, 54, a former headhunter from Taunton, puts it: \u201cI am tired of debates between man one and man two, both trotting out predigested \u2018lines to take\u2019 and sounding about as authentically engaged as a speak-your-weight machine... Given that politics and business are still dominated by white middle-aged men, it\u2019s not surprising that theirs are the dominant voices here.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem is that the EU debate has become subsumed into a preview of the next Tory leadership contest. And with 100 Conservative MPs expected to vote against their own leader\u2019s position, everyone is on high alert for interventions that could bolster a \u201cTory civil war\u201d narrative. That means more men having a say, because the Conservative party has just 68 female MPs, and there are only seven women in the Cabinet.\n\nThere is also an ongoing tussle between broadcasters and the Leave and Remain campaigns over who is offered airtime to make their case. The campaigns complain that television and radio producers want the big hitters, who are predominantly male \u2013 Johnson, Osborne, Cameron \u2013 or mavericks like Farage or Galloway, who can be relied on to say something incendiary. The broadcasters counter by noting that several prominent women seem to be taking a back seat.\n\n\u201cThe Out campaign do seem to have a number of strong women appearing in the media, such as Priti Patel, Gisela Stuart, Theresa Villiers,\u201d one senior TV producer told me. \u201cBut where are the big hitters from Remain? It would be good to hear from Theresa May.\u201d\n\nAnother problem is that whenever the SNP\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon enters the fray, the story tends to become about what a vote to leave would mean for Scotland\u2019s continued membership of the UK. Under those circumstances, it\u2019s hard for her to be an effective advocate for Remain.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ukip deputy chairman, Suzanne Evans: \u2018We\u2019ll turn to the bureaucratic elite and say: We\u2019re just not into EU\u2019 Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA\n\nBoth Leave and Remain are aware there is a problem with the lack of women\u2019s voices. And so International Women\u2019s Day on 8 March saw the launch of both the Women For Britain and Women For In campaigns.\n\nThe first was held in the wood-panelled splendour of One Great George Street, just around the corner from the House of Commons. It featured Ukip\u2019s Suzanne Evans as chair, and a panel of two Tory MPs (including the cabinet minister Priti Patel) and two business owners. The independent-minded Conservative backbencher Sarah Wollaston told me over tea and pastries that she found the \u201cdogmatic\u201d nature of the debate off-putting, and that she had agonised over her decision to back the Leave side. \u201cThe question is whether staying in the EU makes us safer,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced it does.\u201d\n\nLater, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the Tory MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, told the room that \u201cwomen want to understand and cast a considered, thoughtful decision. I\u2019m not a big fan of some of the fisticuffs.\u201d She said she hoped to \u201cempower women to ask stupid questions... and to vote\u201d.\n\nUnexpectedly, a recurring theme was equalities legislation \u2013 not something you often find a room full of Ukip and Tory supporters and small-business owners praising. Evans reassured the audience that leaving the EU would not mean junking employment protections and rights such as maternity leave. She also tried a joke: \u201cWe\u2019ll turn round to the bureaucratic elite and say: We\u2019re just not into EU.\u201d\n\nPriti Patel\u2019s speech, given with one eye on the Tory leadership race, invoked a host of outspoken British women: Boudicca, Elizabeth I, Florence Nightingale, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the codebreakers at Bletchley and the suffragette leader, Emmeline Pankhurst. \u201cThe suffragettes fought for our democratic freedom. Now we are the ones who must fight to protect it,\u201d said Patel. The referendum was \u201cone where women can decide the outcome. When women come out to vote, they come out to win.\u201d\n\nLater that day, the atmosphere at the Women for In launch was more relaxed \u2013 younger and more informal. Upstairs at the Hospital Club in Covent Garden, the TV presenter June Sarpong lauded the cross-party panel \u2013 Conservative cabinet minister Nicky Morgan; leader of the Green party, Natalie Bennett; Labour MP Stella Creasy; Catherine Mayer of the Women\u2019s Equality party \u2013 and instructed them to hug. Sarpong had earlier told me she had been persuaded to become one of the faces of the Remain side because \u201cas a mother, I\u2019m really grateful for the rights the EU has allowed us to get\u201d.\n\nAt the launch, the suffragettes won another shoutout, with Morgan proclaiming: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear what they were fighting for... it was real power, having a real voice.\u201d Morgan declared, too, that gender equality was enshrined in the EU\u2019s founding document, the Treaty of Rome. Bennett said that the campaign so far had been a \u201cturn-off\u201d because it was \u201ca Tory leadership contest masquerading as an EU debate\u201d. Having women involved was vital because \u201cpolitics should be something you do, not something that\u2019s done to you\u201d. And Creasy responded directly to Patel\u2019s attempt to claim the Pankhursts by declaring that \u201cwalking away isn\u2019t the spirit of the suffragettes, it\u2019s the spirit of surrendered wives... Women are going to decide it. There are more of us, and we\u2019re undecided.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nicky Morgan: \u2018Let\u2019s be clear what [the suffragettes] were fighting for ... having a real voice.\u2019 Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nCreasy told me afterwards: \u201cWe know that Europe made a difference on maternity rights, on workers\u2019 rights, on tackling crime, on protecting the environment. The question is: what do we want it to do next?\u201d\n\nMorgan also told me that broadening the conversation was important, to stop the debate seeming too bureaucratic. \u201cLet\u2019s not just talk about business, but other things women are interested in,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the need for women\u2019s voices to be represented in the debate, then, there is widespread agreement. But the wider question \u2013 how to make an argument that appeals to undecided female voters \u2013 is harder. Kirsten Oswald of the SNP chuckled when I mentioned Patronising Better Together Lady, an ad during the Scottish referendum in which a harassed mother sat in her kitchen and complained that the debate was all going over her head. One Labour MP groaned when I brought up Harriet Harman\u2019s Pink Bus tour during the May election campaign.\n\nJustine Roberts of Mumsnet believes that far from being ignorant or uninterested, many women are simply unenthused by the partisan shouting. \u201cScotland\u2019s referendum provoked incredibly intense debate on Mumsnet, and conversations about the EU referendum are following a similar pattern,\u201d she says. \u201cThose who say they could still change their mind \u2013 which is a considerable minority \u2013 are on the hunt for reliable, unbiased information from trustworthy sources, and seem to be finding it difficult to come by.\u201d\n\nBen Shimshon and Cordelia Hay of BritainThinks say it\u2019s important to remember that the idea of a big gender gap in Euroscepticism is not borne out by the figures. Other factors, such as age, location and educational background have far more impact. In fact, Shimshon tells me, there is one question that is better than any other in predicting how you will vote in the forthcoming referendum: did you go to university? Graduates lean towards Remain, while nongraduates skew heavily towards Leave. (He also points out this complicates the picture of older voters being more Eurosceptic: they are from a generation where only one in 10 Britons went to university.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Labour MP Stella Creasy: \u2018Let\u2019s not just talk about business, but other things women are interested in.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian\n\nSo perhaps there is no need to target women voters along gender-interest lines at all? Kate Hoey, another Labour Eurosceptic, tends to agree. \u201cI don\u2019t like too much emphasis on \u2018this is a women\u2019s issue\u2019, because I think we\u2019ve gone past that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they do feel the country has changed a lot, particularly older women, and they don\u2019t have the influence they once did.\u201d However, she cites the \u201ctampon tax\u201d \u2013 a campaign to scrap the VAT levied on sanitary products \u2013 as a feminist cause that is inextricably connected with the EU. \u201cEven if we wanted to put [the VAT rate] down to nothing, we would have to go through the whole mechanism of getting the whole EU to agree to that,\u201d she says.\n\nIn light of the potential to come across as patronising, the pitch to women as women on both Leave and Remain is very tightly focused: maternity rights (enabled by the EU or achieved without the EU\u2019s help, depending on your persuasion); the broader equalities agenda; and the fundamental right to have your voice heard. As Creasy puts it, for women \u201cthe same arguments will appeal about equality, but they might appeal in a different way because it\u2019s your lived experience of not being in the room and not being able to make decisions\u201d.\n\nWomen\u2019s campaigns allow networks to form and help to uncover women from business, science and other industries\n\nThere will be no repeat of the rhetoric of the 1975 referendum, where a government pamphlet declared that \u201cthe Common Agricultural policy (known as CAP) now works more flexibly to the benefit of both housewives and farmers in Britain\u201d. Politicians are also now wary of conflating \u201cwomen\u201d and \u201cmothers\u201d, perhaps unsurprisingly, given that one in five British women now is childless by the age of 45.\n\nDespite all this, the women\u2019s campaigns allow networks to form, and help to uncover women from the worlds of business, science and other industries who will speak at meetings and in the media. They provide broadcasters seeking to diversify their pool of interviewees with an easy port of call. And they provide grassroots energy for campaigning around the country: Amina Lone, the north-west coordinator for Britain Stronger in Europe, sends me a photograph from a packed meeting in Newtown, Birmingham on 28 February. The majority of attendees are black and Asian, and pride of place at the front goes to two women in colourful hijabs \u2013 a very different image of the debate to the one you often see.\n\nFor all our sakes, let\u2019s hope that some of that diversity filters back into the media \u201cair war\u201d and makes the debate seem more inclusive before 23 June. And let\u2019s hope both sides give women what they want: facts. As Lucy Guy, a television scriptwriter from Hackney, tells me: \u201cI will apparently die a bitter old lady before I get an answer as to how much of our laws are made by the EU and how much we have control over... I\u2019ve got lots of questions and will be trying to hunt down answers over the next few months.\u201d The last word goes to Jane Poole, who is even more withering in her assessment of the quality of debate so far: \u201cI really do feel that referendums are not really for the people.\u201d\n\nHelen Lewis is the deputy editor of the New Statesman.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 21 March 2016 to correct the spelling of Alison Cawley\u2019s name.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89efb310f9af199f2bdf778d03729a4ff479fe65/16_74_3735_2241/master/3735.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fce1a44f1aa1de75ab384113f9fdaaa3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a345f040212d7db36485f282bd1d8551a3d55247/0_100_2126_1274/master/2126.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e12c7ee34f9bc6dbe4e2714e56f88375", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b412d1547a5c92d4a3011f08fd574054a7393aa/0_264_1782_1070/master/1782.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9350f84f12f459609e70b54002f4cade", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Women+in+politics%2CBrexit%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CWomen%2CGender%2CPolitics", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4dbefd84a8f6c1d5942542150b1ef3f02a35aee/231_125_1035_1034/master/1035.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=74dc792d11d50317210a6b69bac0e7cc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/373e128477a17f8eebfd147255ebe919c190ed66/1027_515_1175_1762/667.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ecbf8abead7142b2aa38f72189d0f245", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a345f040212d7db36485f282bd1d8551a3d55247/0_100_2126_1274/master/2126.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4555ead39a3e0e715f02bf054dc3aca9", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8807adb9f8d688381483aef54bb3948455c5f7d/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=35778be251e1b030ecf9af3e0f3f46e6", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b696d17d452e7f82a072245c851560c6ce5a7e34/0_98_2293_1374/master/2293.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=98ba803702435b05d22eac31d36a1d31"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a345f040212d7db36485f282bd1d8551a3d55247/0_100_2126_1274/master/2126.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e12c7ee34f9bc6dbe4e2714e56f88375", "date": "20/03/2016"}, "rank_126": {"title": "National newspapers continue to act as Brexit propagandists", "text": "The Observer, in a front page article about an opinion poll, contended that the result was \u201ca blow to David Cameron and the pro-EU camp\u201d.\n\nIt found 43% in favour of Brexit compared to 39% saying they will vote to remain in the European Union. The other 18% of voters who took part in the online survey by Opinium were \u201cundecided.\u201d\n\nIf the poll was accurate, and it does appear to reflect findings elsewhere, that 18% now holds the fate of Britain\u2019s EU membership in their hands.\n\nSadly, one key question not asked of the 1,966 people interviewed by the pollsters, was their prime news provider. It would be fascinating to know whether they read a daily national newspaper and, if so, which title or titles.\n\nMeanwhile, a large slice of the press continues to churn out pro-Brexit propaganda. Even on Monday, a day when the news was dominated by the Panama tax haven revelations and the Port Talbot steel crisis, the insistent anti-EU messages were evident.\n\nAs so often since Cameron announced that the referendum would take place on 23 June editors and commentators have chosen to link immigration to the future of Britain\u2019s membership.\n\nBoth the Daily Mail and the Sun carried prominent page 2 articles about the coming release of Office of National Statistics figures about the scale of EU migration to Britain. It featured also on the Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page.\n\nThe \u201cU-turn\u201d was \u201ca major victory for the Daily Mail\u201d, said the Mail article. And the Sun, in a piece headlined \u201c1.3m Brexit bombshell\u201d, pointed out that the \u201csecret figures\u201d will appear in late May, four weeks before the referendum vote.\n\nA Mail spread, \u201cBritain \u2018will thrive after Brexit\u2019\u201d, was based on claims made by a \u201cTory high-flier\u201d, energy minister Andrea Leadsom, accompanied by her own article urging a leave vote.\n\nFor a good measure, a third piece, \u201cRattled Cameron\u2019s bizarre rant\u201d, reported that the prime minister was \u201cclaiming a slew of bad headlines are all the media\u2019s fault.\u201d Doh!\n\nThen came a leading article, \u201cThe public is seeing through Project Fear\u201d, which claimed that people are becoming \u201cheartily sick of this cynical scaremongering.\u201d\n\nIt praised Leadsom for articulating \u201cwhat millions already know - that unfettered migration from within the EU has put enormous strain on schools, the NHS, jobs and housing.\u201d\n\nThe Sun ran an op-ed piece by Trevor Kavanagh, \u201cEU fans Cam needs don\u2019t care enough\u201d, in which he was critical of the prime minister and \u201cEU rules\u201d that prevent the government from propping up the British steel industry or insisting that British firms use British steel.\n\nCameron\u2019s pro-EU battle \u201cnow consumes every minute of his waking day\u201d, wrote Kavanagh. Yet \u201cEurope\u2019s tentacles stretch into the nooks and crannies of our everyday lives\u201d. He also referred to \u201cthe dead hand of Brussels\u201d.\n\nThe Sun\u2019s editorial also berated Cameron. He \u201cis so pre-occupied with keeping us in the EU that he seems to have forgotten the governing bit of being PM\u201d, it said.\n\nThe Daily Express chose to highlight the Observer\u2019s poll in its main news item on the EU while its editorial, in greeting 4% lead, noted the fact that young people are far more committed than their elders to Brussels.\n\nSo, it said to readers, \u201ctell the younger ones in your family exactly why they must vote to leave the EU.\u201d\n\nBoth the Times and the Daily Telegraph are more ambivalent in their approach of late. After years of pursuing an Eurosceptic agenda, the Daily Telegraph is now facing both ways over the EU referendum.\n\nIt ran a page 1 piece on the coming release of \u201ctrue\u201d immigration statistics while leading its business section with a claim by the London stock exchange chief executive, Xavier Rolet, that Brexit would spell \u201cthe end of the European Union.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgain, the paper is guilty of conflating the plight of Syrian and Iraqi refugees with the EU debate, simply by association. Its editorial, \u201cEU\u2019s critical moment\u201d, registered \u201cdeep scepticism\u201d the policy of transporting refugees frim Greece to Turkey.\n\n\u201cIf this scheme fails to stem the flow of migration into Europe this summer,\u201d said the Telegraph, \u201cthe crisis can only deepen.\u201d\n\nThen, of course, there is the paper\u2019s resident Brexiteer, Boris Johnson. His Monday column linked the Port Talbot crisis to government controls \u201csupinely\u201d surrendered \u201cas part of our membership of the EU.\u201d\n\nHe accused the EU of exacerbating problems because \u201cwe must not only accept that about 60% of our legislation \u2013 primary and secondary \u2013 comes from the EU. We must also accept a fatal loss of flexibility, an inability to take decisions that might be in our national interest.\u201d Johnson wrote:\n\n\u201cAt every turn we have the problem of the EU, and the objections of Brussels to anything that looks like state aids. Even when we are trying to address our home-grown mistakes, even when we are simply trying to bring down our energy costs so that they are more in line with the rest of the EU, we face the same difficulty: we no longer call the shots, even when thousands of jobs are at stake. When this referendum campaign began, and I said that the key issue was sovereignty, I remember people giving me pitying looks. No one cares about sovereignty, they said. Well, losing sovereignty is just a fancy way of talking about losing control \u2013 and I think people care passionately about it.\u201d\n\nBut does the Telegraph now feel passionately about it? It would appear not. Similarly, although Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun feels passionately about EU membership, his Times is more even-handed\n\nSo one page lead, \u201cBrexit would put the NHS at risk, health leaders say\u201d is balanced by another page lead, \u201cEU rules could block steel rescue\u201d.\n\nA leading article was sceptical about the EU-Turkey deal. If it collapses, which the Times suggests may occur, then \u201cEurope\u2019s lack of urgency over the past fortnight will be seen, rightly, as a tragic missed opportunity.\u201d Readers\u2019 comments were, in the main, notably negative about the EU and all its works.\n\nIncidentally, the anti-Brexit Guardian also devoted its leading article to the deporting of refugees and migrants from Greece to Turkey, arguing that \u201cit is a moment that may come to reshape what we understand by Europe.\u201d\n\nIt agreed with the UNHCR special representative, Peter Sutherland, who argued at the weekend that the deal risked breaching international law.\n\n\u201cGreek officials are promising to be sensitive in their implementation of deportations,\u201d it concluded. \u201cThey \u2013 and the rest of the EU \u2013 have Europe\u2019s reputation in their hands.\u201d Indeed, they do. And, quite possibly, they also hold the outcome of Britain\u2019s EU referendum in their hands too.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b504b3f9d14b66bdbbf9d8ecb38a7545ed34dec5/0_0_3500_2104/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9baace2bfdc179488b3bc8837a2d7848", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Roy-Greenslade,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15b48b8e4b6744294489e71d4bfe931f", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Media%2CBrexit%2CDavid+Cameron%2CNational+newspapers%2CThe+Observer%2CThe+Guardian%2CThe+Times%2CDaily+Telegraph%2CBoris+Johnson%2CEurope%2CTata%2CPolitics%2CThe+Sun%2CDaily+Mail%2CDaily+Express%2CTrevor+Kavanagh%2CTurkey%2CGreece%2CNewspapers%2CWorld+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b504b3f9d14b66bdbbf9d8ecb38a7545ed34dec5/0_0_3500_2104/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5f34b0f2328410d44d65a73423fd3a46", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b504b3f9d14b66bdbbf9d8ecb38a7545ed34dec5/0_0_3500_2104/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5f34b0f2328410d44d65a73423fd3a46", "date": "04/04/2016"}, "rank_40": {"title": "'Politicians have lost our trust': readers on the Dutch referendum", "text": "I was born and raised in the countryside and moved to Amsterdam when I started going to university there. Because of my background I pretty much feel like I live in two worlds. The Netherlands may be small, but differences between the urban and rural regions are probably as big as they are anywhere. I\u2019m very pleased with the result, which reflects the outcome of the referendum held in 2005 with regard to the European constitution. That result also shows that Eurosceptic sentiments have been present for a long time. I do not necessarily see an increase. Instead, there might be more awareness among politicians that Dutch voters are sceptic about a political union with other countries, especially countries we lack common ground with. There was a 27.2 percent turnout in Amsterdam and a majority, 53.1 percent, voted for the treaty. This is in line with the impression I got, although I have to say that most of my friends and colleagues did not have a strong opinion on the matter.\n\nIt has become clear from polls that Dutch citizens with a lower educational background voted overwhelmingly against the treaty and that those with a higher educational background were divided. I come from a small town outside of the urban regions of the Netherlands and the EU sentiment is radically different there from the sentiment held within the cities, with the exception of Rotterdam. Also worth noting a large percentage of citizens didn\u2019t vote because they felt politicians would discard the outcome anyway.\n\nThe Netherlands does not have a single-issue, anti-EU party. Those who would like to vote against the EU have to choose between the far-right of Geert Wilders or the far-left parties. For voters like me, who thoroughly disagree with other opinions held by members of these parties, a referendum is a great opportunity to express anti-EU sentiments and to deliver the message that something has to change.\n\nA discussion has started in The Netherlands about the referendum itself as a democratic instrument.

It is a topic far removed from his comfort zone and he has long viewed Euroscepticism as Kryptonite to Conservative electoral chances. In his first conference speech as leader, he criticised fellow Tories for \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d, and the painful memories of his formative years as a special adviser in the 1990s loom large.\n\nMany close to him had similar experiences of the Major and Hague years, and the letters \u201cEU\u201d inevitably spark loud alarms in their minds blaring the words \u201csplits\u201d and \u201cdefeat\u201d.\n\nGiven that background, the Downing Street grid for the official beginning of the referendum campaign will have been inked in with heavy foreboding. \u201cBanging on about Europe\u201d, pro or anti, is inevitably the order of the day.\n\nDespite that apprehension, the past fortnight has proved more uncomfortable than expected. The Panama Papers were unrelated to the EU, but bogged the prime minister down in a personal battle. Just as the pro-EU campaign was meant to kick off, Cameron, its greatest asset, faced allegations about his family finances. It wasn\u2019t the start he would have wished for.\n\nNews of the government\u2019s decision to spend \u00a39.3m on leaflets and online adverts in favour of a Remain vote was smuggled out of No 10 late one weekday evening, but still went down about as well as a Jeremy Corbyn speech on the floor of the London stock exchange. Tory MPs railed against attempts to fix the referendum and grassroots Eurosceptics have been galvanised into action by the perceived unfairness.\n\nSuch resentment in Conservative circles is dangerous for the party itself. Zealous Remainers such as Matthew Parris accuse their opponents of \u201cmadness\u201d, caricaturing them as \u201cspittle-flecked\u201d adolescents. Others still maintain that Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s resignation was motivated by Euroscepticism, despite all the evidence that it was a belated reaction to a bullying Treasury.\n\nOn the other side, some Tory Leavers have lost all trust in Downing Street. Last week some suggested that stale revelations about John Whittingdale\u2019s private life came to light conveniently soon after the culture secretary declared for Vote Leave.\n\nThe renegotiation is no longer mentioned, given how it fell to pieces under closer scrutiny, and now some seek to question if Cameron can credibly negotiate Brexit given his rather hysterical warnings of apocalypse if Britain votes to leave. Ken Clarke, always ready to say the wrong thing in an EU debate, has further inflamed that speculation by declaring that a Leave vote would unseat the PM.\n\nThat line may encourage some of Cameron\u2019s fans to back Remain, but they may also attract frustrated Labour voters to support Leave. While Alan Johnson\u2019s Labour In campaign has won the support of the biggest unions, there are justified concerns that Labour\u2019s core vote is much more Eurosceptic than the party\u2019s Westminster establishment.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s lacklustre case for staying in the EU concluded with a rejection of concerns about migration unlikely to win over Labour voters who are tempted by some of Ukip\u2019s arguments. Johnson revealed that his \u201cplan to win the referendum\u201d by persuading Labour voters to back Remain has a budget of just \u00a375,000, providing more evidence that the opposition\u2019s heart isn\u2019t really in it.\n\nWith the Panama row only now receding, growing annoyance among Tory Eurosceptics and a Labour leader at best half-hearted about the EU, this was far from Cameron\u2019s ideal way of starting the referendum battle.\n\nMark Wallace is executive editor of ConservativeHome", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c77cffbd4e344cdd4cafda1fbb65318c7f7d6ab6/0_0_2465_1478/2465.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c99b67fc83bb7cdb0029f12cd3b31221", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b081cdcd49dfd84b146940965adc8df7986eb6d7/0_119_4584_2750/4584.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=42f7509d1f7a005a3b421727d6c37d1a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9969158beac5a2bc7508c5d1906cddafe673f07f/142_161_2551_1530/2551.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c59f86d67d47f1c20c7e1fef517952fc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe535346396737fab72f5d33c82bdde975b7f224/0_53_4050_2430/4050.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=941c1c0279c3e88f793886a9523ee616", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d4aebd5329e44bb35de05eb55f53195f6a71752/78_138_3422_2053/master/3422.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1690de7b69d74a94f87dbb1a64e9f096", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CDavid+Cameron%2CJeremy+Corbyn%2CConservatives%2CAlan+Johnson%2CKenneth+Clarke%2CConservativeHome", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d4aebd5329e44bb35de05eb55f53195f6a71752/78_138_3422_2053/3422.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dc204ae5906a1cb0296eb18df7085f0f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d4aebd5329e44bb35de05eb55f53195f6a71752/78_138_3422_2053/3422.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dc204ae5906a1cb0296eb18df7085f0f", "date": "16/04/2016"}, "rank_34": {"title": "Brexit recycles the defiant spirit of the Reformation", "text": "Next year, it\u2019s 500 years since the start of the Reformation. On 31 October 1517, Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of All Saints, Wittenberg, targeting corruption at the highest levels of the church. The scandal of which he complained was the sale of forgiveness to finance an ecclesiastical gravy train and lavish building projects such as that of St Peter\u2019s in Rome. From here the Reformation would spread out to become an across-the-board protest at the elitist and centralising philosophy of the Roman church. Here also we find the intellectual roots of Euroscepticism.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to discount this narrative as the preserve of Ian Paisley-like extremists, frothing against the pope as the antichrist.\n\nMoreover, who cares about any of this in an age of secularisation? Well, quite a lot of us, apparently. Research by social scientist Margarete Scherer from the Goethe University in Frankfurt has demonstrated a considerably higher prevalence of Euroscepticism in traditionally Protestant countries than in traditionally Roman Catholic ones. And this should be entirely unsurprising, given that the Reformation was largely a protest about heteronomous power. \u201cThe bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this realm of England\u201d goes the 37th of the 39 articles of religion, still \u2013 officially, at least \u2013 a summary of the theology of the Church of England, of which the Queen is supreme governor.\n\nThe backstory is familiar. In England, Henry VIII opportunistically purloined the pope\u2019s authority under the pretext of localising the power of the church. There was nothing particularly honourable about Henry\u2019s power grab. He just didn\u2019t like being told what to do by some bloke in an Italian city. But freed from Roman authority, the Bible could be translated out of the elitist language of Vatican officialdom and into a vernacular that everyone could understand. And it was from this sense of grassroots empowerment that democracy was revived by the Protestant Levellers.\n\nWith every attempt \u2013 plots, armadas etc \u2013 by the pope to reclaim what he thought of as his, a stubborn commitment to English independence came to be lodged ever more firmly in our intellectual marrow. Nothing equivalent has shaped the intellectual worldview of Catholic countries.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Roman Catholic archbishop of Westminster: \u2018The Catholic stance towards an effort such as the EU is largely supportive.\u2019 Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nAs Cardinal Vincent Nichols said last month: \u201cThere is a long tradition in \u2026 Catholicism of believing in holding things together. So the Catholic stance towards an effort such as the EU is largely supportive.\u201d Of course, the important question is: who does the \u201cholding things together\u201d? And for the cardinal \u2013 theologically, at least \u2013 it\u2019s Rome.\n\nConversely, in Protestant countries, the EU still feels a little like some semi-secular echo of the Holy Roman empire, a bureaucratic monster that, through the imposition of canon law, swallows up difference and seeks after doctrinal uniformity. This was precisely the sort of centralisation that Luther challenged, and resistance to it is deep in the Protestant consciousness. Even David Cameron, despite having been won over to the EU cause, lamely references the need for a \u201creformed EU\u201d \u2013 by which he means an EU with less integration and greater subsidiarity.\n\nAs it happens, the term subsidiarity was originally a theological one. Now associated with John Major and boring debates on European polity, it was minted by the Jesuit theologian Oswald von Nell-Breuning, finding its way into the Maastricht treaty via Catholic social teaching. In a way it was an answer to Luther \u2013 trying to achieve the best of both worlds, localism where needed and centralised authority where necessary.\n\nBut power, once acquired, is rarely returned \u2013 either to God (if you are the pope) or to the people (if you are the EU). \u201cWe would see [Brexit] as something that is not going to make a stronger Europe,\u201d says the Vatican\u2019s foreign minister, Bishop Paul Gallagher, perfectly intoning the pro-EU line. Against this, there are those of us who protest against our laws being crafted by some foreign power, beyond the control of our domestic parliament. Brexit perfectly recycles this defiant spirit of the Reformation.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a48b8a46e5f06dbeee37b4b511891f6b53da930/1508_0_3014_3768/master/3014.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=375ec11232e5234d6f362f073798dbb7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Giles-Fraser,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ffbefe5860fd07078ff99c0e28b3a07f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78655f0102754e024c25f883862d2dc53a3dd75/0_820_5268_3161/5268.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=96dd8468accf6121b10cc53ee670ee4f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78655f0102754e024c25f883862d2dc53a3dd75/0_820_5268_3161/master/5268.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ff4fae6e6f01f2784c51a1e713b610e6", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CAnglicanism%2CChristianity%2CReligion%2CLondon%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CCatholicism%2CEurope"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e78655f0102754e024c25f883862d2dc53a3dd75/0_820_5268_3161/5268.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=96dd8468accf6121b10cc53ee670ee4f", "date": "05/05/2016"}, "rank_10": {"title": "Euroscepticism is a lonely idea without serious foundation | Boris Vezjak", "text": "A few weeks ago the former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis described the position of his Slovenian counterpart Du\u0161an Mramor during the Greek crisis last year as surprisingly hostile, almost bordering on the comical. The Slovenian finance minister was said to be the first one to threaten him with Grexit. As he put it, one seldom encounters such a combination of economic illiteracy and self-defeating hostility.\n\nThis small episode encapsulates typical Slovenian political servility and the sustained complex of inferiority, often compensated for with self-important behaviour, in this instance taking the main initiative when it comes to the questions of Europe\u2019s future. Possibly Slovenia is the last of its members that would decide to leave the safe shelter of European union: to withdraw from it simply cannot become a matter of serious public dispute.\n\nIt is hard to believe that we will ever go to a referendum. Even the controversial Slovenian philosopher Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, always ready to invert the conventional standpoints of the majority into sheer impudence, has come to see more and more hidden advantages of European culture \u2013 especially when it comes to the question of how to treat refugees crossing the old continent.\n\nLast October our premier warned that the EU will face collapse if the bloc cannot agree on a plan to confront the sudden influx of refugees through the Balkans. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find a solution today, if we don\u2019t do everything we can today, then it is the end of the European Union as such,\u201d Miro Cerar said. Such a dramatic call exemplifies not only their fear, but also the fidelity of Slovenian politicians to the EU.\n\nThe country became an independent state in 1991; historically it always used to be a part of bigger national and political entities, dependent on others. The attainment of independence gave the country a strong identification with central Europe and its cultural milieu, running away from its southern neighbours. Slovenia, bordering Austria, Italy, Hungary and Croatia, always felt more naturally European than anything else. The national character is determined by the slave mentality as a result of our history, with some flavour of Nietzschean slave morality, revaluing that which the master \u2013 the EU \u2013 likes to value.\n\nEurope veers to the right at its peril | Srecko Horvat Read more\n\nThere is a strong belief in Slovenia that we cannot possibly remain an island with a population of only 2 million, geographically almost at the heart of Europe yet politically separated. Indeed, upon joining the EU in 2004 there was high economic growth \u2013 most of our trade is with other EU states \u2013 although the economic crash has been felt. Slovenia recorded a public debt at about 83% of the country\u2019s GDP by the end of 2015, which is about \u20ac32bn. It was only 27% in 2004.\n\nWilling or not, we are caught in the economic flows, and the domestic economy would have surely fared worse if we had been isolated and not part of the EU. We may feel discomfort and anger with European politics, yet periodical Euroscepticism is merely a lonely idea without serious foundation. Economists repeat that there is always the opportunity to correct mistakes and make better use of the 500 million-strong European market. The weakness of the smaller nation means it must adapt to the diktats of the biggest.\n\nAlthough it may seem tempting to complain of Brussels bureaucracy and the frequently hopeless rigidity of the political leaders of Europe, it is deeply unjustified. The EU\u2019s failure to cope with the refugee crisis should not mean we have to leave behind the project of inclusive, democratic society; where solidarity, diversity, freedom and equality are cherished and safeguarded. On the contrary, we are facing critical times, when populism and political extremism more and more threaten the democratic and social structures of the EU. The financial crunch has raised some deep doubts about identity and politics. Nevertheless, the European democratic culture must prevail over the efforts of elites: its governance should lead to more egalitarian models than the free-market orthodoxy, and greater solidarity among member states.\n\nWe should remember that the very idea of the EU was to solidify the peaceful union of different states, which had been at war for several centuries and ruined by the tragic consequences of conflict in the first half of the 20th century. In this sense it realised the programme of Immanuel Kant from his essay on perpetual peace, surely one of the fundamentals of contemporary liberal thought. An integrated Europe, with its single market, common rules and a shared framework of human rights and justice, is a legacy worth improving, not abandoning.\n\nThe referendum on the UK\u2019s membership is motivated by an incorrect \u201chomeopathic\u201d doctrine \u2013 namely that more disintegration would cure the processes of disintegration. Leaving is a bad solution and for some members being a part of the group is a matter of plain survival \u2013 in this regard I don\u2019t believe Slovenia can afford the exit, neither economically nor politically. More importantly, I don\u2019t believe Europe as a whole could afford it either.\n\n\u2022 Tell us what the EU means to you and your country", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c131b2a1e61013eef3e2f815263e7bd3f73ec734/0_0_2868_1721/2868.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0d7e55eb50340054175b2fae803f48bc", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c131b2a1e61013eef3e2f815263e7bd3f73ec734/0_0_2868_1721/master/2868.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc65a5b6e05e521f928aab32dd586bf6", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Slovenia%2CEuropean+Union%2CBrexit%2CUK+news%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CEurope%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c131b2a1e61013eef3e2f815263e7bd3f73ec734/0_0_2868_1721/2868.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0d7e55eb50340054175b2fae803f48bc", "date": "23/05/2016"}, "rank_146": {"title": "Whatever happens in this referendum, England\u2019s disquiet is set to get a whole lot worse | John Harris", "text": "A question may have recently popped into your head: why are we having this referendum?

But there is another factor, which takes us deep into some of the most overlooked tensions in British politics: the condition of England, the 4 million largely English people who last year put jump-leads on British Euroscepticism by voting for Ukip, and a set of deep anxieties and annoyances that panics the political class, while looking likely to get a whole lot worse, whatever the outcome.\n\nIn other words, if Cameron thinks the referendum will somehow \u201cresolve\u201d most of the key issues and smooth over England\u2019s ferment, he is even more deluded than he increasingly looks.\n\nGive or take a small crowd of Euro-zealots \u2013 the kind who say things like \u201cI\u2019m more European than British\u201d, subsist on organic food and probably number no more than 20,000 \u2013 most people who are supporting remain are focused on a limited set of economic factors, while being well aware of the EU\u2019s serial shortcomings. But talk to leave voters \u2013 which I have done lately, a lot \u2013 and you will sample a strain of opinion seemingly based in a different part of the human brain: all-or-nothing, visceral and brimming with deep and often completely justified resentments.\n\nIn February, YouGov reported that of 10 areas \u2013 that were all in England \u2013 the UK\u2019s most Eurosceptic place was the borough of Havering, on the London/Essex borders. It\u2019s a place nudging parts of outer London, where the pace of change is relentless, and, according to those who know it, somewhere characterised by a feeling that it will be next. But there is also loathing of the EU in places where London and its surrounding areas feel like a different planet: superficially deadened areas, often in the north, which have never recovered from deindustrialisation and are now locked into a kind of silent decline \u2013 which brings with it a seething disquiet.\n\nOn the outer edges of London and beyond, resentment and loss will still define a big part of the public mood\n\nWhat unites voters in these two contrasting realities is pretty clear. There are obvious intersections of age and ethnicity (old-ish and white, bluntly put). If asked, a lot of them self-identify as being English \u2013 which denotes a bundle of stuff, as much bound up with class as national identity (\u201cEnglish\u201d, in this reading, partly translates as \u201cnot middle class\u201d).\n\nWhen it comes to the EU, immigration, needless to say, is usually in the forefront of their thoughts. Sometimes because they apparently don\u2019t like the idea per se, but more often than not because they feel that it is placing impossible strains on housing and public services, and inflaming the injustices of low-end job markets. But there is also something even more elemental: a conviction that centres of power that seem impossibly distant have let them down, and if there\u2019s a chance to split from the most distant one of all, they will grab it in both hands.\n\nAll of this was underlined yesterday, when the Office for National Statistics released its latest projections of population change in England over the next eight years, and the awful imbalances it will create. By 2024, say the statisticians, the population of London is likely to have grown by another 14%, taking the total figure to 9.7 million. The number of people in Tower Hamlets will rocket by a quarter; in Barking and Dagenham, by nearly 20%. God knows where these extra people will live.\n\nMeanwhile, the figures contain slightly subtler revelations. Between now and 2024, the best part of 2 million people will come to London from elsewhere in England, while 2.6 million will sooner or later go in the other direction, presumably because of the impossible costs of capital living. Aside from those being born in the city, the lion\u2019s share of London\u2019s newest arrivals will therefore be people who have moved there from overseas. The global city-state of some people\u2019s imaginations will be close to reality, but its contrast to other parts of the country will be stark.\n\nWhich brings us to what some call the provinces. The ONS\u2019s website allows you to go through every one of England\u2019s local authority areas, and sample how they will change. In such population centres as Middlesbrough and Hull, the projected figures for population growth markedly lag behind the numbers for \u201cnatural change\u201d, indicating large numbers of people continuing to leave. The same applies to post-industrial Redcar and Cleveland, where there will be no overall growth at all.\n\nAnd in Blackburn and Blackpool (tellingly, numbers four and five in YouGov\u2019s Euroscepticism ranking), and Richmondshire, in North Yorkshire, local populations will fall \u2013 at the same time as an ever-ageing population skews the makeup of the people who will be left. In the north-east, for example, there will be a 20% increase in numbers of people over 65, at the same time as the number of 16- to 64-year-olds falls.\n\nIn socio-political terms, what all this means should be pretty obvious. London will still be endlessly overheating, and the competition for living space in its few supposedly \u201caffordable\u201d areas will be fierce and often toxic. On its outer edges and beyond, particularly in the east, resentment and loss will still define a big part of the public mood. Further afield, most obviously in the north, there will be local and regional economies still dominated by what remains of the public sector, an increasing preponderance of older people \u2013 and a sense of decline that by 2050 will have stretched back nearly a century. None of this will cast mainstream politics in a very edifying light: all that Westminster talk about \u201crebalancing the economy\u201d will look like a series of sick jokes.\n\nIt would be tempting to soak up all those numbers and conclude that England\u2019s stupid imbalances cannot carry on. But at the risk of sounding comically bleak, they can, and they probably will. The result, now and in the future, will be the English manifestation of much the same tensions that are currently tearing through mainland Europe, and a politics that will neither be polite nor controllable. The referendum is symptomatic of these problems, not any kind of solution. And the morning after the big vote \u2013 whatever happens \u2013 they will still be there, simmering away.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28ecd0242509f2a5b4a726cc2dce1a6ae135f9be/0_10_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c61f3eb1591bc64aba57e045ca25edc2", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28ecd0242509f2a5b4a726cc2dce1a6ae135f9be/0_10_5760_3456/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=43226f4d7f1877414be2e3eb07361b7e", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CPoverty%2CSocial+exclusion%2CUK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/06/26/John_Harris_Next_Gen.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=71554a58d52e35724d1464ab0e413199"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28ecd0242509f2a5b4a726cc2dce1a6ae135f9be/0_10_5760_3456/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=43226f4d7f1877414be2e3eb07361b7e", "date": "26/05/2016"}, "rank_70": {"title": "The EU: An Obituary by John R Gillingham \u2013 the neoliberal case against the European Union", "text": "A spectre is haunting Europe \u2013 the spectre of disintegration. The European Union, argues John R Gillingham, is on the verge of \u201ccollapse\u201d, defended only by an alliance of old elites. While we focus on Brexit (which he confidently predicts in a postscript), the issues imperfectly covered in his book suggest that it is a parochial distraction from the much bigger question of how Europe is to be organised in the 21st century. We are at a \u201cturning point\u201d in European history.\n\nEuroscepticism creates some strange bedfellows. Many rightwing nationalists view the EU as a Trojan horse of unstoppable multiculturalism. Some on the left see its focus on the single market as institutionalised \u201cneoliberalism\u201d and austerity. And some \u201cneoliberals\u201d such as Gillingham see it as a relic of the postwar decades that binds free markets in red tape. Gillingham is not a typical author for the radical-left publishing house Verso \u2013 presumably at least one commissioning editor there has Eurosceptic leanings. From all sorts of angles, the EU seems to be the sick man of Europe.\n\nWherever one sits on the political spectrum, many of Gillingham\u2019s charges against today\u2019s EU are fair. It is bloated by bureaucracy and complex inefficiency; it has little democracy and even less transparency; its defence of the single currency has economically punished tens of millions of Europeans; it has benefited and subsidised big corporations and big agribusiness while often neglecting social justice and civil liberties; it has been impotent in Bosnia, Kosovo and Ukraine; and it has let thousands of refugees drown and deported even more. Such an indictment has left even devotees of the European project disillusioned with the status quo. But Gillingham is no impartial judge: his criticism of what he calls the \u201cEurocult\u201d lurches from historical analysis to ideological bias. His EU is something of a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. The \u201cobituary\u201d of the title deems it already dead, but at different points it is instead \u201cdefunct\u201d, \u201cunravelling\u201d, an institution whose history \u201chas run its course\u201d, or which is on its \u201clast chance\u201d and could yet be saved. This is a reflection of both real uncertainty and the disjointed nature of the book.\n\nMuch of Gillingham\u2019s \u201cobituary\u201d focuses on the EU\u2019s 20th-century history, condensing some of the narrative of his much larger history of European integration, published in 2006 (which he frequently footnotes). His discussion of the 1940s and 50s features an alphabet soup of organisations from the EDC (European Defence Community) to the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) to the IRA (International Ruhr Authority). Today\u2019s EU was \u2013 and is \u2013 not the only one possible.\n\nHe offers two major arguments on the EU\u2019s history. First, that the impetus for integration has always come from outside forces: US foreign policy; the Soviet threat; the collapse of the Bretton Woods financial system; globalisation; technology. The influence of these is often elided in a \u201cmyth\u201d of the EU\u2019s complicated origins. Second, he sees a battle between \u201cneoliberalism\u201d and interventionism, in particular in the clashes between Margaret Thatcher and long-time commission president Jacques Delors. His ideological preference for Thatcher\u2019s policies strongly colours his history of the EU from the 1970s onwards.\n\nThis bias is particularly pronounced in Gillingham\u2019s treatment of the EU\u2019s economic history, where he downplays successes: for example, his assessment of the economic impact of the single market is overpessimistic, although expectations of it were unrealistically high, and have been altered by economic change. He is right to criticise the slow integration of communications, energy, and services \u2013 less emphasised in the original single market, but now 75% of the EU economy \u2013 and he laments a possible retrenchment to a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of national markets. The answer to Europe\u2019s slow growth and mass youth unemployment does not lie in re-erecting economic and social borders.\n\nYet how could a single market work without European institutions to oversee it? Gillingham would prefer a \u201crenationalised\u201d continent knit together \u201cthrough a network of purpose-based, practical, and results-oriented bilateral and multilateral agreements\u201d, which sounds both utopian and even more Byzantine than the EU itself. More importantly, he simply wants much less regulation in general. He derides European environmental, food safety and privacy regulation as \u201cshams\u201d based on scare stories and anti-American protectionism. But in an age where corporations can exploit the gaps between nation states and globalising markets to evade tax, exploit workers and damage the environment, European citizens should realise national retrenchment and unfettered capitalism would be a toxic combination.\n\nGillingham too often sees integration and \u201cglobalisation\u201d as almost natural phenomena, the \u201cexogenous\u201d forces driving change in the world economy. They are not, however, inevitable processes, but reversible ones heavily influenced by institutions and their policies. It is wishful thinking to imagine that economic integration and political cooperation would continue smoothly after the demise of the EU. In the collective institutions\u2019 ruins there would be many populist incentives and opportunities for nationalist posturing, protectionism and conflict, especially in the poorer parts of the continent with young, fragile democracies. The future of Europe cannot be mortgaged to a libertarian fantasy.\n\nThere is no doubt that the EU\u2019s handling of the euro has, as Gillingham argues, discredited the idea of integration\n\nUnderlying all European economic questions is the ongoing saga of the euro. Many commentators would agree with Gillingham that monetary union has become the \u201cmaster\u201d of the EU, and that \u201cEurope is now run by a bank board\u201d (although Mario Draghi would say that if the Greeks and Germans now both dislike him he must be doing something right). It took the US well over a century to make its monetary union work, and Europe does not have that kind of time. We cannot, however, go back in time to undo European monetary union. Barry Eichengreen has argued that a eurozone breakup would precipitate \u201cthe mother of all financial crises\u201d. As Gillingham notes, a fiscal transfer union to strengthen it is a political non-starter, but was the euro the EU\u2019s \u201cpoint of no return\u201d? There are many reforms \u2013 banking union, debt restructuring, demand-side policies \u2013 that are possible. The single currency is not necessarily fatally flawed, and, even if it is, we must not, as Kevin O\u2019Rourke has written, allow the baby of European integration to be thrown out with the euro bathwater.\n\nThere is no doubt, however, that the EU\u2019s handling of the crisis and its \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d have, as Gillingham argues, discredited the idea of integration and stoked the fires of rightwing populism. The possible demise of free movement \u2013 Gillingham deems it a \u201cmajor achievement\u201d but sees the Schengen agreement as a \u201cdead letter\u201d \u2013 would be a body blow, cutting off the lifeblood of integration. Dismantling the flawed structure, however, would only encourage those negative forces, and tearing it down in favour of Gillingham\u2019s proposed \u201cmega markets\u201d of \u201cSchumpeterian creative destruction\u201d would be ideological folly, a vice from which Europe suffered enough in the last century.\n\nThose who believe in a cooperative and shared Europe cannot let the EU sink under the mistakes of arrogant and remote leaders. It is not beyond the wit of Europeans to build shared institutions that are democratic, fair and functional. Gillingham writes that there is more at stake in writing the EU\u2019s history than just \u201csetting the record straight\u201d, especially as the European project has too often been closed to \u201cheretics and doubters\u201d. He is right, which is why debates on its future must move beyond the binary biases of Eurosceptic and Europhile. The EU cannot go on as it is; but it must go on. Let us hope that reports of its death are exaggerated.\n\n\u2022 To order The EU for \u00a310.39 (RRP \u00a312.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Nigel Farage has encouraged Greeks to leave the union in order to \u201ctake back control and democracy\u201d, in a European project that \u201cis dying\u201d.\n\nIt is true that Greeks have become very Eurosceptic as a result of the EU\u2019s response to the country\u2019s crisis. Often, this has put them in awkward company. In 2015, the leader of the French far-right Front National, Marine Le Pen, was the first to congratulate the leftist Syriza for winning elections in Greece. Yet, Athens\u2019s relationship with the EU is more complex than some would like to believe.\n\nNo matter how frustrated the country may be with Brussels, a staggering 75% of Greeks are still in favour of being part of the EU. Unlike the UK, most Greeks are not frustrated with the EU in general but, rather, with the austerity measures that are seen as \u201cimposed\u201d by Brussels. Indeed, Syriza won on a platform of having a \u201cdifferent\u201d relationship with the EU, rather than no relation at all. To understand this \u201creluctant Euroscepticism\u201d is to understand Greece\u2019s historic ties with the EU.\n\nQ&A: What Syriza's victory means for Greece and the EU bailout Read more\n\nGreece\u2019s relationship with Brussels has always been linked to the country\u2019s democratic coming-of-age. Like its neighbours Spain and Portugal, one of the main reasons that Greece joined the EU in the 1980s was to consolidate its democratic transition from a seven-year long dictatorship. Thirty-five years after Greece\u2019s entry to the EU, little has changed. Greeks continue to view the union as a way to remain stable in what is often an insecure region, but also to bolster their strength in a globalised world and the challenges that come with that, such as migration.\n\nIn this way, Greece resembles the countries of central and eastern Europe, which joined the EU in order to become part of a club of peace and security. Most important, Greece reminds us of the very reason for the foundation of the union \u2013 then the European Economic Community \u2013 in the 1950s: to ensure security and stability through cooperation.\n\nOf course, the UK\u2019s story is a little different. It has been politically stable far longer than Greece. Nor did the UK experience the two world wars in the same way as many continental countries. This might, in part, explain why the UK was not one of the founding members of European cooperation \u2013 but it does not mean the security and opportunities that the EU offers should not be of equal importance to London.\n\nThere is no question that the EU\u2019s biggest achievement was the creation and expansion of a security zone, which was achieved through cooperation and interdependence. It has made a European war unthinkable and allowed states to pool their power, creating more opportunities and enabling them to better face the challenges ahead.\n\nThe kind of world we have today makes this cooperation all the more important. The problems that European states face simply cannot be resolved alone. More than ever, issues have become global rather than national.\n\nThis has not happened because of the EU, despite what many Eurosceptics may claim. Climate change was not brought about by the EU, and neither was international terrorism. It is the irreversible process of globalisation that makes these issues transnational, and regional cooperation is the most effective way of tackling them. This means that staying in the EU strengthens Greece\u2019s \u2013 and the UK\u2019s \u2013 sovereignty in many respects.\n\nOf course, leaving the EU does not prevent cooperation with the rest of the world \u2013 but it would make it harder to influence what the EU would look like and do. Take, for example, the argument that the UK should leave the EU because countries from the Balkans or Turkey are lining up to join. Brexit would not make these countries move from the map to a region that will be of no relevance. The UK will remain in Europe and with the same neighbours.\n\nThe only difference that Brexit would make is that it will be impossible for the UK to influence the very region it is part of \u2013 including a veto on which countries are admitted to the EU. Brexit would also mean abandoning a seat at the table of one of the main forums that shapes the world \u2013 be it on trade, environmental or other issues.\n\nOf course, the EU is not free of problems \u2013 which political project is? It is hard to deny that there is a significant gap between European citizens and the EU, which should be of concern. Yet, if history teaches us anything, it is that the EU has developed through crises. Take for example, how, after 9/11, states moved towards greater cooperation on issues of terrorism, including the introduction of the European arrest warrant, which was recently used to extradite the Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam to France and in the past has helped British authorities to extradite suspects to the UK.\n\nJean Monnet, the French diplomat and father of the EU, once said: \u201cEurope will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.\u201d Being a European country, no matter how small or large, choosing to stay outside is a grave mistake.

I think they will be 80-20 for that, without doubt,\u201d says Mackinlay, who expects Thanet to register just above a national turnout of 60%. Not all is harmonious, however, within the local out campaign, largely due to the toxic hangover from Farage\u2019s struggle with Mackinlay, who accuses Ukip of failing to \u201cput their backs\u201d into the campaign with him.\n\nIn addition to the leave camp\u2019s civil war, the major Tory splits produced by the referendum are also evident in the fact that Charlie Elphicke, Mackinlay\u2019s parliamentary colleague for Thanet\u2019s neighbouring constituency of Dover, is backing a vote to stay. It\u2019s one of the tougher positions for a Tory remain campaigner, given how large Dover looms as the frontline in the minds of those voters among Kent\u2019s larger 1.5 million population who are motivated by immigration concerns.\n\nThe port\u2019s own complicated relationship with Europe manifests in a myriad of ways these days.

We should never have joined in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the views of Selman and other Cornish people who share his opinions all the more extraordinary is that Cornwall has, on the face of it, benefited more from EU funding than any other English region.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People in Falmouth have been giving their thoughts ahead of the EU referendum.

Companies that specialise in marine energy, robotics and mining have also done well.\n\nEuroscepticism, however, is alive and kicking in Falmouth and across the far south-west. Five out of the six Cornwall MPs are in favour of leaving the EU, including the farming minister George Eustice. Two of the six south-west region MEPs are from Ukip and in the 2014 European elections, Nigel Farage\u2019s party polled three times more votes than the second-placed Lib Dems in Cornwall.

I bet if you went into one of those EU offices they wouldn\u2019t be able to find Cornwall on a map.\u201d\n\nKim Conchie, the Falmouth-based chief executive of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, said he believed there was an \u201canarchic, independent, contrary\u201d streak to many Cornish people that made them suspicious of the EU.\n\n\u201cI really fear for Cornwall if we leave,\u201d he said. \u201cThe EU money has created businesses, jobs, a better-educated workforce.\u201d He said he feared that if the leave vote prevailed, Westminster would ignore Cornwall. \u201cWe had Boris Johnson here saying \u2018we\u2019 guarantee that the same amount of money will be spent in Cornwall. Who\u2019s the \u2018we\u2019 in that? How can he give that guarantee?\u201d\n\nLike the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru in Wales, the Cornish nationalist party, Mebyon Kernow, is for remaining. It argues that the EU has a better record of providing funding for the region than Westminster.\n\nThe party\u2019s economy spokesperson, Andrew Long, said: \u201cThe London government has continually ignored Cornwall and its people. Funding for basic services and infrastructure has been well below the UK average and, as such, we are now rock bottom of the economic regions in terms of GDP and the fault lies squarely with Westminster.\u201d\n\nThe steering group of the campaign group Kernow Matters To Us, which has attracted headlines for taking on English Heritage over the \u201cDisneyfication\u201d of that most Cornish of landmarks, Tintagel Castle, is also worried about what will happen if Britain leaves the EU.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Farmers\u2019 market in Falmouth.

The wise amongst the population of Cornwall are keeping their own counsel on this matter. Many will trust Europe more than Westminster.\u201d\n\nThere is an immense feeling of disenfranchisement in Cornwall. It is a wonder if any of us care which way it goes Merv Davey, grand bard of Cornwall\n\nThe grand bard of Cornwall, \u201cDr Folk\u201d Merv Davey, said he was not so sure that most Cornish people really cared. \u201cTo be honest I think there is an immense feeling of disenfranchisement in Cornwall and it is a wonder if any of us care which way it goes,\u201d he said.\n\nThey certainly care up at the Penryn campus, a base for both Falmouth and Exeter universities, developed with EU funding. Falmouth University\u2019s vice-chancellor, Anne Carlisle, argued that because Cornwall was on the \u201cedge\u201d geographically, it was important it was also part of something bigger such as the EU.\n\nTom Brown, the director of the video games startup Burning Arrow, based at the academy for innovation and research within the university, employs a Bulgarian contractor and works with a German publisher. \u201cFor my business it\u2019s important we stay in the EU,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the farmers\u2019 market in Falmouth, Nigel Ekins, of The Cornish Smokehouse, purveyors of smoked fish and cheese, said he believed scepticism over the EU could be the result of the Cornish being insular, worried about anything that changed their way of living, and of bringing in new people. \u201cPeople talk about loss of sovereignty. I think it is xenophobia. They fear outsiders. But in the last 30 years Cornwall has changed enormously. Back then the sight of a new car would be the talk of the town. It looks prosperous now,\u201d he said.\n\nJennie Keeler was selling asparagus at the market. She and her husband, John, grow the spring vegetable on their farm near Truro. \u201cI\u2019m wavering. I swing from one day to another,\u201d she said. \u201cI like Boris Johnson but I wonder why he is so against Europe. Is he doing it because he wants to be prime minister?\u201d For the first time this season, Keeler is finding her produce up against imports from Poland. \u201cThat makes you think.\u201d\n\nOver at the Cornish Store, Anne and Keven Ayres\u2019s stock includes novelty \u201cCornish border patrol\u201d T-shirts, but they believe Cornwall is better off in the EU. \u201cWe like the idea of Europe being a place our children and grandchildren can visit and work in freely,\u201d said Anne.\n\nTheir Poldark merchandise \u2013 cards, tea towels, cushions \u2013 is the bestselling at the moment.

First, a moment of recognition \u2013 and ignition \u2013 is required. Someone must dare to make the initial leap, to retrieve the frozen thesis from its glacial prison.\n\nIn the case of Brexit, it was Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, who dragged the idea back from the snowy wastes. Since the 1975 referendum on Common Market membership \u2013 in which British voters opted to stay in by 67% to 33% \u2013 the notion that Britain might be better off outside the European Community had lost traction, apart from on the political fringes. Yes, withdrawal remained official Labour policy for much of the 1980s; but this was one of many reasons why the party was still unelectable.\n\nSo Lamont\u2019s decision to grant the idea mainstream credibility was a significant moment \u2013 more so even than it seemed at the time. Most of the memoirs and histories cite his speech at a fringe meeting at the 1994 Conservative conference in Bournemouth, in which he railed against the tide of EU integration: \u201cOne day it may mean contemplating withdrawal. It has recently been said that the option of leaving the Community was \u2018unthinkable\u2019. I believe this attitude is rather simplistic.\u201d\n\nFor a senior politician, recently sacked as chancellor, to make such a statement was an occasion of high drama. But it was not the first time that Lamont had road-tested the idea. I was present earlier that year at a private meeting of the Conservative Philosophy Group, at which Lamont had urged his audience \u2013 fellow politicians, academics, journalists \u2013 to bring Brexit (as it was not yet known) down from the naughty step of political discourse and restore it to the range of serious possibilities available to governments.\n\nThe meetings of the group, in Jonathan Aitken\u2019s house in Lord North Street in Westminster, were invariably interesting: a reflection of the shared belief that Conservatism amounted to more than the electoral face of self-interest and that Conservative ideas, seriously under-represented in British universities, drew upon a rich and vibrant intellectual tradition. (I remember Sir James Goldsmith, the billionaire founder of the Referendum party, bringing along his young son Zac to hear the debates.) But the night of Lamont\u2019s speech \u2013 the gist of which had been leaked to the media \u2013 was the only gathering that attracted television crews and photographers, who waited on the pavement for reaction. The atmosphere within crackled with excitement, Lamont\u2019s features twitching like a mischievous badger.\n\nThis was the twilight of the John Major era, the long goodbye to a generation of Tory government. Then, as now, Europe was dividing the Conservative party and a terrible reckoning lay ahead in the 1997 election. In practice, Black Wednesday in 1992 (the day when the pound fell out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism) and the election of Tony Blair to the Labour leadership in 1994 had already done for the Tories. But they still had little collective sense of the electoral calamity in store.\n\nBy the time his party returned to office in 2010, Lamont\u2019s former special adviser David Cameron had been its leader for more than four years. In the interests of electability, he had urged his fellow Conservatives to stop \u201cbanging on\u201d about Europe \u2013 a plea that they had respected, up to a point. But only up to a point. Thanks originally to Lamont \u2013 Cameron\u2019s former mentor \u2013 the possibility that Britain might leave the EU was now emphatically back in play. It was only a matter of time before it would rock his government to its very foundations.\n\nIt has taken 22 years for this simple idea \u2013 that we should withdraw from the EU \u2013 to grow to its present scale: we are eight days from a vote that could make real what Lamont made thinkable. The leave campaign has focused to a depressing extent upon immigration. But the case for departure has deeper intellectual roots that cannot be dismissed as mere nostalgia, xenophobia or reactionary reflex.\n\nThe idea of Brexit has become part of the warp and weft of contemporary politics. The question, surprisingly unexplored, is: how?\n\nLong before it was so, Tony Blair believed that the true intention of the Tory Eurosceptics, whatever they claimed to the contrary, was always to get out of Europe. Though most of them insisted that their ambitions were confined to \u201crenegotiation\u201d of Britain\u2019s membership terms or the partial \u201crepatriation\u201d of UK sovereignty, Blair was sure that this was a ruse: the Tories\u2019 true objective was to liberate the nation from the EU\u2019s clammy grip.\n\nWhen Blair took office in 1997, this was definitely not yet the case. His own enthusiasm for the EU, and impatience with whatever \u201cforces of conservatism\u201d stood in his way, clouded his judgment. In practice, his management of the \u201cEuropean question\u201d was a petri dish that created the environment for hostility to the EU to flourish among Tories. By the time he left office in 2007, a great many Conservatives had concluded that the European project was irredeemable and that exit was the only sensible option.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont arriving at the Treasury on Black Wednesday. Photograph: Adam Butler/PA Archive/PA Photos\n\nIt is easy to forget that Blair\u2019s unambiguous intention when he became prime minister was to take Britain into the very heart of the EU, not least by joining the single currency. In 2002, he told the Labour conference: \u201cThe euro is not just about our economy, but our destiny.\u201d\n\nGordon Brown, of course, did not share this dream, and successfully thwarted Blair\u2019s ambition to take Britain into the single currency. Where Blair saw poetry in the European project, Brown saw only prose. But, for a decade, the occupant of No 10 was a fervently committed EU-phile. This was bound to have dramatic consequences for the politics of the opposition and the emerging shape of conservatism in the early 21st century. The more passionate he became about Britain\u2019s role in the EU, the more convinced Eurosceptics became that the process of integration was spinning out of control and must be halted \u2013 by exit, if necessary.\n\nA cohort of young Conservatives began to argue, with an intellectual coherence that could not be ignored, that Britain would be better off outside the EU. The two most prominent representatives of this tendency within the Tory movement were Daniel Hannan, an MEP since 1999, and Douglas Carswell, who has been an MP for Harwich and then Clacton since 2005. Carswell became Ukip\u2019s first member of parliament in 2014, after his defection from the Conservatives forced a byelection in his constituency.\n\nRather than objecting to the EU on reactionary grounds, Hannan and Carswell argued that it was not modern enough. In the 21st century, as technology tranformed the way we live, they asserted that voters would demand devolution and decentralisation, accountability and transparency. Against this political and cultural backdrop, the EU was hopelessly out of date.\n\nThis was the beginning of the Vote Leave movement (both Hannan and Carswell now sit on its campaign committee). What is under-appreciated is the extent to which it was a response to the Blair years, an intellectual counter-revolution.\n\nMuch of its energy was generated by Blair\u2019s conspicuous refusal to consult the electorate on the ratification of EU agreements. The treaties of Amsterdam (1997) and of Nice (2001) were significant steps along the integrationist path, but did not trigger plebiscites in this country. By the time the EU constitutional treaty was signed in Rome in 2004, the pressure for a referendum was immense \u2013 and not confined to the Tory benches. Here, after all, was an international pact that dramatically changed the rules on qualified majority voting (as opposed to the system where a single nation could veto a proposal), gave legal force to the EU\u2019s charter of fundamental rights and extended the EU\u2019s power into areas such as energy and space policy.\n\nAt first, Blair resisted the idea of a referendum, but in April 2004, he dramatically changed his mind. \u201cIt is time to decide whether our destiny lies as a leading partner and ally in Europe or on its margins,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the issue be put and let the battle be joined.\u201d Blair believed that he could take on the Eurosceptics and secure Britain\u2019s position in Europe once and for all. Alas for him, the plan was scuppered by referendums in France and the Netherlands, both of which rejected the treaty and sent the EU\u2019s draftsmen scurrying back to their drawing boards.\n\nBy the end of his premiership, Blair, one of his closest allies told me at the time, felt a true \u201csense of loss\u201d over Europe, close to a bereavement. I recall attending a speech he gave at St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford, in 2006 as part of his unofficial extended farewell tour. By now, there was no talk of \u201cdestiny\u201d; only an admission that the political class had \u201clocked [itself] in a room at the top of the tower\u201d, fretting over rules when it should have been busily winning hearts and minds.\n\nThat speech, a decade ago, was an elegy to a dream. It was part-cheerful, part-rueful, Blair\u2019s way of saying adieu to his European vision. What he did not sense was that the subterranean forces unleashed during his long premiership would coalesce in the next decade and bring Britain to the brink of leaving the EU.\n\nEach of the parliamentary Brexiteers has his or her own story. Sometimes, it involves a slow, incremental disenchantment. In other cases, the moment of rejection was clear and identifiable. In spite of his long association with the case for withdrawal, Douglas Carswell falls into the latter category.\n\n\u201cI remember quite vividly,\u201d he told me earlier this year. \u201cFor me it was the failure of Blair. I was at the time working for a pan-European fund-management group. Everyone around me said that the euro was a good thing, the Lisbon agenda [devised in 2000 for economic reform of the EU] looked like it was really going to finally change Europe, and make it flexible. They talked about it being the most dynamic part of the world economy by 2010. Blair had so much political capital, not just domestically but internationally.\u201d His inability to translate that cachet into hard reform tipped Carswell into a firm commitment to Brexit.\n\nTheresa Villiers, the Northern Ireland secretary, described a more gradual process of disillusionment. \u201cWhen I was selected as a candidate for European elections back in 1998, I was certainly sceptical about the European project. But at that stage I wouldn\u2019t have thought seriously about leaving the EU \u2013 it just didn\u2019t seem to be on the agenda. My thinking was: we just have to make the situation work, get the reforms we need, and try to push the EU in the direction which focused on trade and business, and away from grand political projects.\u201d\n\nExperience of the European parliament and commission gradually convinced Villiers that the EU\u2019s institutions and culture were beyond repair. \u201cWhatever the question, whatever the problem, whatever the crisis, the answer was more Europe, more EU, more political integration,\u201d she recalled. \u201cFor decades we\u2019ve had people in the Foreign Office saying Europe is coming our way, we\u2019ve changed its direction, we\u2019ve got opt-outs. And it just became abundantly clear to me that we were never going to win that argument in Europe.\u201d\n\nSlowly, steadily \u2013 mostly as individuals rather than as groups or factions \u2013 Tory MPs were drawing the same conclusions, deciding that the EU was beyond redemption. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, and Michael Heseltine, remained stubborn evangelists for the EU ideal. But they had not persuaded a younger phalanx of Tories to follow their path. Conservative opinion reflected a spectrum of opinion from diffident Euroscepticism to full-throated champions of Brexit.\n\nWhen he became Tory leader in December 2005, David Cameron perceived the issue as entirely managerial. The eurozone crisis had ended any prospect of Britain joining the single currency, so it was not hard for him to assert that sterling was safe as long as he was in charge.\n\nAmong senior Tories the overriding fear, however, was more prosaic: namely that the next Conservative prime minister would face the same problems as John Major, beholden in the Commons to a group of hardline Eurosceptics who exploited the parliamentary arithmetic to push the prime minister further than he wanted to go on European matters or in other areas of policy. Daniel Finkelstein \u2013 then an adviser to William Hague, now a Times columnist and life peer \u2013 used to joke that the Tory Eurosceptics \u201cwouldn\u2019t take \u2018Yes\u2019 for an answer.\u201d\n\nCameron certainly didn\u2019t want his premiership to be hobbled in that way. He also didn\u2019t want to entrench voters\u2019 fears that Tories were idiosyncratic, sectarian, and fixated by oddball priorities rather than those of the electorate. When Cameron told his party to stop \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d in 2006, he was issuing a warning about discipline and collective priority rather than unveiling a policy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Douglas Carswell, the UKip MP for Clacton and leading Brexit campaigner. Photograph: Richard Saker/The Observer\n\nIn this respect, the hung parliament delivered by the 2010 general election spared him the fate that Major had suffered. As a governing partnership with the Liberal Democrats became a realistic prospect, Cameron was heard to remark that coalition with Nick Clegg was probably preferable to being in \u201ccoalition with Bill Cash\u201d, the passionately sceptical MP for Stone, Staffordshire, and chair of the Commons European scrutiny committee.\n\nAs the Cameron-Clegg government found its bearings, the number of Brexiteers on the Tory benches was not immediately apparent. The new PM had already kept his promise to withdraw his party from the centre-right grouping in the European parliament, the European People\u2019s party. In June 2009, Hague, back in the frontline as one of Cameron\u2019s closest lieutenants, had announced the formation of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), an explicitly \u201canti-federalist\u201d bloc initially composed of 55 MEPs.\n\nNaturally, this was welcomed by sceptical Tories. But it did not really compensate for a much greater grievance \u2013 specifically, the failure to hold a referendum on the treaty of Lisbon. This pact, signed in 2007, was essentially a reheated version of the constitutional treaty, presented with less pageantry and pomp. You did not have to be a Euro-anorak to spot that any country that had promised a referendum on the constitutional treaty should offer one now. Yet, as prime minister, Gordon Brown decided not to make such an offer.\n\nIn September 2007, Cameron had written an article for the Sun, offering the punters \u201cthis cast-iron guarantee: if I become PM a Conservative government will hold a referendum on any EU treaty that emerges from these negotiations.\u201d\n\nIn November 2009, it became clear that the treaty of Lisbon was going to be ratified by all 27 member states, entering EU law, and Cameron concluded that his pledge was no longer binding. For a while, Hague had offered a new promise \u2013 still opaque \u2013 that he and Cameron would not \u201clet matters rest there\u201d if the treaty was thus ratified.\n\nThe strategy was both ambitious and perilous. First, there would be a referendum lock on significant transfers of sovereignty to Brussels in the future \u2013 an objective achieved in the European Union Act 2011. Second, there would be an audit of the balance of power between Britain and the EU. Third, on the basis of that audit, the prime minister would renegotiate Britain\u2019s terms of membership. And, fourth, there would be an in-out referendum on the deal he had struck in Brussels.\n\nImmense thought and energy were expended upon this plan, which was announced in its entirety in January 2013 at Bloomberg\u2019s London HQ. As the leave cause has improved its position in the polls, I have been struck by the number of people who now claim \u2013 or let it be known that they claim \u2013 that they tried to talk the prime minister out of embarking upon this rocky and potentially self-destructive path.\n\nAs so often, George Osborne was the person in the room who articulated the truth, palatable or not. \u201cThe referendum genie is out of the bottle,\u201d he said in private around the time of the Bloomberg speech. What he meant was that the cycle of agitation for such a vote, followed by the government of the day\u2019s refusal to oblige, could not go on indefinitely.\n\nNor could Cameron afford to be seen as untrustworthy \u2013 by the voters, or by his backbenchers, many of whom were antagonistic towards the coalition. The unapologetic Europhilia of Nick Clegg nurtured the Euroscepticism of the average Tory MP. So what if Lisbon was already written into EU law? Couldn\u2019t its content be removed if the British people were given their say and rejected the treaty? And why was Clegg allowed a nationwide referendum in 2011 on the marginal issue of the alternative vote, while Tories were denied a vote on a sweeping EU deal?\n\nIf the Blair years had spawned an intellectual counter-revolution, the coalition helped it spread. In October 2011, a motion submitted by David Nuttall, the Tory MP for Bury North, came before the Commons, thanks to a new system that granted parliamentary time to online petitions that had secured more than 100,000 signatures and then been chosen by the backbench business committee. The Nuttall motion called for a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU.\n\nWhat followed was a hint of the disciplinary breakdown that has engulfed the Conservative party at every level during the current campaign. The motion was not binding and might have been an opportunity to allow backbenchers, frustrated by the constraints of coalition, to let off steam in a free vote. Instead, Cameron imposed a three-line whip. The mayhem that followed did the prime minister and his EU strategy no favours at all, and revealed that, where Europe was concerned, MPs\u2019 loyalties were very unclear.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Leading Brexiteers Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa Villiers. Photograph: Reuters\n\nIt was at this point, for instance, that George Eustice, formerly Cameron\u2019s press secretary, emerged as leader of the Fresh Start group of Eurosceptic MPs. These Tories were mostly young and, in almost every respect, faithful to Cameron\u2019s cause. But they took a different view of the EU and Britain\u2019s role in it. Behind the scenes, Steve Hilton, one of Cameron\u2019s closest advisers and friends, had concluded that Britain needed to get out of the EU as soon as possible, lest our spirit of enterprise and creativity be strangled by red tape.\n\nAt this stage, Cameron remained confident that his renegotiation of Britain\u2019s membership would bring around such allies. In this respect, he gravely underestimated the commitment to Brexit that was spreading in his tribe. On the lookout for political mischief, Cameron was paying insufficient attention to the genuine dilemmas facing those who wanted to be loyal to him.\n\nThe intellectual ancestry of leave has much more intellectually coherent roots than Farage\u2019s pound-shop Anglo-Trumpery\n\nIn recent months, we have grown used to speculation about what will happen to Cameron if he loses. A favourite parlour game in the Westminster village right now is to name Boris Johnson\u2019s first cabinet, and to ponder which role Michael Gove might occupy. But the experience of those Brexiteer Tories who have no ulterior political motive, such as Villiers and Hilton, is more compelling than of those who are using the campaign as a lever to displace Cameron. Villiers manifestly abhors the reduction of government to light entertainment and hates opposing her boss. Yet she and thousands of Tories like her believe that they cannot support their prime minister when he needs them most.\n\nIn a party that still notionally venerates loyalty and takes seriously the claim of the incumbent leader to his or her party\u2019s support, the pursuit of an outcome that may destroy a premiership is a huge deal. How have they reached this point?\n\nIf leave wins on 23 June, it will be a victory for Nigel Farage. As the referendum has approached, the closing argument of the Brexiteers has been shockingly focused upon the supposed ill effects of immigration, and the misleading argument that leaving the EU will resolve those problems at a stroke. That is the high-carb political junk food on which the leavers have been feeding the nation. It is the old Ukip trick \u2013 xenophobia disguised as constitutionalism \u2013 and at the time of writing, it is gaining ground.\n\nYet the intellectual ancestry of the leave cause has much more interesting and coherent roots than Farage\u2019s pound-shop Anglo-Trumpery. The argument of the more thoughtful Brexiteers is that postwar, post-Thatcher Britain has reached a point of economic strength, cultural maturity and confidence that enables it to be weaned from the unreformable EU.\n\n\u201cWe are very keen to put a positive case,\u201d Villiers told me. \u201cIn many ways joining the EU in the 70s was an admission of defeat based on the assumption that we were destined in this country for perennial decline. Now you look at our economic performance compared to Europe and we are performing much better than the bulk of eurozone countries.\u201d\n\nCarswell goes further: \u201cI\u2019d say Euroscepticism is a product of modernity. It\u2019s a rational response to a changing world and it\u2019s born of hope that actually things can be better. So if the vote goes leave\u2019s way on the 23rd we\u2019ll look back on the period between 1973 [the year the UK joined the EU] and 2016 as a sort of exceptional period.\u201d\n\nThe irrepressibly optimistic MP for Clacton sees the yearning to leave the EU not as a foetal cringe by old-fashioned voters but precisely the opposite. \u201cIt is absolutely not English exceptionalism, this is not John Bull nationalism. On the contrary, I would say that modernity makes those ideas look more ridiculous than ever \u2026 The European project is based on the idea, \u2018Restrict your freedoms and your liberties and your sovereignties and leave it to us, we\u2019ll manage.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhy has the idea of Brexit suddenly gathered pace? Farage would probably attribute the success of his party and its central argument to \u201cmass immigration\u201d, as if the EU were the sole agency that determines this most complex of policy questions. Carswell \u2013 notionally in the same party as Farage, though you would never know it \u2013 suggests that a convergence of forces has suddenly conspired to make leaving the EU seem, to many, like the best course of action.\n\nThis is how radical change happens, according to Carswell. \u201cI remember working on an archaeological dig in Europe in the late 80s, and a German woman my age telling me that East Germany would never be free. Within five years, it was. I remember growing up in Uganda [where his parents were doctors] and people telling me that apartheid would take at least 30 years to crumble \u2013 it was gone within a decade. When something very significant happens \u2013 which Brexit will be \u2013 the forces animating change conspire very fast.\u201d\n\nAs he makes his case that Britain could do better if it were free, the unexpected exhibit is the 2012 Olympic Games. \u201cI was slightly curmudgeonly [at the start],\u201d he told me. \u201cI\u2019d just been elected as an MP when we put in the bid for the Olympic Games and like lots of people I thought, \u2018Oh gosh, it\u2019s going to make London crowded and it\u2019s a lot of money\u2019. And then it started and I thought, how wrong I was \u2013 wow, we can celebrate what a great country we are. It really lifted and I think that\u2019s the atmosphere and the vibe that will come out of 23 June.\u201d\n\nFor those engaged in the struggle to free Britain from the EU, this is more than another campaign. If they lose on 23 June, the battle will go on, in guerrilla form and in referendums on specific EU treaties.\n\nWhen I visited Matthew Elliott, the CEO of Vote Leave, he was planning Take Control Day for 12 March. There was a time when Eurosceptics agonised about \u201csovereignty\u201d, sounding like the jurists and lawyers that many of them were. Their objective was the \u201crepatriation of powers\u201d \u2013 a menacing phrase that meant little to voters. The new generation of Brexiteers has settled upon the friendlier notion of \u201ccontrol\u201d \u2013 a word that deftly links the geopolitical with the personal.\n\nAs much as anyone, Elliott, who is 38, has been the figure giving the case for departure organisational and intellectual coherence. His partner in crime is the brilliantly contentious Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove. Elliott\u2019s job has been to maintain discipline on the leave side, and to ensure that the campaign nurtures optimism, not anxiety \u2013 though the politicians fighting the battle on the frontline have not always obeyed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matthew Elliott, the head of Vote Leave Photograph: Peter Nicholls / Reuters/Reuters\n\nThe HQ of Vote Leave, where, at this point, 35 of its 55 staff were based, is in a modern building on Albert Embankment. Bespectacled, rangy and calm, Elliott comes across as the very opposite of a flame-eyed ideologue \u2013 more as a prosperous investment banker who has not let his mews house in Chelsea go to his head. In fact, he is one of the most experienced \u2013 and successful \u2013 single-issue campaigners in the UK. It was largely Elliott\u2019s strategising that secured such a decisive victory for the campaign to reject the adoption of the alternative vote system in 2011 \u2013 only the second nationwide referendum to be held in the UK. His specific insight was to grasp early in that campaign that Labour voters would decide the result, which proved to be the case, Since then, he has been intermittently preparing for the third such plebiscite.\n\nThe establishment of the group Business for Britain \u2013 a coalition of sceptic businessmen founded in April 2013 \u2013 reflected an early recognition by the Brexiteers that they had to be in a position to deny from the start remain\u2019s inevitable claim that business was foursquare behind continued membership of the EU. Without Business for Britain, said Elliott, \u201cwe\u2019d be in a situation where people would still be saying that business is basically united behind remain and we\u2019d [only] be able to get out a few business folk. The media story would be \u2018Businesses for remain.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was equally important that the leave campaign not resemble a committee of the fringe. Its claims needed to sound like common sense, not the fist-waving slogans of peripheral ideologues. In 1975, the out campaign attracted figures who were regarded as extreme: Enoch Powell, Tony Benn, the leaders of the National Front. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to set up a platform which has attracted some serious people,\u201d said Elliott. \u201cHad it not been for Michael [Gove] and Boris [Johnson] you might have expected, for argument\u2019s sake, 50 to 70 Tory MPs to be on the leave side.\u201d According to the BBC website, at the time of writing 150 MPs had declared in favour of the leave campaign.\n\nBrexit will hurt your city, Labour tells core voters \u2013 but no one's listening Read more\n\nTo stand a chance of winning, Vote Leave has had to transform \u2013 or at least try to transform \u2013 the way in which Brexiteers are perceived by the public. The campaign cannot look like a heritage organisation, preserving an endangered version of Britain from extinction or vandalism. It must reverse the usual polarities of this debate, making the remain camp look old-fashioned and sentimentally attached to an idea of Britain\u2019s place in the world that is hopelessly out of date and quite unsuited to the 21st century.\n\nLike Carswell, Elliott believes that Britain\u2019s role in the EU could have been salvaged had Brussels itself recognised how it is being changed by the headwinds of history. \u201cI think naturally the EU is breaking up into being the more centralised eurozone versus the non-eurozone member states. So to have non-eurozone member states with a looser trade-based relationship was feasible \u2013 and is actually where I think the EU is generally going.\u201d But instead of pushing for a genuinely two-tier Europe, says Elliott, Cameron accepted crumbs from the Brussels table and called it a \u201cspecial status\u201d. This transaction dramatised the leave message at the perfect moment, argues Elliott. It made the voters wonder what they were getting for their \u00a3350m a week (or \u00a3136m as the Guardian\u2019s referendum reality check calculated).\n\nWhy Vote Leave's \u00a3350m weekly EU cost claim is wrong Read more\n\nIt is striking that Elliott does not deploy the familiar argument that we were duped or misled in 1975. His argument is more sophisticated, and concedes something to the other side. Back in the 1970s, when Britain was weakened by industrial decline, inflation and union strife, it needed the protection of the EEC and membership of the club. According to this view, the electorate was right to vote for \u201cin\u201d, and decisively so. But, 41 years later, different conditions prevail, and Britain no longer requires the crutch of this costly alliance. If there is such as thing as the spirit of the age, it is at odds with the idea that unelected bureaucrats in Brussels and judges in Luxembourg have aggregated so much power over our lives. The EU was founded in an age when the idea of taking power from elected demagogues and fiery orators and giving it to dull bureaucrats had much obvious appeal. But now, in 2016, the children and grandchildren of the generation that fought in the second world war expect accountability, transparency and the ability to sack those in government who let them down.\n\nOn the day that I saw Elliott, the papers were full of allegations \u2013 later convincingly denied \u2013 that Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, has been denying key papers to senior ministers who support Brexit. Elliott was in no doubt: \u201cIf this turns into a referendum between the establishment and the people, we will win. By miles.\u201d\n\nIn the history of ideas, context is all. In the last days of this contest, the leave campaign is concentrating remorselessly upon immigration \u2013 its prime doorstep issue. But there is a broader setting, too: the embrace of Brexit by a significant tranche of the political class reflects despair with the EU, matched, more interestingly, by a faith in Britain\u2019s ability to go it alone and a conviction that the 21st century will favour nimble states over cumbersome bureaucratic blocs.\n\nThose who seek such a role for this country no longer define Britain\u2019s place in the world by its presence at all its top tables, from the UN security council to the G8 to the EU itself. They envisage the millennial UK as something closer to a buccaneering galleon, unrestrained and versatile. Whatever else may be said about this declaration of independence, it has little in common with the calls for parliamentary sovereignty to be restored that defined the case for withdrawal in 1975. Even if leave loses on 23 June, the aspiration it reflects will survive, and live to fight another day.\n\nEven in his most grandiose moments, I doubt that Norman Lamont can ever have imagined that the idea he pulled out of the deep freeze would flourish as it has. In his memoirs, the former chancellor recalls how he was shunned at the 1994 conference after his speech questioning Britain\u2019s membership of the EU \u2013 and by whom. \u201cThe next person I saw,\u201d he writes, \u201cwas David Cameron, my former special adviser at the Treasury, who cut me dead.\u201d\n\nRevenge takes many forms.\n\n\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7945ed914258eaf1714d79fac653c417d49c6fc5/934_0_4066_3000/master/4066.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=00885445124d85b43211b99a04bf3666", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9d27e6daa2d7668988d0a6b49920729031a4a01/0_145_1326_1859/master/1326.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ba56d95ee9b854194722bd503305268d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cf3856cfa5640a77f4620d6bf8446edc6c213ac/0_218_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=61bf0dcec94e13e0cf700e8a12dbb9cb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37c6c9480e11b842a458928080ce24a7ace4f830/0_173_3582_2150/master/3582.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4198e1110340ddf25714c1dea1e7a060", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8daf7035477f831758a5c5be9d693a063b139fa/0_24_3963_2624/master/3963.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3d982bb4899130da6a7511818afb5b01", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CConservatives", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7945ed914258eaf1714d79fac653c417d49c6fc5/1415_424_3585_2151/3585.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a95d591032d6dde8b71b59fd8069b250", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7945ed914258eaf1714d79fac653c417d49c6fc5/1415_424_3585_2151/3585.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a95d591032d6dde8b71b59fd8069b250", "date": "15/06/2016"}, "rank_15": {"title": "Europhobia: a very British problem | Geoffrey Wheatcroft", "text": "\u2018I could not consent to the introduction into our national life of a device so alien to all our traditions as the referendum,\u201d Clement Attlee said, \u201cwhich has only too often been the instrument of Nazism and fascism.\u201d In the spring of 1945 Winston Churchill was still prime minister, leading the wartime coalition, and Attlee, the Labour leader, was his deputy. A general election was overdue, after the parliament, elected 10 years earlier, had artificially prolonged its own life. Now Churchill suggested prolonging it still further, and putting this proposal to the electorate in a then-unheard-of referendum. That brisk rebuff from Attlee settled the matter. In the summer, parliament was dissolved, a general election was held, Labour won in a landslide, and Attlee replaced Churchill at No 10. But his words were not forgotten.\n\nA generation later, the question of a referendum came up again, this time on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of what was then the European Economic Community. \u201cThe late Lord Attlee was right when he said that the referendum was a device of dictators and demagogues,\u201d said Margaret Thatcher at that time. She could remember the 1930s, when Hitler had held no fewer than four referendums to consolidate his regime, something that explains the aversion to referendums in the present-day German republic.\n\nBy now, David Cameron must be kicking himself for not thinking of Attlee\u2019s reply before he gave his panicky promise to hold a referendum on the EU. It was an epic miscalculation. In 1974, when Harold Wilson returned to office as prime minister of a Labour government, he agreed to hold a referendum the next year on continued membership, as a way of smoothing over the divisions inside his party. He got his wish when a large majority of the British electorate voted to stay.\n\nNo doubt, Cameron thought that he would repeat that trick, and heal the wounds of his own party. Instead, he set off a bitter feud within its ranks. But there was more to his mistake than merely failing to foresee that the Brexit wing of the Tories would comprise nearly half his MPs, and a noisy faction of his cabinet, or the degree to which the latest tragic migrant crisis would highlight existing fears about immigration. Cameron unleashed forces of which he had not been properly aware.\n\nEurophobia: a very British problem Read more\n\nSomething far deeper is at stake in this week\u2019s vote. A wave of resentment against the elites is sweeping Europe, and in Britain this summer, as John Harris has written, we have seen a working-class revolt. The referendum is a form of displacement activity. It\u2019s about something other \u2013 or much more \u2013 than what it is supposed to be about.\n\nThose forces, for which Euroscepticism is a wholly inadequate word, range from crude racism and nativist dislike of immigrants, to humble patriotism and yearning for a maybe imaginary lost age. The referendum turns not so much on the national interest as on a national idea.\n\nAs Robert Tombs, the Cambridge historian and author of The English and Their History, recently put it: \u201cThe campaign seems hardly about Europe at all, but it\u2019s all about us and the English identity.\u201d Both of the first two British attempts to join the Common Market were vetoed by Charles de Gaulle, and it was he who also said that all his life he had been inspired by \u201cune certaine id\u00e9e de la France\u201d. Behind our present turmoil lurks a certain idea of Britain, or of England. We are trying to find our identity.\n\nWhen did it begin, this idea of England, and our \u201cEuropean problem\u201d along with it? The Czech-born American scholar Karl Deutsch sourly defined a nation as \u201ca group of people united by a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbours\u201d. That has been more true of Anglo-British nationalism than we like to think: it is as much a patchwork of animosity, embroidered history and invented tradition as any other.\n\nGo back into the mists of time to search for what actually happened \u2013 and then for how that was turned into national legend. Caesar\u2019s invasion of Britain in 55BC would long afterwards lead to the patriotic cult of Queen Boudicca and her heroic rebellion against the Romans. The next conquest by William in 1066 crushed Anglo-Saxon England, but that in turn would produce the idea of \u201cthe Norman yoke\u201d, which had supposedly subjugated the English people. From the 17th century on, patriotic historians claimed that despite this Norman oppression, old English law and custom had survived.\n\nConservative party turmoil escalates with open call for Cameron to quit Read more\n\nAll this helped to create a myth of English uniqueness, not to say of unique English virtue. Yet the fact is that for thousands of years, not only have the British Isles been intimately bound together (Celtic nationalists please note), they have been intimately bound with Europe (English Europhobes please note), and peopled by endless migrations. England takes its name from the Angles, an invading German tribe along with Saxons and Jutes in the fifth century (this continual to and fro between the islands saw Scotland take its own name from the Scotti, an Irish tribe).\n\nFor most of the past thousand years, England has been ruled by foreign dynasties \u2013 including the present dynasty, which began with the arrival from Germany of the Elector of Hanover, who became George I in 1714. That was vividly reflected in continual commercial and cultural intercourse between Great Britain and the continent. The composer who wrote our finest coronation anthems and our favourite oratorio, was Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel from Halle near Leipzig. In some ways we were more \u201cEuropean\u201d in Victorian times than we are now. Simon Rattle may have conducted the Berlin Philharmonic for years, but can one imagine a famous German composer of our day \u2013 say Wolfgang Rihm \u2013 as a revered guest of the royal family, as Felix Mendelssohn was of Victoria and Albert?\n\n\u201cEuroscepticism\u201d has its own long history. Six centuries ago, England was viewed by Europe as a not very important satellite of the Holy Roman empire (and Scotland as an even less important satellite of France). That was before the Reformation and the beginning of what would become the greatest seaborne empire ever known, engaged from the start, in pillage, piracy and slavery dressed up in patriotic colours.\n\nArrogant Protestant Englishry found new vigour in the reign of Elizabeth I, its triumphalism expressed in everything from the defeat of the Spanish Armada to hanging and drawing Catholic priests as traitors at Tyburn, to trampling the Irish. And as it happened, the greatest writer in our language was on hand to give voice to this new mood: \u201cThis happy breed of men, this little world / This precious stone set in the silver sea \u2026 Against the envy of less happy lands, / This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Campaigners for withdrawal from the Common Market in 1975. Britain voted to stay in by a large majority. Photograph: Rolls Press/Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images\n\nThat all-too-familiar patriotic ode that Shakespeare put into John of Gaunt\u2019s mouth in Richard II was glorious bluster \u2013 and Shakespeare\u2019s history plays are the most brilliant agitprop ever written, not to a say fine case of what Giovanni Giolitti, the Italian prime minister early last century, tellingly called \u201cbeautiful national legends\u201d.\n\nHowever much this may have been invented tradition, it set the national tone for centuries of war and conquest, often dressed up in benevolent guise. In the 18th century, \u201cthis England\u201d became \u201crule Britannia\u201d, a process brilliantly described by the historian Linda Colley in her book Britons. This new British identity, which embraced the English, the Scots, the Welsh and the Ulster Protestants (though not of course the Catholic Irish), was forged by war, empire and Protestantism.\n\nToday, since the empire has gone, we no longer fight great wars, and we have ceased to be a Protestant country, one might expect the Britons described by Colley and their Britishness to have dwindled away. To some extent this has happened, as the political fracturing of the United Kingdom demonstrates. But Deutsch\u2019s two conditions for constructing the idea of nationhood were amply fulfilled in the 20th century, when two great wars gave the British fresh opportunity to hate their neighbours and to misunderstand their own history.\n\nIn a speech at the University of Zurich in 1946, Churchill admirably said: \u201cThere can be no revival of Europe without a spiritually great France and a spiritually great Germany.\u201d And yet coarse Germanophobia could still be found, from Lord Beaverbrook\u2019s newspapers, notably the Sunday Express, to AJP Taylor\u2019s history books. (Churchill himself also said privately that he wanted to see Germany \u201cfat but impotent\u201d.) We hear it today at its coarsest when English football fans sing about \u201cTen German bombers\u201d shot down by plucky British fighters, and then chant, \u201cFuck off Europe, we\u2019re all voting out.\u201d\n\nNot that myth-making is uniquely British. Many European countries have vivid national legends, not least those stemming from the last war, such as the legend of the French resistance (and of the \u201cGerman resistance to Hitler\u201d). Our own is of course the Finest Hour of 1940-41, when \u201cwe stood alone\u201d, in Churchill\u2019s dubious phrase. It was not pure fiction \u2013 the self-sacrificial resolution of that hour really was fine \u2013 although we were far from \u201calone\u201d even then: this precious stone set in the silver sea was sustained by the great material and human resources of the Commonwealth and empire, not to say by Polish and Czech fighter pilots and the Norwegian merchant fleet. As for shooting down bombers, or the other comforting legend that \u201cwe won the war\u201d, the fact is that Germany was defeated by the Red Army, and Japan was defeated by the US Navy, as well as a couple of atom bombs.\n\nThere was nothing fictional in the belief that the Third Reich had been deeply evil, and that defeating it had been worthwhile. And so, as Tony Judt observed more than 20 years ago in his prescient little book Europe, A Grand Illusion?, Great Britain was the only country in what is now the EU, apart from Finland, to emerge from the war with nothing to be ashamed of. But lack of shame can become foolish vanity.\n\nIn the years after the war, the atmosphere was one of subdued contentment, well caught by Sir Michael Howard, a famous historian in the making who was then at Oxford, having returned from the war in which he had fought. As he says in his memoir Captain Professor, the intellectual fashion was supposed to be for Sartre, Heidegger and Kierkegaard, but they were \u201cphilosophers of a defeat we had not experienced and a despair that we did not feel\u201d.\n\nAnd yet that became a problem in itself. Victory in some ways hurt us more than a defeat: we were bolstered with pride, but living beyond our imperial, military, economic, political and emotional means. In the fourth volume of his account of the first world war, published in 1929, Churchill had grandiloquently pronounced: \u201cThe conclusion of the Great War raised England to the highest position she has yet attained.\u201d That was dubious then, but he could not possibly have said as much after VE Day. If anything, a British leader might (but would not) have borrowed Emperor Hirohito\u2019s words after Hiroshima, when he announced the Japanese surrender with masterly understatement: \u201cThe war situation has developed not necessarily to Japan\u2019s advantage, while the general trends of the world have all turned against her interest.\u201d\n\nBy 1945, victory or no, half of Europe was in Soviet hands, the decline and fall of the British empire was under way, this blessed plot was a bankrupt debtor, dependent on an American generosity that was not immediately forthcoming. \u201cWe threw good housekeeping to the winds. But we saved ourselves, and helped to save the world,\u201d said the economist John Maynard Keynes. Now, as he also said, the British faced \u201ca financial Dunkirk\u201d. The 70 years since have in many ways been a story of the British coming to terms with events \u2013 or failing to do so.\n\nThe illusions were not confined to the Conservative party. For all its achievements, anyone can see in hindsight that Attlee\u2019s Labour government was far too ambitious, attempting to build a New Jerusalem of universal healthcare and public welfare, while also retaining huge imperial and military commitments. It was the Attlee government, with Ernest Bevin as foreign secretary, that would decide to build a British atomic bomb, would help create the Nato alliance, and would go to war in Korea.\n\nSpeaking in the Commons, Bevin insisted that Great Britain was still a great power. In private, he was contradicted by Sir Henry Tizard, scientist, Whitehall middleman, and a patriot whose work ensuring that radar was installed around the coastline by 1940, had been decisive in the Battle of Britain. In 1949, Tizard wrote a remarkable memorandum, concerned with the pointless endeavour to build an \u201cindependent\u201d nuclear deterrent. \u201cWe persist in regarding ourselves as a Great Power capable of everything and only temporarily handicapped by economic difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not a Great Power and never will be again. We are a great nation, but if we continue to behave like a Great Power we shall soon cease to be a great nation.\u201d Tizard\u2019s wise words might be an epigraph \u2013 and an epitaph \u2013 for our story since then.\n\nTwo years later, Churchill was back at Downing Street, while a young queen was crowned in 1953. Still the mood was one of smug complacency \u2013 what did Europe matter? \u2013 and the media wrote excitedly about a new Elizabethan age. As Michael Howard again recalled, they spoke truer than they knew: \u201cOnce again we were, as we had been then, a power of the second rank, teetering on the verge of bankruptcy and punching far beyond our weight in international affairs.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest British businessman and politician Oliver Smedley leaving to demonstrate in Rome as part of his campaign against British membership of the EEC, in 1967. Photograph: John Downing/Getty Images\n\nOne of the comical sideshows of the referendum has been the continual invocation of Churchill, by both sides, including a pro-remain letter to the Times that memorably began \u201cAs descendants of Marlborough, Wellington and Churchill,\u201d from the present Duke of Wellington and Churchill\u2019s grandson, Sir Nicholas Soames. Churchill may have been a great national leader at one crucial moment in history, but since, in the course of an enormously long career, he held at one time or another almost every possible opinion on every known question \u2013 and was often demonstrably and disastrously wrong, on matters military (Gallipoli), financial (the gold standard), or political (Indian self-government) \u2013 it seems odd that he is cited as an oracle of eternal wisdom and truth.\n\nTwo particular postwar illusions were Churchill\u2019s own work. In March 1946, at Fulton in Missouri, in his famous \u201ciron curtain\u201d speech, he said that there needed to be \u201ca special relationship between the British Commonwealth and empire and the United States\u201d, while he also hailed \u201cthe abiding power of the British empire and Commonwealth\u201d. These two notions would bedevil the British ever after \u2013 Labour just as much as Tories. As Max Hastings has put it, \u201cthe notion of a \u2018special relationship\u2019 was invented for reasons of political expediency by Winston Churchill, who then became the first of many prime ministers to discover it to be a myth.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time we have to decide between Europe and the open sea,\u201d Churchill shouted at de Gaulle in 1944, \u201cit is always the open sea we shall choose. Every time I have to choose between you and Roosevelt, I will always choose Roosevelt.\u201d\n\nBut what did Roosevelt\u2019s heirs think, those who held power in Washington? In December 1962, Dean Acheson, a former secretary of state, delivered the famous speech in which he said, almost as an aside, that \u201cGreat Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role\u201d. He continued, \u201cThe attempt to play a separate power role \u2013 that is, a role apart from Europe, a role based on a \u2018special relationship\u2019 with the United States, a role based on being head of a \u2018Commonwealth\u2019 which has no political structure, or unity, or strength \u2013 this role is about played out.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to recapture, or understand, the outrage this statement of the obvious caused in London, where everyone from the House of Commons to Fleet Street screeched angrily that it was a stab in the back. And yet even Acheson could not have guessed how prophetic his words would prove. The British remained haunted by their memories of global might, and the fantasy that Tizard had dismissed of still being a great power. Thatcher\u2019s triumph in the Falklands in 1982 only reinforced this belief.\n\nIf hostility to the European Union is often now seen as a rightwing or even reactionary cause \u2013 the preserve of Ukip and of Tory zealots \u2013 that was not always so. It was Attlee\u2019s Labour government that first rebuffed the movement towards a new Europe. When the European Coal and Steel Community was founded in 1951 as the germ of what would become the EU, one minister said that \u201ceven if desirable, such a scheme could hardly prove to be workable\u201d. Hugh Gaitskell, Attlee\u2019s successor as Labour leader, said that joining the Common Market would be to turn our backs on \u201ca thousand years of history\u201d.\n\nIn the early days of the European project, it might be remembered, there were plenty of objections to it that were far from narrowly nationalistic. In protestant northern Europe there lingered a suspicion, held by, among others, Tage Erlander, the Social Democratic prime minister of Sweden from 1946 to 1969, that the Common Market was a Roman Catholic conspiracy. And on the left there was a further suspicion, that it was a capitalist conspiracy. Since \u201cEuropeanism\u201d did have some of its roots in Catholic social teaching, and the form of political Catholicism we know as Christian Democracy (all six foreign ministers who signed the Coal and Steel treaty in 1951 were Christian Democrats), and since the Common Market was plainly a bastion against Marxist socialism, these suspicions were not absurd.\n\nA fear of popery might have appealed to some Tories. But if anything, in the early days, Tories were more likely to be cosmopolitan and Europhile than Labour. One of Churchill\u2019s former acolytes, Robert Boothby, was an enthusiast for the United Europe movement, and in 1949 became a delegate to the Council of Europe. The 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, which now so enrages Tory Europhobes since it was incorporated into British law by the 1998 Human Rights Act, was largely drafted by English lawyers, and Conservatives at that \u2013 notably David Maxwell Fyfe, a later home secretary and lord chancellor. And when the British belatedly repented their haughty disdain for the European project, and applied to join, it was under Harold Macmillan\u2019s Tory government.\n\nIn the end, it was Edward Heath\u2019s Conservative government that \u201ctook us into Europe\u201d in 1973. And when the first referendum was held in 1975, one of the keenest of campaigners for staying in the Common Market was Thatcher, the newly elected Conservative leader. She can be seen in photographs looking rather fetching in a pullover patterned with the flags of the European nations. \u201cThe paramount case for being in,\u201d she said, is \u201cthe political case for peace and security.\u201d Her language has been reiterated this year by Cameron and George Osborne, with less success.\n\nDuring her time in office, Thatcher grew hostile to what she saw as an increasing centralising tendency by the Brussels Eurocracy under Jacques Delors; hence her \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d to his exalted idea of a United States of Europe. By the end, Europe had driven her slightly mad \u2013 it has that effect on people \u2013 and contributed to her downfall. But her soul marched on. An embittered faction of Thatcherites who had never accepted her overthrow fomented trouble against John Major\u2019s government, with a prolonged rebellion against parliamentary ratification of the 1992 Maastricht treaty, which turned the European Community into the European Union, without notably uniting Europe in any emotional sense.\n\nPlenty of those reading this may tend to view \u201cEurope\u201d in a benevolent light. But any honest remainer must admit that there is a very strong case against \u201cactually existing Europe\u201d. The European Union is dysfunctional, corrupt, and afflicted by a kind of corporate folie de grandeur. Part of the tragedy of our predicament is that the wrong people have been making a critique of \u201cEurope\u201d. There were always honourable radical or liberal reasons for opposing European integration and centralism \u2013 as exemplified by Maastricht.\n\nIt was with Maastricht, the meeting and then the treaty of the same name, that the first steps were taken to admit the former Soviet bloc territories well before they had caught up with western Europe economically, which was arguably a mistake, and to create the single currency, which was unarguably an enormous mistake, and one for which tens of millions of young people in southern Europe are now paying an awful price.\n\nThe only special relationship Washington is interested in is one in which London provides a link to Brussels and Berlin\n\nIf the EU is to survive, it needs drastic reform, and demanding such reform is what could be called the true Eurosceptic position. But reform can only be achieved from inside. The Europhobes\u2019 problem is that, with all their instinctive antipathy to Europe, they have no practical alternative to offer, except nostalgic national legends.\n\nSome Europhobes, of course, believe that we can turn away from Europe because we will always have the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the US. They seem not to have grasped the supreme irony of their position. While happy to prostrate themselves before the United States \u2013 to see those 1,000 years of history ending with England as a client state of Washington and the British Army serving as the American foreign legion \u2013 they have failed to notice how keen American politicians have been that we should remain in the EU. The only \u201cspecial relationship\u201d Washington is interested in is one in which London provides a link to Brussels and Berlin. Not only has the Commonwealth long since ceased to have any political meaning, what Gerhard Schr\u00f6der called \u201cthe special relationship so special that only the English know it exists\u201d means nothing to Americans even when they pay polite lip service to it.\n\nLooking back at this melancholy story, it is hard to doubt that intelligent Euroscepticism in the true sense has been in too-short supply. De Gaulle offered some, when he spoke of a \u201cEurope des patries\u201d, a close confederation of sovereign states, rather than an impossible \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d.\n\nIf nothing else, this squalid campaign has surely made Attlee\u2019s and Thatcher\u2019s point about referendums playing into the hands of demagogues.

But maybe a better term in the case of the folly and weakness of the modern Tory party is European tragedy. For, as a broken David Cameron announced his resignation on Friday morning, one question must have been battering his exhausted brain more than any other.\n\n\n\nHow was it that a modern-minded liberal Conservative leader who long ago told his party to \u201cstop banging on about Europe\u201d if it wanted to get back into power after three successive defeats \u2013 and who then delivered two terms in government \u2013 has himself been brought down by that same party over that same European question?\n\nCameron himself played the role of tragic hero as he notified the nation of his intention to step down before the autumn. \u201cThere can be no doubt about the result,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British people have voted to leave the European Union and their will must be respected.\u201d\n\nBut he added that the tortuous negotiations ahead with the EU would require \u201cstrong determined and committed leadership\u201d that he felt he could no longer provide. \u201cThe country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.\u201d\n\nAnd there seemed scant consolation in his laconic summary of what he would rather be remembered for. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve made great steps, with more people in work than ever before in our history, with reforms to welfare and education, increasing people\u2019s life chances, building a bigger and stronger society, keeping our promises to the poorest people in the world and enabling those who love each other to get married whatever their sexuality, but above all restoring Britain\u2019s economic strength.\u201d\n\nAll of that is likely to be forgotten in the European tumult. The warnings from history could not have been clearer. Party divisions over Europe had been the undoing of both Cameron\u2019s predecessors as Conservative prime minister. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s fall in 1990 was triggered by her increasingly anti-European rhetoric and stance. John Major\u2019s long slide to defeat in 1997 was powered by his inability to prevent poisonous divisions over the Maastricht treaty on European integration. Right from the start of his own rise to the top, Cameron knew the dangers.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Thatcher leaving 10 Downing Street for the last time as Prime Minister. Photograph: Lennox Ken/Alamy\n\nYet the faultlines in Cameron\u2019s own approach to Europe were always there too. The young Cameron was never one of those Tories who ate, drank and slept Europe; but nor was he an heir to the pro-European generation of liberal Tories such as Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke. Instead, fatally as it has now transpired, he was always a \u201cEurosceptic \u2013 but not as Eurosceptic as you are\u201d, as he put it to his first political boss, the former chancellor Norman Lamont. Cameron\u2019s lifelong soft Euroscepticism meant he had no answer to the hardliners on Europe once the issue had become turbocharged by austerity and immigration.\n\nCameron\u2019s differences with the more committed Eurosceptic wing of his party have always been over emphasis and tone, not substance. He has had no alternative vision of Europe to offer, in the face of the party\u2019s Europhobes. Although he was always in favour of remaining, he failed to make the case for UK membership until almost the last minute. If Cameron\u2019s default position had always been \u201cEurosceptic \u2013 but determined to make Europe work\u201d, things might have been different. But it was the opposite. \u201cI\u2019m much more Eurosceptic than you imagine,\u201d he once told Labour\u2019s Denis MacShane.\n\nWhen he was first running for parliament in the Oxfordshire constituency of Witney, which he won in 2001, Cameron characteristically tried to have the best of both Tory worlds on the issue. He should be thought of as a Eurosceptic, he told the centre-right libertarian Sean Gabb, \u201con the basis that I oppose the single currency and any further transfer of sovereignty from the UK to the EU\u201d. But, Cameron added, he was not in favour of withdrawal and accepted the supremacy of EU law in some cases.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Cameron in 2002. Photograph: Martin Argles/The Guardian\n\n\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d he repeated in a Guardian article in May 2003 about the EU constitution plan, which Tony Blair supported but on which the Labour party was reluctant to allow a referendum, \u201cI am no Euro obsessive\u201d. Readers could not accuse him of \u201cexcessive Daily Mail reading, too much time spent alone with Bill Cash or anything else\u201d. But, he added, \u201cthe Euro-maniac Blair\u201d would have to concede a referendum on \u201cthe wretched thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Eurosceptic, no shadow of doubt,\u201d the Tory pro-European grandee Sir Nicholas Soames told Lord Ashcroft and Isabel Oakeshott for their anti-Cameron biography Call Me Dave. \u201cHe\u2019s immensely irritated by it and frustrated by it in every way. But he\u2019s not a Get Out man.\u201d\n\nBut nor was he ever explicitly enough a Stay In man. In 2005, as he began campaigning to succeed Michael Howard as the liberal and modernising alternative to what Theresa May famously called \u201cnasty party\u201d Toryism, Cameron promised that, under him, the Tories would pull out of the European People\u2019s party alliance in the European parliament. He did it because he wanted to siphon votes from his rivals David Davis and Liam Fox by burnishing his own Eurosceptic credentials.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Angela Merkel and David Cameron. Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nIt is doubtful if that promise was decisive in Cameron\u2019s victory as party leader. But it is certain that the decision drove a wedge between the Tories and their Christian Democratic, centre-right fellow parties in Europe. In particular it poisoned relations and trust with Angela Merkel, who was to be the key figure in European politics in the years ahead. Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, Cameron put tactics before strategy in his handling of Europe.\n\nSo, when Cameron made his famous remarks to the Tory conference in 2006, his first speech as leader to the party, the warnings were more tactical than strategic. \u201cInstead of talking about the things that most people care about, we talked about what we cared about most,\u201d he reminded his party as he assessed the Tories\u2019 third successive electoral defeat at Blair\u2019s hands. \u201cWhile parents worried about childcare, getting the kids to school, balancing work and family life, we were banging on about Europe.\u201d\n\nMany saw these words, especially in retrospect, as an attempt to shift the way the party approached Europe. But the words were an attack on the consequences of the party\u2019s approach, not on the approach itself. Cameron was being consistent with his own soft Euroscepticism, not innovative in the way that might have equipped him to fight his corner more effectively when the referendum came in 2016.\n\nBack in 2007, when Europe was gearing up for what became the Lisbon treaty on EU reforms, Cameron was again consistent in his own terms. First he pledged \u201ca cast-iron guarantee\u201d from the Tories to hold a referendum on the treaty. Two years later, with the general election now approaching, Cameron declared the guarantee was no longer relevant, since the treaty was now law and could not be reopened. He had managed both to fire up the hardliners and to outrage them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Cameron in No 10 with his adviser Steve Hilton, who later joined the leave campaign. Photograph: REX Shutterstock\n\nYet Cameron did not make a virtue of his change of policy on the treaty by embracing it \u2013 even though it embodied many of the less centralising approaches to Europe that he had advocated. Throughout this time, his adviser Steve Hilton was pressing for Cameron to prepare the ground for exit from Europe. In practice, however, Cameron neither prepared for exit nor for engagement. Instead the juggling act continued.\n\nThe 2010 election, which was in most respects a triumph for Cameron, ensured ever more frantic juggling. Going into coalition with the pro-European Liberal Democrats meant the referendum on UK membership of the EU that many Conservatives continued to advocate was put in the deep freeze. The coalition\u2019s official policy was that there would be no in/out referendum and that only Cameron and Nick Clegg could settle European policy between them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Cameron and Nick Clegg form a coalition in May 2010. Photograph: Daniel Deme/EPA\n\nThis was a purgatorial outcome for the hard Eurosceptics. Not only had Cameron made a coalition with the Liberal Dems, whom they despised; he had also sold the pass on Europe, again. The hard right\u2019s revenge came in October 2011 when the MP David Nuttall\u2019s motion for a referendum triggered the largest Tory postwar revolt on Europe, with 81 Eurosceptics voting against the government.\n\nTwo months later, Cameron tried to assuage his rebels by vetoing a eurozone rescue plan at an EU summit in Brussels. The clashes left Cameron isolated on both fronts. The Tory rebels, in Lord Finkelstein\u2019s words, never took yes for an answer. Meanwhile Merkel and many of the other heads of government were outraged at Cameron\u2019s defiance.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The rise of Ukip pushed more Tories towards a referendum. Photograph: Stephen Hird/Reuters\n\nAlthough Cameron still tended at this time to treat the EU issue as a party management problem, the eurozone crisis and migration pressures were beginning to transform the issue into something much larger, much angrier and less manageable. The rise of Ukip \u2013 with whose policies a significant minority of Tory MPs agreed \u2013 pushed ever more Tories into the referendum camp. In June 2012, Cameron finally cracked and said a referendum might be necessary. From that moment the issue became when, not whether, Cameron would pledge a referendum as Tory policy at the next election.\n\n\n\nWhen a worried Clegg challenged him in 2012, Cameron\u2019s response was that of a tactical politician. \u201cI have to do this. It is a party management issue. I am under a lot of pressure on this. I need to recalibrate,\u201d he told Clegg, according to David Laws\u2019s account of the coalition.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so busy wondering how to get through the next few weeks that he could endanger Britain\u2019s international position for the next few decades. It\u2019s all very very risky,\u201d Clegg told Laws in 2012, wholly accurately as things were to turn out. When Clegg put this to Cameron later in 2012, Cameron\u2019s reply was eloquent and to the point: \u201cYou may be right. But what else can I do? My backbenchers are unbelievably Eurosceptic and Ukip are breathing down my neck.\u201d\n\nAfter a long buildup, Cameron finally made his referendum pledge in 2013 in a speech at the Bloomberg offices in central London. The speech put the promise in the context of an unusually eloquent argument by Cameron for Britain to remain in the EU. Perhaps if he had gone into the 2015 election emphasising that Britain must stay, he would have been in a stronger position to stem the slide of ministers and backbenchers into the leave campaign in 2016. But Cameron didn\u2019t do that. Once again, he let the issue go off the boil. Meanwhile, though, the pressure from immigration and the fear of Ukip transformed the political climate. Cameron only began to make the case to remain in the weeks running up to this week\u2019s vote. By then the damage had been done.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cameron makes his Bloomberg speech. Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA\n\nAlthough Cameron had been expecting another hung parliament in 2015, he emerged from the general election unencumbered by coalition. As a result, the referendum pledge made at Bloomberg and set in stone in the Tory manifesto had to be banked. Throughout late 2015 and early 2016, Cameron bargained for concessions from EU partners whose minds were far more focused on the continued economic crisis, immigration from Syria and elsewhere, and terrorism.\n\nBritish Euroscepticism: a brief history Read more\n\nThe deal Cameron unveiled at the end of the Brussels summit on 19 February might have been a strong enough package to sell to an electorate that wanted to back a popular prime minister \u2013 as Harold Wilson\u2019s equivalent deal was when Britain voted to stay in Europe in 1975. But times had changed. Cameron may have promised to fight \u201cheart and soul\u201d for Britain to stay in, but immigration, an impatient electorate and the absolute determination of the anti-European press and hard-sceptic MPs ensured that 2016 would be completely different.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Cameron leaves EU headquarters in Brussels, February 2016. Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA\n\nIn the end, Cameron has been faced with forces and dynamics in British life that he has proved powerless to control. Indignation about immigration, disrespect for politicians, a reluctance to be frightened by warnings, press distortions and Labour\u2019s weakness in delivering its vote all did their bit to fuel a general mood of popular payback against the political and economic establishment, as well as the EU. The remain campaign threw everything but the kitchen sink at their leave opponents, but the assaults only seemed to strengthen the mood of defiance. Even the killing of Jo Cox did nothing more than cause a temporary lull in the leave mood.\n\nThree years ago, in a comment on Cameron\u2019s referendum pledge in the Bloomberg speech, Tony Blair likened it to a comedy western of the 1970s. \u201cIt reminds me a bit of the Mel Brooks comedy Blazing Saddles where the sheriff says at one point as he holds a gun to his own head: \u2018If you don\u2019t do what I want I\u2019ll blow my brains out,\u2019\u201d Blair warned.\n\nThis week, Cameron has done just that.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b92c4f8e2eeb1d7c7a9d15f0bf5dc1008d4568/191_340_1728_1037/1728.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4cf31576c8ac0b743d992eb39934d62e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96ae9b66364eb23c9121f9acff9d318f41c81027/40_370_2863_1718/master/2863.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e840bb96df4b78a088e9654e653c7697", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=David+Cameron%2CBrexit%2CPolitics%2CConservatives%2CEuropean+Union%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CForeign+policy%2CEurope", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f73c913045eb7863bca5f16a2ed504fb509fd11/0_107_1728_1037/master/1728.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8934ccb7a6a593ebd98b12b381d078f7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3c70941d87d1a1b24b8daa1210bd69dee885e6/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=76c84febf0e27c6866f7c41da2719451", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e474b2b293c24aea04d7002a0e999c60a6f6a60/219_140_3410_2046/master/3410.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1390662a35b2dfebce862721f3859604", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be1741c5e0b461ab0fef6c7596447b7843af624/0_193_2485_1491/master/2485.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e9f204dc765d61149954f9335464f820", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5648118abfc529381358393fdd7f5b8e8bb710d8/0_102_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0a24a2399410d48737a5a4195d3d1731", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02e8b32b0f4eaf77be61e82a23cb03c5deccc6e3/0_17_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0430bd493c270635a8f0e66406a3fd83", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a0f4deceb92b6e6840e890b393e9980461f5c3/0_214_1871_1123/master/1871.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b8ec653bccd6a5f418f4f7b46c3a9c4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Martin-Kettle,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=091ab82b07d8814ec94d168c36a0ec9f"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b92c4f8e2eeb1d7c7a9d15f0bf5dc1008d4568/191_340_1728_1037/1728.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4cf31576c8ac0b743d992eb39934d62e", "date": "24/06/2016"}, "rank_13": {"title": "How did UK end up voting to leave the European Union?", "text": "Britain\u2019s self-ejection from Europe is the culmination not just of four months of heady campaigning but four decades of latent Euroscepticism, which, through good times and bad, never really went away.\n\nCampaigners have agitated for EU withdrawal ever since the UK joined the common market in 1973. Labour\u2019s official policy for the next decade was to quit, and a sizeable proportion of Conservatives have never been comfortable Europeans.\n\nThe issue hounded John Major\u2019s premiership, lay dormant through the Tony Blair years before rearing its head once again as the economy turned sour at the end of the last decade.\n\nDavid Cameron was keen to move his party away from \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d after he became leader. But once in Downing Street, he found it impossible to resist pressure from his backbenchers to call a poll as the idea of leaving the EU gained wider traction in the country with the rise of Ukip, populist rage against remote elites and discontent about immigration.\n\nBrexit, a term coined in 2012 before becoming mainstream political currency last year, moved from being a niche obsession to a victorious, mainstream political movement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Former prime ministers Sir John Major (left) and Tony Blair share a platform for the remain campaign. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/PA\n\nBackbench bravado\n\nAs prime minister, Cameron tried to throw his restless Eurosceptic backbenchers enough red meat to keep them happy \u2013 like withdrawing from the centre-right federalist EPP group in the European parliament.\n\nHowever, this would never be enough for the right of the Conservative party \u2013 from Iain Duncan Smith to John Redwood \u2013 who would stop at almost nothing to free the UK from what they see as rule by Brussels, even at the expense of tearing apart their party.\n\nCameron\u2019s troubles began as it became clear that the 2010 intake of Tories was more Eurosceptic than the last, as they set about applying pressure for a referendum from the outset.\n\nAs early as October 2011, David Cameron realised he was facing years of trench warfare with Eurosceptic backbenchers after 81 Conservative MPs supported a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the largest postwar rebellion on Europe. John Baron, the Tory MP for Basildon and Billericay in Essex, was one of the ringleaders with a letter from 100 colleagues demanding a referendum on the EU in July 2012.\n\nCameron thought he had scored a Margaret Thatcher-style victory when he vetoed a rise in the EU budget later that year, but the episode appeared to inflame anti-Brussels feeling. In December of that year, Boris Johnson publicly called on Cameron to attempt to renegotiate Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU before calling a referendum.\n\nThe prime minister finally committed to an EU vote in January 2013 with what has become known as his Bloomberg speech, promising to renegotiate and then call a referendum by the end of 2017. Those familiar with his thinking at the time say Cameron had what was, in hindsight, an overoptimistic belief that he could lance the boil of Tory Euroscepticism by making such a promise.\n\nIt was also unlikely he would ever have to call such a poll because the Conservatives did not believe they would win an overall majority and could rely on the Lib Dems to veto the plan, like they did before 2015. However, Cameron\u2019s victory last year, partially on the back of the promise of a referendum, meant there was no turning back.\n\n\n\nThe migration factor\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rival groups of protesters demonstrate over the migrant crisis in Folkestone last August. Photograph: LNP/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nPolling suggests discontent with the scale of migration to the UK has been the biggest factor pushing Britons to vote out, with the contest turning into a referendum on whether people are happy to accept free movement in return for free trade.\n\n\n\nPublic unease has been fuelled by a failure to prevent immigration from piling pressure on jobs markets and public services, and a refusal by politicians to acknowledge the sheer numbers of Europeans making new homes in the UK after the EU\u2019s expansion east in 2004 and 2007.\n\nCameron promised before the 2010 election to bring migration down to the tens, not hundreds, of thousands. However, his failure to live up to his promise, repeated in 2015, has undermined trust in his leadership and contributed to a sense that UK politicians are powerless to lower migration from the EU.\n\nThe leave camp tried to make the arguments for Brexit more about the economy and sovereignty than immigration, but quickly found that \u201ctaking back control\u201d over immigration was the most resonant message. They also linked immigration to shortages of primary school places, difficulty in getting a GP appointment, and depressed wages.\n\n\n\nElite and aloof\n\nThe other force that welled up during the campaign was a wholehearted distaste for the thing that Brussels had become in the 40 years since Britain last voted in a referendum on its place in Europe.\n\nThe UK has never voted on being part of the EU, which was formed at the time of the Maastricht treaty in 1993 and expanded its remit from an economic community to include foreign affairs, justice and policing.\n\nThe leave camp argued that Brussels has been on a mission to expand its powers and sought further political integration, which is far removed from what the UK originally voted for. Voters appear to have decided that this was their one chance to leave a union they never particularly embraced and did not consent to in the first place.\n\nIt should not be forgotten that the referendum came at a time when populist revolts against elites were gaining momentum, from Eurosceptic parties in France, Germany, Austria and Scandinavia to Trump\u2019s brand of Republicanism in the US. The leave campaign has throughout painted the EU and Brussels officials as a hotbed of unaccountable political elites who were not democratically voted by the British people.\n\nDespite MEPs being elected and leaders on the EU council each having their own mandates, it has become a tenet of Euroscepticism that the union is too remote from the people it is governing. Brexit campaigners frequently cited the \u201cfive presidents\u201d of Europe, who they claimed no one had ever heard of, and pointed out that the unelected European commission proposes laws that end up passed by the parliament.\n\nIt hardly helped that the remain campaign was steered by almost the entire political establishment, with David Cameron, George Osborne and every living UK former prime minister from Tony Blair to John Major lining up to warn that leaving would be a terrible thing.\n\nThe Ukip factor\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Ukip delegate wears badges and a Union flag tie at the party\u2019s annual conference in central London. Photograph: Luke Macgregor/Reuters\n\nCameron might never have called the referendum had it not been for the rise and rise of Nigel Farage and Ukip. By January 2013, when the prime minister called the EU vote, Ukip had started to gain traction in local elections and was polling in double digits for the first time. There was a feeling that several Tory backbenchers could defect if Cameron failed to heed their calls for a plebiscite.\n\nEven after promising the referendum, Farage managed to gain millions of votes in the 2015 election, many of them in Labour areas as well as Conservatives. His frequent media appearances also helped cement a link between immigration and the EU in the public mind, preparing the ground for leave\u2019s successful referendum campaign long before it officially kicked off.\n\nToo little, too late\n\nDavid Cameron overplayed his hand on EU reform when he raised hopes that he might be able to curb free movement in an FT article in November 2013. He aimed high but quickly had to water down what he was seeking from other EU leaders who were not prepared to open up the fundamental principle.\n\nRealising his error, the prime minister then tried to make the issue about limiting benefits for migrants, rather than restricting numbers. His final negotiation, announced in February, came back with a ban on migrants getting full benefits for four years after arriving with no detail about how the tapering system would work.\n\nCameron tried to make the best of his renegotiation, hailing it as a major success that he got the 27 other member states to agree. However, the process ended up cementing the impression that Brussels was inflexible and unwilling to make big concessions to keep Britain in the union.\n\nBoris Johnson and Michael Gove for leave\n\nWhen the two political big beasts and friends of Cameron came out for\n\nBrexit, it gave a huge boost to the leave campaign. Brexit had previously been caricatured as an obsession of very rightwing Conservatives and Ukippers but Johnson and Gove legitimised the push for leaving the EU.\n\nBoth highly articulate and savvy media performers, they made it more of a fight between equals against Cameron and Osborne. Johnson\u2019s personal popularity seemingly across many different sections of society may also have made a difference as he crisscrossed the country in a battlebus selling a better Britain outside of the EU.\n\nMatters were not helped by equivocating on the part of Labour, whose leadership never looked truly comfortable campaigning with Cameron, and some of whose traditional support has drifted off towards Ukip in the belief that it will address concerns about immigration more robustly than metropolitan Labour MPs.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0337f3a7a94ce0f86a4877922d0682f20e087b/0_153_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d8879c88bc458dfc33a39368de891167", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eccaa93a5dc4974f80fbcbcfcb0d287c6b177ae6/0_243_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a616189a8d76c97f8971f965a8bb7304", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2099ae4e46ce19ccca0758060e9dc7530366adc/0_180_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e12e792f33ef8ad234e5f92904bbbce", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eef8efe96d96fd691a18270372ad7d082e67e7c/0_371_4810_2886/4810.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ba9c570c4b5bfc79ad8c13d430eaf9e", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eef8efe96d96fd691a18270372ad7d082e67e7c/0_371_4810_2886/4810.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ba9c570c4b5bfc79ad8c13d430eaf9e", "date": "24/06/2016"}, "rank_165": {"title": "How Brexit is reshaping domestic politics in EU member states", "text": "Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU has not just upended the UK political scene. It is beginning to have a direct bearing on politics on the continent.\n\nGermany\n\nAngela Merkel made clear she is aware of the historical burden she carries to ensure the EU does not fall apart, with an emphatic statement to the Bundestag on Tuesday that she would try \u201cwith all my might\u201d to keep it together.\n\nBrexit also puts paid to doubts that she would not run for a third term in Germany\u2019s next general election, likely to take place in the autumn of 2017.\n\nThe German chancellor, referred to increasingly as the \u201cdinosaur of Europe\u201d, being by far its longest-serving leader, now has little choice but to take up the challenge \u2013 even though there has been no official announcement \u2013 or else risk her legacy becoming how the European Union failed on her watch.\n\nSome commentators have tried to suggest that Merkel holds some of the blame for Brexit, with Jan Fleischauer of Der Spiegel saying that pictures of refugees walking through Europe, a result of Merkel\u2019s open-door policy, were \u201cscaring the crap out of many Britons\u201d and sending the message, \u201cIf not even the disciplined Germans are willing or able to protect their borders, who else is capable of managing it?\u201d\n\nWhile there has been no comprehensive call for a German referendum on the future of the EU, the right-wing populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland will now use this opportunity to put more pressure on Merkel to instigate widespread institutional reforms. It has already indicated that it will put up a strong fight to ensure that Germany, already the largest net contributor to the EU\u2019s budget, does not increase its contribution to make up for the shortfall once Britain stops paying in.\n\nGerman economic interests are widely expected to be considerably affected by a Brexit. \u201cGermany is likely to be the biggest loser from the Brexit, apart from Britain itself,\u201d said Clemens Fuest, president of the Munich-based economic research institute, Ifo.\n\nHe estimates that Germany\u2019s economic performance could drop by as much as 3%, owing to the fact that the UK is Germany\u2019s third most important trade partner. German companies sell wares and services to the UK valued at around \u20ac120bn a year. A Brexit is expected to make trade far more difficult and expensive, with the car industry likely to be the worst hit: every fifth German car is exported to the UK.\n\nThe German chemical and pharmaceutical industry imports around \u20ac12.9bn of goods to the UK every year, as well as having invested \u20ac1.6bn in British companies, which it might now decide to at least in part withdraw.\n\nGerman companies with considerable UK dealings are likely to hold off on decision-making linked to investments or recruitment until the terms of the Brexit deal are clear. The delay and the uncertainty are also likely to lead to lost revenue and opportunities, German economists have warned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A protest in Berlin against the EU\u2019s negotiations for the TTIP and CETA trade agreements with the US and Canada. Photograph: Wolfram Steinberg/EPA\n\nAs to the potential profiteers, much attention is being given to Frankfurt which, as the home of the European Central Bank, is in a strong position to receive many of the banks and investment houses that have signalled they may leave London. Among them is Deutsche Bank, which has indicated it might bring to Frankfurt the 9,000 traders currently working for it in London.\n\nFrance\n\nThe UK\u2019s vote for Brexit will have a big impact on the 2017 presidential campaign.\n\nPolling for the Pew Research Center this month found French people were even more Eurosceptic than the British: only 38% of the French are in favour of the EU against 44% in Britain.\n\nThe Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande knows only too bitterly that Europe is not a vote-winning issue in France; his own party still hasn\u2019t fully recovered from its divisions of over France\u2019s 2005 Europe referendum, when France voted no to the European constitution.\n\nIf there was a new treaty setting out clear choices for Europe, I don\u2019t see how we could refuse [a referendum] Nicolas Sarkozy\n\nBut Paris\u2019s vision for the EU and relationship with Europe will now become a much bigger issue at the heart of the presidential campaign.\n\nHollande was elected in 2012 on a promise to turn Europe around and save it from one-size-fits-all austerity. Voters don\u2019t see him as having achieved that and he is the least popular president on record. He hopes to use the Brexit crisis as as a last-ditch attempt to restyle himself as a powerful force for change, promising to make Europe more relevant and attractive, particularly by deepening the relationship on security and defence.\n\nBut France \u2013 still struggling to meet the EU\u2019s fiscal rules \u2013 is the economically weaker partner in the Paris\u2013Berlin axis and time is short for Hollande to kickstart a new European project less than 10 months from the presidential election.\n\nOn the mainstream right, contenders in the primary race to be the candidate for Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s Les R\u00e9publicains party are setting out their stall. Alain Jupp\u00e9, a key contender, has said Europe needs to be \u201cre-invented\u201d. He argued that once that overhaul had been decided \u2013 at a point far into the future \u2013 a referendum would be needed on \u201cEurope\u2019s reconstruction, not only in France but all countries concerned\u201d.\n\nThe same has been suggested by Emmanuel Macron, Hollande\u2019s young, ambitious economy minister, who is currently weighing up whether to run for president himself.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest French far-right Front National leader Marine Le Pen is jubilant about Brexit. Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP\n\nSarkozy, whose popularity is rising among his party members and who still has a chance of becoming the mainstream right\u2019s presidential contender, has himself pushed for a redesign of the European Union and a new European treaty. \u201cWe should not be afraid of the people,\u201d Sarkozy said. \u201cIf there was a new treaty setting out clear choices for Europe, I don\u2019t see how we could refuse [a referendum].\u201d\n\nBut these calls are for a far-off referendum on a new European project, not on membership itself.\n\nMarine Le Pen, leader of the Eurosceptic, anti-immigration, far-right Front National \u2013 who is jubilant about Brexit \u2013 is the only one pushing for an in-out referendum in France along the same lines as the UK.\n\nThe economic impact of Brexit on France could also play its part in the presidential election if it has a knock-on effect on the tentative upturn in France\u2019s fragile and crisis-hit economy.\n\nSpain\n\nThe leaders of Spain\u2019s main political parties cannot be accused of underplaying the possible impact of Brexit on Sunday\u2019s elections.\n\nMariano Rajoy, the leader of the conservative People\u2019s party (PP), had cautioned that it was \u201cnot the moment to fuel or increase uncertainty\u201d. Pedro S\u00e1nchez, head of the PSOE, was blunter still. \u201cIf you stay ay home, things turn out like they have in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cThe extremes call the shots, fear votes, hope doesn\u2019t \u2013 and then people regret staying at home.\u201d And while Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Unidos Podemos, said Brexit was a sad day for Europe, he couldn\u2019t help noting that the UK\u2019s rejection of the EU had highlighted some of the union\u2019s failings.\n\n\u201cNo one would want to leave a fair and supportive Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to change Europe.\u201d\n\nIt has been suggested that such fears helped to alter the outcome of Spain\u2019s second general election in six months. With anxiety and panic convulsing the continent, the theory goes, many voters decided to stick with traditional parties such as the PP and the PSOE rather than back radical newcomers such as Unidos Podemos.\n\nThe results certainly suggest that Brexit may have had an effect: the PP picked up more votes than last time while the socialists held on to second place after the much-predicted Unido Podemos surge failed to materialise.\n\nEmilio S\u00e1enz-Franc\u00e9s, professor of history and international relations at Madrid\u2019s Comillas Pontifical University, believes that while many factors were in play, Brexit may have acted as a cautionary tale for some voters. \u201cIt may have had an effect when it came to persuading a certain proportion of voters to return to traditional Spanish voting values and to the more conventional and traditional parties like the PP and the PSOE,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think that Brexit has had an awareness-raising effect on Spanish voters and has highlighted the danger of voting purely on the basis of protest.\u201d\n\nBut Spain appears unlikely to follow Britain\u2019s lead. Joining the EU just a few short years after the death of Franco and the country\u2019s return to democracy remains one of the country\u2019s greatest economic and social successes \u2013 and one of its proudest moments.\n\n\n\nThe Five Star Movement could lose support after Brexit. Because there are very concrete and very tragic effects Lorenzo De Sio\n\nThat\u2019s not to say, however, that Brexit won\u2019t have have a lingering legacy. S\u00e1enz-Franc\u00e9s says Brexit \u201ccould generate a more critical kind of Europeanism; Spain may start to look at why Europe hasn\u2019t been more appealing to the British. But I can\u2019t see a majority of Spaniards thinking a country like Spain would be better off outside the EU.\u201d\n\nItaly\n\nItaly\u2019s usually jovial prime minister, Matteo Renzi, looked weary and worried as he took to the podium just hours after the Brexit result was announced. \u201cIn moments of difficulty, Europe brings out the best in itself. Long live Italy, long live Europe!\u201d said the young premier, standing beside the EU and Italian flags.\n\nSuch optimism revived Renzi\u2019s reputation as the poster boy of Europe, a title won after his Democratic party made huge gains in the European elections two years ago. But it also disguised underlying concerns that Brexit could have a negative impact on the Italian government, ahead of the country\u2019s own referendum later to be held in October.\n\n\n\nThe autumn referendum will invite Italians to vote on whether to approve the government\u2019s constitutional reforms \u2013 revamping the political system and slimming down regional powers \u2013 and Renzi has already staked his political career on the result. Recent polls have shown the premier facing a tough few months ahead, with up to 54% of the electorate voting down his proposals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Brexit result is likely to stregthen Italy\u2019s Eurosceptics \u2013 the far-right Northern League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (pictured). Photograph: Alessandro Di Meo/EPA\n\nThe Italian prime minister has denied the Brexit result would affect his own referendum, taking the opportunity to advertise a \u201cyes\u201d vote as a way to reduce waste and create a more simple political system. Renzi did, however, admit that the result could render the Eurosceptics of Italy \u2013 the far-right Northern League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement \u2013 stronger after Brexit.\n\n\u201cThe consequence is that today they are probably celebrating the result,\u201d Renzi said in a TG1 television interview on Sunday evening. \u201cBut we think that the overwhelming majority of Italians want to be in Europe.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic party is already reeling from significant gains made by the Five Star Movement in local elections this month, winning the mayorship in both Rome and Turin. The Northern League leader, Matteo Salvini, has thrown his full support behind Brexiters and gained popularity in recent years, but his party is not powerful enough to topple Renzi alone.\n\n\n\nThe future success of the populist movement and the referendum outcome now hinges on Renzi\u2019s reaction to Brexit, according to Lorenzo De Sio, a political science professor at Rome\u2019s Luiss University.\n\n\u201cIf Renzi is able to demonstrate he\u2019s decisive along with other European leaders, this could have a positive impact,\u201d said De Sio, who suggested that the fallout from the UK referendum could actually swing Italian voters back towards the mainstream.\n\n\u201cThe Five Star Movement could lose support after Brexit. Because after the protest vote there are very concrete and very tragic effects.\u201d\n\nGreece\n\nIn Greece, Europe\u2019s weakest link, the referendum result has been met with a robust mix of surprise, delight and fear. But as capitals digest the consequences of the vote, in Athens it is anxiety that has emerged as the dominant force across a divisive political scene.\n\nGreek tourism officials are bracing for a steep decline in last-minute bookings by Britons because of the plunging pound\n\nWith the taboo of exit now lifted, there is thinly disguised alarm that the country long at the epicentre of the eurozone\u2019s crisis could be next. Entirely dependent on international bailout funds to keep afloat, Greece\u2019s debt-stricken economy is especially vulnerable to uncertainty: its stock market lost more, globally, than any other within hours of the Brexit vote being announced.\n\nEmboldened by the outcome, eurosceptic extremists \u2013 led by the neo-fascist Golden Dawn \u2013 have said they hope it will herald the end of the German-dominated, austerity-obsessed bloc. Riding the anti-establishment populist wave, newspapers on both the left and right have exhorted prime minister Alexis Tsipras to exploit the moment. \u201cHe should tell foreigners to write off the debt and let us be \u2013 otherwise we will revolt and leave ourselves,\u201d proclaimed the daily Kontra News.\n\nThe leftist-led government knows it is walking a fine line. If Brexit results in further EU integration, Berlin \u2013 the biggest provider of rescue funds to date \u2013 may well take a much tougher stance with Athens over implementation of bailout commitments not least because Angela Merkel will want to placate the forces of Euroscepticism ahead of general elections in Germany next year.\n\n\u201cThere is a danger of tensions growing,\u201d the environment and energy minister Panos Skourletis told the Guardian. \u201cCompletion of the next evaluation of the Greek economy in October [key to dispensing further bailout funds] will depend on the political climate in Europe and whether our partners and lenders decide to take a more relaxing stance. After so many years of austerity the economy is exhausted, Greeks are exhausted, there is no room for even one more measure.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of Greece failing to achieve fiscal targets has been heightened by the adverse effects Brexit is likely to have on tourism and exports \u2013 both crucial to keeping the recession-hit economy on track. Already, Greek tourism officials are bracing for a steep decline in last-minute bookings by Britons because of the plunging pound.\n\nMore than 2.5 million UK citizens visited Greece last year, more than any other nation after Germany. Such losses will play into the hands of Eurosceptics at a time when the backlash against yet more gruelling austerity \u2013 pension and salary cuts, tax increases and benefit reversals set as the price of further bailout loans \u2013 is expected to mount.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10caa1a87ee967c218abf217a60886965fe7e889/0_251_3712_2227/master/3712.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c4db83e5d566c0711884852ee17ef9c0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CGermany%2CFrance%2CItaly%2CSpain%2CGreece%2CAngela+Merkel", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eae19bcd6865a7960d4b0ea9d11c4e0b9dea40a/149_191_2901_1741/master/2901.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5179ffee0c828fb327046420c2b78d3d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac1b3665929f87589443f3285feb5a680883c20/0_160_2329_1398/master/2329.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2ac916db2cc22afa3cbc057378444c9e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e355020b89885214535d45374b9414f6f65553c9/18_0_4772_2864/4772.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4725e69c4104a01df3e2649e6db0ddcc", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e355020b89885214535d45374b9414f6f65553c9/18_0_4772_2864/master/4772.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6975728ecbbdb17f742127d762156907", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e355020b89885214535d45374b9414f6f65553c9/18_0_4772_2864/4772.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4725e69c4104a01df3e2649e6db0ddcc", "date": "29/06/2016"}, "rank_117": {"title": "No EU exit for us, say Italy's on-the-rise Eurosceptics", "text": "Even the Five Star Movement is committed to EU membership in a country where Brexit is widely seen as a mistake\n\nItalians have looked aghast at the outcome of the Brexit vote, shocked by the rapid fall of political leaders in a nation previously admired for stability and common sense.\n\nDire economic performance in the bel paese (beautiful country) has seen hundreds of thousands of Italians move to the UK, which was until recently held up as an example of how a nation should be run.\n\nBut in the post-referendum era, Brits in Italy receive sympathetic looks as concerned locals seek to understand how UK voters could have made such a drastic choice. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake for them,\u201d says Luca Miccinilli, a shop worker in central Rome. \u201cMaybe they never really felt European.\u201d\n\nHis sentiment is echoed at a nearby coffee bar, where Brexit is described variously as a disaster, an erroneous choice, an irrational decision. \u201cI think it was a mistake, Europe\u2019s already in difficulty,\u201d remarks Simona Barnocchi at the counter. \u201cThey had less difficulty than us, because they had their own bank. Our economy isn\u2019t going well,\u201d she remarks as euros are dropped into the till.\n\nItaly was one of the EU\u2019s founding members and the union\u2019s flag flutters atop state buildings nationwide. But Brussels is certainly not viewed with great affection. The failure of Europe to respond adequately to refugees and migrants arriving on Italian shores, coupled with constant negotiations over the country\u2019s finances, has led to a sense of bitterness among many Italians.\n\nItaly\u2019s Five Star Movement now has to translate protest into problem-solving | Francesco Grillo Read more\n\nBut the suggestion Italy might follow in the UK\u2019s footsteps is broadly viewed as preposterous, with a post-Brexit poll finding that two thirds of Italians would vote to remain in the event of a referendum.\n\nThe outcome of the British vote was celebrated by the leader of the far-right Northern League, Matteo Salvini, who called for Italy to hold its own vote. But his party has lost support in recent weeks, with one poll showing just 12.4% of voters would back it.\n\nThe more significant rise has been that of the Eurosceptic Five Star Movement (M5S), an anti-establishment party founded by comedian Beppe Grillo. The M5S won a quarter of the national vote in 2013 and last month clinched the mayoral seats in Rome and Turin. Polls now show it has 30.6% of the vote, above the ruling Democratic party\u2019s 29.8%.\n\nLuigi Di Maio, the deputy speaker of the Italian parliament, has emerged as the most likely figure to lead the M5S at the next general election. He is critical of Brussels, but says the EU has become a scapegoat. \u201cIt was very often used by Italian politics as an alibi, it\u2019s not guilty of everything it has been blamed for,\u201d he told the Guardian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Luigi Di Maio, who is likely to lead the M5S into the next general election Photograph: Giorgio Cosulich/Getty Images\n\nBut he still saw failings. \u201cIt\u2019s an EU which has decided to abdicate from its role of protecting the internal market and protecting its citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite its Euroscepticism, the M5S is committed to EU membership, although it has called for a national referendum on the euro. \u201cA referendum which asks citizens if they want to remain in the euro, if they want to go in another direction, renegotiate the euro, or return to the lira,\u201d says Di Maio.\n\nSuch a vote would not be legally binding and the Italian government has not backed the idea. While Italians often complain that joining the single currency made them poorer, others are wary of the financial impact of returning to the lira.\n\nMarco Bertolini, an architect in Rome, counts out snacks at the coffee bar to demonstrate the economics of switching currencies. \u201cFor those who understand finance, if the lira were to come back, we would pay double,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not convincing, it\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, does not have an EU vote to worry about, he has put his career on the line by calling a different referendum in October. Italians are being asked to give the green light to the premier\u2019s package of reforms, an attempt to streamline the political system, which are opposed by the M5S.\n\nDon\u2019t vote remain for us Europeans \u2013 do it for yourselves | Matteo Renzi Read more\n\nRenzi has promised to resign if he loses this autumn and early elections could follow. Arianna Montanari, a professor at Rome\u2019s La Sapienza University, is however cautious of predicting that the M5S will soon govern Italy, believing a temporary government could be installed without a public vote if Renzi did stand down.\n\n\u201cIt also depends on how Rome works; it seems like it\u2019s not going so well,\u201d she said of Rome\u2019s new M5S mayor, Virginia Raggi, whose unenviable to-do list includes getting basic services such as rubbish collection to function properly.\n\nAn M5S government led by the young Di Maio, who turned 30 this month, would be a remarkable transformation of Italian politics. But the de-facto party leader is adamant that a vote for the M5S would not lead to a break with the EU: \u201cIn the throngs of Brexit, some have begun to speak of \u2018Italexit\u2019. But no one talked about this before.\u201d\n\nDi Maio is instead optimistic that Brexit could benefit Italy, suggesting it could attract businesses leaving London and looking for a new European hub. \u201cItaly could have a kind of recruitment drive, with taxation that allows companies that are there and want to come to Italy and contribute to the economic development of this country,\u201d he says.\n\nMilan, Italy\u2019s financial capital, is best positioned to benefit from such a situation. \u201cMilan has a number of advantages. The fact is that for the family of a banker in London, moving to Frankfurt would not be exciting,\u201d said Francesco Giavazzi, a professor at Bocconi University in Milan. But he notes Brexit could see Italian imports to the UK fall, as they become more expensive, and so Italy does not stand to gain hugely in financial terms.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Some hope that Milan, Italy\u2019s financial capital, may benefit from the Brexit vote by luring financial firms from London.

So far, despite constant criticism of the EU\u2019s monetary policy, a strong sense of European identity is outweighing any will to leave the union.\n\n\u201cI think that the original project was the right one.

It\u2019s all meant to convey the message that Slovakia is taking its current presidency of the council of the European Union extremely seriously.\n\nFor the next six months, the government of this small country of 5.5 million citizens will hold that rotating role. But all of its plans to set the agenda have suddenly become irrelevant. Brexit is the only agenda now. \u201cNo one saw it coming,\u201d said Dariusz Ka\u0142an, central European analyst at the Polish Institute of International Affairs. \u201cThe reactions across the region have been of genuine shock and helplessness.\u201d\n\nThe Slovakian prime minister, Robert Fico, is now faced with the herculean task of continuing with business as usual when nothing is as it was.\n\n\u201cThis is a brutal start for our presidency,\u201d his foreign minister, Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k , admitted to journalists. \u201cWe are in the centre of the volcano and everyone is looking to us.

Particularly palpable in central Europe, he said, was the fear that \u201cGermany and [Jean-Claude] Juncker [the commission president] will use a Brexit to help speed up EU integration, deeply opposed by Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, as they\u2019re afraid of simply being marginalised\u201d.\n\nBut the coming half-year could also be a chance for these central European countries \u2013 members of the Visegr\u00e1d group \u2013 to have their voices more clearly heard in the EU than ever before. \u201cThe genuine concerns of our citizens need to be better reflected,\u201d the group\u2019s four prime ministers said in a joint statement delivered last week, in which it appealed for the EU\u2019s executive to be restrained. \u201cInstead of endless theoretical debates on \u2018more Europe\u2019 or \u2018less Europe\u2019, we need to focus on \u2018better Europe\u2019,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWith the exit of the UK, the V4 will have lost their leading EU partner. London was always seen as an invaluable ally in Warsaw, Prague, Bratislava and Budapest because it shared a \u201ccommon perception of European problems\u201d, as Poland\u2019s foreign minister, Witold Waszczykowski, put it.\n\nBritain was also admired for the courageous decision to open its labour market to the new members immediately \u2013 unlike Germany and France, which instituted transitional arrangements. Thanks to that decision, an estimated 1.2 million people from the V4 live in the UK. But thanks to a looming Brexit, partly prompted by concerns over migration, they, like the EU itself, now face an unsure future.\n\nOf even greater concern to V4 leaders is the loss of a heavyweight that had until now helped rein in the integrationist instincts of Germany and France. Warsaw in particular had welcomed Britain\u2019s insistence that the EU should concentrate on expanding rather than deepening the EU.\n\nOn other points, too, the UK was a valuable friend, supporting the V4 in their desire to keep their age-old enemy Russia in check by continuing with sanctions when other EU members wanted to relax them.\n\nAlready, there appears to be a stuggle to get central European voices heard in the post-Brexit debate. There was fury among V4 members when, the day after the Brexit result was revealed, only the foreign ministers from the EU\u2019s six founding states were invited to Berlin by the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to pledge their support for an \u201cever closer union\u201d. Steinmeier and Jean-Marc Ayrault, his French counterpart, ended the meeting with a petition for a European political union constructed around the euro.\n\nFor countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary that have not adopted the euro \u2013 and say it makes sense to do so only once their citizens\u2019 incomes are higher \u2013 the nightmare scenario is a two-speed Europe in which their interests would be a low priority. \u201cIf Britain had voted to stay in the EU and carved out its own niche with various opt-outs, that would have made an alternative model of EU membership more realistic,\u201d Pawel Swidlicki, a policy analyst at thinktank Open Europe, said. \u201cNow that Britain is leaving, the Visegr\u00e1d Four have to answer some tough questions.\u201d\n\nAcross Europe, distrust of mainstream political parties is on the rise Read more\n\nThe despair that has swept across central European countries as a result of Brexit is most keenly felt in Poland, as one of the EU\u2019s largest countries and soon to be its largest outside the eurozone as well as, crucially, the country with the most citizens living in Britain.\n\nSurveys suggest that Poles still overwhelmingly support EU membership, although they remain divided over what it should mean. Jan Zaleski, 20, a Law and Justice party supporter in Praga, Warsaw, said that, to him, the EU\u2019s scope should be limited to \u201cthe original idea\u2019\u2019 of free trade and free movement of people. \u201cWe didn\u2019t sign up to being governed by Brussels. Nato is there to defend us and the EU is there for trade and to allow us to travel. \u201cWe Poles have been dominated by both Russia and Germany. After all we have been through, we did not go into the EU to be under the thumb of Brussels,\u2019\u2019 said Zaleski, a veterinary student.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Slovak and EU flags near Bratislava castle.

Photograph: Bundas Engler/AP\n\nJuncker and the (Polish) European Council president Donald Tusk are seen by Law and Justice as the architects of a humiliating round of inspections that Warsaw has endured since Law and Justice came to power last October. These have concerned the government\u2019s attempts at bringing Poland\u2019s judiciary to heel, reining in the state media and increasing surveillance powers. For Law and Justice, Tusk is a political enemy. He was a prime minister under the previous Polish government.\n\nPoland has kept its zloty and is still ranked as an emerging market. Without Britain, it fears moves towards a \u201creal EU\u2019\u2019 in which the locomotive is driven by the eurozone. Jacek Kucharczyk, of the Warsaw-based Institute of Public Affairs, said Britain\u2019s departure means the loss to the Polish government of its most important ally in the European parliament. \u201cEven before a British departure, the waning of Britain\u2019s influence means there will be no one to put in a good word for Law and Justice, should the European commission continue its investigation into the state of Polish democracy.\u2019\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the editor-in-chief of Poland\u2019s largest daily, Gazeta Wyborcza, summed up the fear in an editorial: \u201cBrexit is good news for the opponents of European integration, the populists, followers of national egoism, isolationism and xenophobia,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is also good news for Vladimir Putin, who is doing everything to break up the EU and in this way to get dominance over Europe. It is a warning sign for Poles, the vast majority of whom declare themselves to be pro-EU. The only way we can save what is most important \u2013 Poland and Europe \u2013 is to unite against the threats facing European and democratic values.\u201d\n\nIt may be wishful thinking, but among the Visegr\u00e1d Group there is still hope that the US secretary of state, John Kerry, might be right when he suggests the Brexit result could be \u201cwalked back\u201d. Miroslav Laj\u010d\u00e1k previewed his country\u2019s takeup of the EU presidency with the remark: \u201cI would support any measure that will help reverse the position of the British people, which we have to respect but also regret.\u201d The V4\u2019s calls in its truculent statement for more powers to be repatriated to member countries \u2013 a dig at those who want more federalism \u2013 have partly been triggered by countries\u2019 anger over the obligatory quotas forced on them last year for receiving refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. It is in Hungary, under the premiership of authoritarian Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and where anti-immigrant sentiment has been most strongly felt, that the EU\u2019s next nailbiting referendum is due to be held. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s national conservative government is expected to win the vote, scheduled for September, which will ask: \u201cDo you agree that the European Union should have the power to order the forced settlement of non-Hungarians, without Hungary\u2019s national parliament approving it?\u201d\n\nJohn Kerry: Brexit could be 'walked back' Read more\n\nThe referendum is being seen as standing also for a wider demand for EU powers to be to curbed, a call reiterated in an appeal last week by the chairman of the Law and Justice party, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, for a new EU treaty to give back more power to member states. \u201cWe were happy to share the power,\u201d Hungary\u2019s justice minister, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Tr\u00f3cs\u00e1nyi, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper in a recent interview. \u201cBut just as one\u2019s territorial boundaries are not up for debate, neither is the makeup of the population \u2013 it is definitely not something anyone else can decide on.\u201d He said that, because of the decades Hungary was under Soviet rule, it could not be expected to be as willing and able to take in refugees as countries such as Germany and Sweden.\n\nThe strength of anti-EU sentiment in Hungary was illustrated by the decision of the speaker of parliament, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 K\u00f6v\u00e9r, to replace the EU flag, which had hung from the parliament building next to the Hungarian flag, with the flag of the Szekler, a Romania-based Hungarian minority. The nationalist gesture was popularly received.\n\nBrexit could start a disastrous EU drift to the east | Andras Schweitzer Read more\n\nIn a sign of just how highly he regarded Britain as an EU partner, Orb\u00e1n placed a whole-page advert in the Daily Mail ahead of the referendum stating his support for remain. At the same time he took the opportunity to heap praise, when speaking to his own people, on Britons\u2019 decision to take back their sovereignty and protect their national rights.\n\nThe V4 may have lost its closest ally and protector, but in many ways its members have never felt bolder than they do now to call for exactly what they want from the Brussels executive.\n\nDespite the region\u2019s Euroscepticism, its suffering during the cold war has done much to secure an intrinsic support for the EU among the V4. The dramatic changes the region has undergone mean they are more pragmatic regarding reform, claim V4 leaders, adding that the EU would do well to recognise that by giving them greater voting powers. But in the current mood of retrenchment and hunkering down in Brussels, that might be a hard argument to sell.\n\nFico, Slovakia\u2019s Eurosceptic left-wing prime minister, may have considered his recent triple heart bypass to have been his biggest problem. Now, with all eyes on Slovakia\u2019s presidency, it is more likely to be the challenge he faces to set a bruised EU on the path of reform. Nevertheless, as the prospect of Brexit sinks in, he is determined: \u201cIf somebody thinks that after Brexit we can offer to the European people what we give them now, they are wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Philip Oltermann and Alex Duval Smith", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/06/04/Kate_Connolly,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=229e118186855645212769324f29a11d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff508bdfd1931de201c02a8df6d0f7406d08e728/0_0_4256_2820/master/4256.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6c19d4d9f4c29a0ad3135819c75a9953", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CBrexit%2CEurope%2CPoland%2CHungary%2CSlovakia%2CCzech+Republic%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CMigration%2CVladimir+Putin", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff508bdfd1931de201c02a8df6d0f7406d08e728/0_237_4256_2555/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=09b9b41dfa1802e52f526166307c2a02", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3d59bebd9ebf4fc55bfedd9b5217be4d03df5b6/0_254_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=005fabda566fb99af45dbf133ce36e40", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff508bdfd1931de201c02a8df6d0f7406d08e728/0_237_4256_2555/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=09b9b41dfa1802e52f526166307c2a02", "date": "22/07/2016"}, "rank_12": {"title": "Continental Drift review \u2013 the rise of Euroscepticism", "text": "Since June\u2019s shock referendum result, Brexit has removed a Tory prime minister, and threatens to split the Labour party. Political news has become addictive to a degree unheard of since those fevered weeks in November 1990 when Margaret Thatcher\u2019s long regime was brought to an end in an internal Tory putsch. The coup\u2019s primary provocation was Thatcher\u2019s surly attitude to Europe \u2013 and to her deputy prime minister, the Europhile Geoffrey Howe. Back then Howe was closely aligned with Thatcher\u2019s former chancellor Nigel Lawson, who has since reinvented himself as a bullish Brexiter. Labour\u2019s current travails also remind us of its own internal differences over Europe. In 1981 Labour\u2019s hostility to Europe precipitated the breakaway of the \u201cgang of four\u201d \u2013 Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams, David Owen and Bill Rodgers \u2013 to form the Social Democratic party. Curiously, like Lawson, Owen too is now a convert to Brexit, as is Jim Sillars, the architect of the SNP\u2019s successful \u201cindependence in Europe\u201d policy. Europe has split parties, ruined political careers and prompted strange Damascene conversions; what it has not done until now is fan the interest of the British public.\n\nTurnout in the UK for elections to the European parliament has rarely risen above 35%. Why has something so seemingly peripheral to mainstream British politics brought about so much disruption? Benjamin Grob-Fitzgibbon, a diplomat in the US State Department and former academic, brings an outsider\u2019s perspective to our squabbles. He emphasises the ways in which the empire and Commonwealth influenced Britain\u2019s relationship with the European project. But his findings will dismay cod-Churchillian Brexiters.\n\nThis is because Winston Churchill emerges from these pages as the champion of a \u201cUnited States of Europe\u201d, a formulation that he first used in 1938 and returned to in opposition, after the war. Churchill\u2019s confident leadership of the United Europe movement \u2013 confidence derived from Britain\u2019s imperial standing \u2013 paved the way for the establishment of the Council of Europe in 1949, with British participation. Grob-Fitzgibbon is persuasively insistent that imperial commitments did not run counter to European ideals, but, surprising as it may seem, underpinned them. In the late 40s Churchill understood that Britain was pulled in different directions, by its empire, by the Atlantic alliance, and by the imperative to rebuild European civilisation on durable foundations. Yet these various demanding commitments were complementary. For \u201cimperial Europeans\u201d in the Conservative party, such as Churchill, Julian Amery, Duncan Sandys and Harold Macmillan, it was obvious that European renewal called for globally engaged leadership. Colonial possessions did not in themselves provide a structural impediment to European integration, quite the reverse. After all, France had its own overseas empire, and it was to these two global powers that the leadership of Europe must inevitably fall. In the immediate postwar era Labour\u2019s foreign secretary, the pragmatic trade unionist Ernest Bevin, shared some of these broad assumptions, though with some scepticism about Churchill\u2019s plans for a European Assembly. Bevin\u2019s own vision of a \u201cWestern Union\u201d \u2013 a sphere of industrial and military cooperation in western Europe \u2013 was also an imperial one, drawing on the resources of Britain\u2019s colonies and dominions.\n\nHowever, according to Grob-Fitzgibbon, British leadership of the European project evaporated in the spring of 1950. The fraught circumstances of the Berlin airlift in 1948-9 had convinced Bevin that western European cooperation was insufficient in itself, and required the external support of the US. Discerning British hesitancy, Jean Monnet, one of the architects of European integration, abandoned his existing vision of Anglo-French leadership and plumped instead for a Franco-German project. The result, rapidly formulated, was the Schuman plan for a joint authority superintending Franco-German coal and steel production. Although Churchill and the Daily Mail \u2013 then fervently Europhile \u2013 were enthusiastic about the Schuman plan, Bevin was lukewarm.\n\nAll was not lost. Churchill\u2019s government of 1951-5 promised to be the most Europhile in British history, except for the foreign secretary, Anthony Eden, who, while happy to use pro-European rhetoric from time to time, was much less enthusiastic about the prospects for a European army. Nevertheless, the vision of Anglo-French partnership remained alive, for a while. Eden himself, as Churchill\u2019s successor, orchestrated the calamitous collusion between the two powers at Suez in 1956. Under intense economic pressure from the US, Eden unilaterally decided upon a ceasefire, without consulting his French allies.\n\nThe six members (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg) of the European Coal and Steel Community had already met at Messina in 1955 to plan a common market, which was launched in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome as the European Economic Community (EEC). But as far as Britain\u2019s swaggering \u201cimperial Europeans\u201d were concerned this was still \u201cLittle Europe\u201d. There was room for something bolder and more comprehensive. In 1959 Britain, along with Sweden, played a leading role in establishing the European Free Trade Association, which also included Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria. Nevertheless, the UK did not envisage the Efta seven as a long-term rival to the EEC six so much as a stepping stone for membership of the common market.\n\nHowever, the aftershocks of Suez lingered. French president Charles de Gaulle never forgot that Britain\u2019s primary relationship was with the US, and twice during the 1960s blocked British applications to join the EEC \u2013 first from Harold Macmillan\u2019s Tory government, and then from Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson. Yet De Gaulle \u2013 ironically \u2013 was no fan of EEC-style integration, preferring instead a looser, anti-federalist \u201cEurope des patries\u201d. As Macmillan confided to his diary, \u201cDe Gaulle wants the kind of Europe that we would be able readily to join, but he doesn\u2019t want us in it.\u201d\n\nMacmillan\u2019s application to join the EEC clarified Labour opposition to it. Hugh Gaitskell, James Callaghan and Douglas Jay favoured an outward-looking internationalism based on a global, multi-racial Commonwealth. The EEC they regarded as a sinister capitalist plot to stymie socialism. By the mid-60s, a stark division appeared to prevail between a pro-Commonwealth Labour government faced by a Conservative opposition, led by Ted Heath, which was committed to EEC entry. But the appeal of the Commonwealth \u2013 an increasingly fanciful panacea for Britain\u2019s economic woes \u2013 waned, and in 1967 Wilson\u2019s Labour government submitted its own application to join the EEC, which was promptly vetoed by France.\n\nWith the demise of De Gaulle, Britain under Heath was at last admitted in 1973. However, the legislation paving the way for entry was only achieved with the help of 69 pro-European Labour MPs who defied their own party whip to support the government. For, with the passing of empire and the outward-looking confidence it engendered, the Tory backbenches had seen the first stirrings of Eurosceptic rebellion. In 1975 Wilson \u2013 crafty, cynical and competent \u2013 suppressed some of Labour\u2019s divisions with a referendum on Europe in which collective cabinet responsibility was temporarily suspended to allow ministers to campaign on either side. With the steady support of prominent Euro-agnostics \u2013 most notably Callaghan, by then Labour\u2019s foreign secretary, and Thatcher, the new leader of the Tory party \u2013 Wilson achieved his intended result: a 67% vote to stay in, which decisively confirmed British membership of the EEC.\n\nA few minor errors notwithstanding, Grob-Fitzgibbon has produced an absorbing account of our current predicament. He interprets the Euroscepticism of the last few decades as a post-imperial condition, in which the longing for a lost greatness is so desperate that it grossly distorts the objects of nostalgia. But all of us, remainers as well as Eurosceptics, have lazily bought into the dominant narrative. A zesty and ingenious Remain campaign \u2013 of the sort we conspicuously lacked \u2013 might have presented the Europhile Churchill as a patriotic anti-Brexit icon. Alas, a truth that defies popular cliche would have sunk at the first focus group.\n\n\u2022 To order Continental Drift for \u00a324.99 go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Even though he thinks that is likely to happen, he thinks it more important that we stay outside the EU \u2013 I think that is a deep, deep mistake.\u201d\n\n\n\nSmith, who is trailing well behind in the polls, hopes that a pledge for Labour to take Britain back into the EU will appeal to pro-European Labour members and boost his chances.\n\n\n\nOwen Smith was rash in proposing talks with Isis | Richard English Read more\n\n\u201cWe should be fighting harder, why can\u2019t you say you would fight to stay in?\u201d he shouted.\n\n\n\nCorbyn responded: \u201cThe referendum took place, the result is there, we know the Tory agenda.\u201d He said he would fight for an economic relationship with Europe, protections for workers, the environment and trading relationships with other countries that did not echo the US-EU trade deal, known as TTIP, that he strongly opposes.\n\n\n\nCorbyn admitted to some Euroscepticism, saying the EU had weaknesses including pushing countries to privatise their railways. \u201cBut we have to recognise there were some problems before the referendum with the EU ... There is an agenda in Europe which is not something Labour would support which is the free market agenda.\u201d\n\n\n\nSupporters took to social media to argue that Corbyn was more likely to attract voters in working class heartlands with his position on the EU.\n\n\n\nThe two contenders \u2013 who appeared to agree on most domestic policies \u2013 also clashed over a question on Nato during an official hustings in Solihull, in the West Midlands.\n\nAsked how he would respond to military aggression by Vladimir Putin toward a Nato member, Corbyn suggested that he would not intervene militarily in line with the agreement between countries in the grouping.\n\nThe Labour leader said. \u201cWe cannot allow a military buildup which could be calamitous. I would want to avoid us getting involved in military. I don\u2019t wish to go to war \u2013 what I want to do is achieve a world that we don\u2019t need to go to war.\u201d\n\nThe comments triggered an angry response from some Labour MPs. Ilford North\u2019s MP, Wes Streeting, said the public would conclude he was \u201cunfit to hold the office of prime minister\u201d if he refused to uphold the Nato of principle of mutual defence. \u201cIt is a gross betrayal of Labour\u2019s internationalist values,\u201d he told the PoliticsHome website.\n\n\u201cThe only other significant politician to be so reckless and cavalier about the future of Nato is Donald Trump. They are different sides of the same coin: thoughtless and irresponsible.\u201d\n\nSmith said: \u201cWe would have to come to the aid of a fellow member of Nato, that is the nature of the Nato accord.\u201d However, he said that it would be calamitous to get to that stage and argued diplomacy would have to be used to try to avoid it. Smith again argued that membership of the EU would help in this area.\n\nBut the Welsh MP was heckled and jeered when he claimed that 170 Labour MPs who voted no confidence in Corbyn were \u201csocialist\u201d \u2013 causing the host, ITV\u2019s Carl Dinnen, to intervene. One audience member shouted \u201ctraitor\u201d, while others also expressed anger at Smith and other politicians who had caused the leadership contest.\n\nSmith defended his claim that Britain should be willing to negotiate with Isis. \u201cI said yesterday there was no prospect of negotiating with IS [Isis] \u2013 we should never negotiate with terrorists when they are maiming and bombing. And the chances are we will never end up negotiating with IS. They are nihilistic and they are seeking to destroy people,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he argued that if they ever did renounce violence, negotiations could take place as they had in Northern Ireland with people who had \u201ccommitted murder and terrorism\u201d.\n\nThe pair also put forward policy ideas, with Smith flirting with the idea of reducing VAT by 5p.

The pessimists \u2013 the majority \u2013 saw Brexit as a huge threat. A British vote to leave would strengthen \u201ccentrifugal forces\u201d and could even be the beginning of the end of the EU. The optimists \u2013 the minority \u2013 saw it as an opportunity. The shock of Brexit could galvanise the EU to move ahead with further integration, especially in areas that the UK had blocked. But both optimists and pessimists agreed that, if the UK did actually vote to leave, the EU would need to respond.\n\nTwo months on from the referendum, however, little has happened beyond declarations of commitment to the future of the European project. The reason for this odd period of apparent inactivity is not just the lull caused by the summer break or even the shock of the British vote to leave the EU. It is also that, although everybody in Europe seems to agree that something must be done to respond to the Brexit vote, no one can seem to agree on what.\n\nGerman politicians are aware that expectations have increased, but so have fears of German power\n\nWhile Europeans have watched the chaos that has been British politics over the last two months and waited for the new government to decide what it wanted, there have been plenty of exhortations to see Brexit as a wake-up call. But what Europeans are supposed to do if and when they wake up is less clear. Many among Europe\u2019s great and good have urged a new focus on the \u201cessentials\u201d, what is being called the \u201cEurope of necessity\u201d. The EU must deliver for citizens,but how?\n\nFar from lurching towards the superstate that British Eurosceptics always feared, the reality is that the EU is paralysed by the multiple intersecting fault lines that already existed within it \u2013 between creditor and debtor countries, between old and new member states and between left and right. This matters for the UK because its negotiation about a new relationship with the EU will be linked to the parallel deals between Europeans on the other areas that matter most to them, in particular economic policy and refugee policy.\n\nAt the centre of all this, geographically and politically, is Germany. The Brexit vote has thrust Berlin into an even more pivotal position \u2013 the future of the EU will now revolve even more tightly around Germany. German politicians are aware that expectations have increased, but so have fears of German power. German politicians talk about \u201cleading from the centre\u201d, in other words, to drive policy but to do so by seeking to find a European consensus.\n\nWhat this means in practice is a kind of hub-and-spoke Europe in which diplomacy, bilaterally and in groups, centres on Berlin. It began, disastrously, when the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, invited the foreign ministers of the six founding member states of the EU to Berlin the weekend after the referendum. The meeting was meant to be a show of European unity but inevitably alienated other member states.\n\nSince then, Angela Merkel and Steinmeier have met other European leaders to prepare for the post-Brexit summit that will take place in Bratislava on 16 September. Tomorrow, the Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, will host Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, on Ventotene, an island off Naples where, in 1941, two interned anti-fascist activists wrote a famous manifesto calling for a federation of European states.\n\nHowever, despite all this diplomatic activity centred on Berlin, there is unlikely to be much progress by the time of the summit on the two biggest challenges for the EU: the eurozone and the refugee crisis. In both cases, the differences, roughly, between north and south in the eurozone and east and west on the refugee crisis, remain as wide as ever. If any initiatives are announced in Bratislava, they are likely to be in other less divisive areas such as better co-operation on counter-terrorism and perhaps some small steps in integrating European security and defence policy.\n\nThe problem is that this is unlikely to do much to stop the rise of Euroscepticism, which most recognise is not an exclusively British phenomenon, even if it is more extreme here. \u201cWe must acknowledge that support and passion for our common project has faded over the last decade in parts of our societies,\u201d wrote Steinmeier and the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, in a joint paper published shortly after the referendum.\n\nWhat some see as a necessary response to Euroscepticism, others see as a capitulation to it. For Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and president of the Liberal group in the European parliament, the lesson of David Cameron\u2019s failure to persuade the British population to remain in the EU was that \u201cone cannot defeat nationalism by pandering to nationalists\u201d. The solution is \u201cmore Europe\u201d.\n\nFrauke Petry: the acceptable face of Germany\u2019s new right? Read more\n\nOthers see calls to transfer more sovereignty to Brussels as part of the problem rather than the solution. \u201cNeither a simple call for more Europe nor a phase of mere reflection can be an adequate answer,\u201d Ayrault and Steinmeier wrote in their paper. Some, including the Dutch and Polish government, are more interested in devolving power back to the member states.\n\nIt is also almost universally recognised that ways must be found to better legitimate European integration. But this is another mere aspiration. While some want a tighter EU centred on the eurozone, with its own parliament, others want a looser EU based on the idea of \u201cvariable geometry\u201d in which national parliaments would play a greater role.\n\nFor the first time in the history of European integration, Germany is putting the brakes on. The shift is exemplified by the transformation in the attitude of the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, since his tough treatment of Greece last summer, the most popular politician in Germany. Sch\u00e4uble is generally seen as the most \u201cpro-European\u201d member of Merkel\u2019s cabinet. But even before the referendum, he said in an interview with Der Spiegel that the EU couldn\u2019t simply react to a British vote to leave the EU with a call for more integration.\n\nGerman officials increasingly justify positions such as this on the basis of the need for a European consensus \u2013 it must occupy a middle ground between different member states. But this is typically disingenuous. In reality, there is national politics behind Germany\u2019s opposition to further integration. Euroscepticism is rising in Germany too, not just among voters who are drifting to the Eurosceptic Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party but also in bastions of the establishment such as the Bundesbank and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.\n\nThe reality is that while an overwhelming majority of Germans remain committed to the EU, many no longer see further integration as being in the national interest. When France and Italy talk about more \u201crisk sharing\u201d in the eurozone, Germans see this as a stealth attempt to the \u201ctransfer union\u201d \u2013 in other words, an EU in which the fiscally responsible subsidise the fiscally irresponsible \u2013 that they have always feared. With a presidential election in France and a general election in Germany in 2017, positions are likely to harden over the next 12 months.\n\nThis may all seem like the kind of arcane drama from which Britain voted on 23 June to liberate itself. But whether Britons like it or not, it will inform the way the EU negotiates with the UK. Behind the European commission\u2019s negotiating position will be member states concerned about Euroscepticism at home. It is the fear of empowering the Front National in France and the AfD in Germany, rather than a desire to \u201cpunish\u201d Britain, which is behind the reluctance to give the UK the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d that it wants. There may also be implicit trade-offs between member states linking the negotiation with the UK and negotiations in other areas.\n\nChancellor Merkel seems, for now, to have prevailed with her patient approach to Brexit; as the reality set in that there was nothing anyone could do to make the UK invoke article 50, the calls for the UK to \u201cgo quickly\u201d largely stopped. Informal negotiations even seem to be taking place despite the initial Brussels mantra of \u201cno negotiation before notification\u201d.\n\nBut two months on from the referendum, the answer to the big question \u2013 will the UK be able to negotiate access to the single market, particularly for services, while restricting immigration from the EU? \u2013 remains unclear. Last week, Germany\u2019s European affairs minister indicated Britain could be given a \u201cspecial status\u201d. To British ears, that might sound like the best of both worlds \u2013 perhaps the access to the single market that comes with EEA membership together with the ability to restrict immigration that comes with a looser trade agreement. Whether that turns out to be wishful thinking will depend on the domestic political pressures on Europe\u2019s leaders and the negotiation between them about the future of the EU \u201cat 27\u201d.\n\nHans Kundnani is senior transatlantic fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, based in Berlin.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e7459b3e981ca7a8c710ed5822fceae49353e56/79_0_1565_939/master/1565.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c79cb2ce432887f06343b5e3f50940b2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f724868025d134753610e30ef7b51e836e72a9e/0_140_4500_2701/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ef0a94bddc32e9ab0df3490c43a31c7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aef0ec5365e2cd4aae9ad907799a64450a054c5/0_56_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ca9942a0ece239e41c4c0f98ec0e8210", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aef0ec5365e2cd4aae9ad907799a64450a054c5/0_56_4096_2459/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aa2d93cda8f5a05eaf725f5959f360e2", "https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Anne_McElvoy,_L.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CGermany%2CFrance%2CEurope%2CPolitics%2CUK+news", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7bebd9305a94347cb51c68c700547aa030cb17/0_0_2362_1417/2362.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc302b4a5f75f572ab51bb97dec4b943"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aef0ec5365e2cd4aae9ad907799a64450a054c5/0_56_4096_2459/4096.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=aa2d93cda8f5a05eaf725f5959f360e2", "date": "21/08/2016"}, "rank_19": {"title": "Euroscepticism\u2019s middle-aged spread isn\u2019t confined to the UK | Anne McElvoy", "text": "The EU is acquiring a midlife crisis.

Yet a look at attitudes in the main EU countries shows that there is more going on than the portrayal of Britons as an awkward squad of thankless Europeans.\n\nIn the 1990s, as a correspondent in Berlin, I watched the rise of the new EU from the rubble of the Berlin Wall; the Franco-German project to lead a stable and prosperous Europe commanded deep support. But a mixture of eurozone tensions, migration worries and decline in esteem for the EU has brought on malaise. France is our closest kin in this regard. According to a survey of attitudes in 10 large European countries by the Pew Research Centre, only a third of mid-lifers there (aged 35-49) viewed the EU favourably \u2013 not far behind the over-50s in grumpiness about the institution. Across well-off northern Europe, it is those in mid-career and in their child-rearing years who are most likely to feel lacklustre. In the Netherlands only half of the middle-agers describe themselves as positive about the EU, as opposed to three-fifths of the 18- to 34-year-olds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018In the 1990s, as a correspondent in Berlin, I watched the rise of the new EU from the rubble of the Berlin Wall.\u2019 Photograph: Rex Features\n\nGermany too has tilted \u2013 not in quite so sulky a direction as France, it is true, but one in which the affinity that both elites and the wider population have for the EU as an ideal looks far more loosely woven than it was.\n\nTrue, there is still a lot of a \u201cWhat on earth have you done?\u2019\u201d in the air after June.

I remember an exuberant Die Zeit front page about Germany and Europe after unification that read: \u201cThere never was such a new beginning!\u201d That is precisely the sense of possibility today\u2019s Europe lacks. Now there is yet another sign of that widespread demographic divorce between young and middle-aged: three-fifths of young Germans in the Pew research are positive about the EU, but barely a half of those in their late 30s and 40s.\n\nIf rich Europe is dyspeptic, what about Greece and Spain, the southern \u201cproblem children\u201d? The latter, once fiercely pro-EU, now has just under 50% of mid-lifers onside. Austerity-stricken Greece sees no big difference in the overwhelmingly negative views of the mid-lifers and the over-50s. Italy and Sweden would have to be the holiday destination for the European Movement \u2013 and they are rarities in having relatively good ratings among the middle generation; while Poles and Hungarians are positive about the EU in all age groups (despite an increasingly chauvinistic Hungarian government that has made handling the migrant crisis much harder by erecting its own Great Wall of Europe). But the EU cannot base a revival only on poorer countries or new entrants clinging to it, often as respite from erratic governance at home.\n\nTo draw lessons from the UK referendum requires a cool look at the claims about who voted for what. \u201cYoung people voted to remain by a considerable margin, but were outvoted,\u201d the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, told the Guardian. Martin Schulz, the German president of the European parliament, feels for \u201cfuture generations\u201d who voted to remain. In fact the results for Britain\u2019s midlife group were one of the bigger problems for remain. Its votes \u2013 just a few percentage points over the halfway mark to stay in \u2013 were too scanty a layer of insulation to see off leave. A higher turnout in the youngest demographic would only have fought leave to a score draw.\n\nEngland 1-2 Iceland: the internet reacts to another humiliating exit from Europe Read more\n\nPeople will differ about why, but a few thoughts that struck me as key were that the faith in economic arguments began to fall and kept on falling, because remain did not have another confident argument up its sleeve. Duncan Smith told us that cabinet discussions on the prime minister\u2019s strategy before the campaign showed him \u201cready to unleash the beasts of economic uncertainty\u201d.

Johnson reflects the unease that centre-left politicians have of engaging in immigration \u2013 a subject that had caused them difficulty form the Blair years onwards. It might also be telling that Straw, speaking for a younger generation of pro-European campaigners, was keener on arguing about immigration than was the elder statesmen of Labour or the government.\n\nWhat finally won it for leave? \u201cA coalition of the blue collar and the golf club,\u201d says Ashdown \u2013 a statement we can argue about down at the 19th hole, or if you can find workers still in blue collars. But this was a vote in which the predictions, the experts and the big machinery of state backed one outcome and got another. That\u2019s a lesson for Europe that resonates far beyond perfidious Blighty.\n\n\u2022 Anne McElvoy\u2018s How We Voted Brexit is on Radio 4 at 8pm on Tuesday (August 23)", "images": ["https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/10/06/Joseph-Stiglitz,-L.png", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d56310fe4b3700c8f9ab3a8bdb1a3bc37b737d/0_72_5426_3256/master/5426.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c81350fae36d5aa09fceff6e7d1bddfb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c919de6f5b8e0dbaa8897b0b23b35767adcd2cc/0_166_4992_2995/4992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dc783c811b0ea83716fe3bba33a17c1b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e7459b3e981ca7a8c710ed5822fceae49353e56/79_0_1565_939/master/1565.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c79cb2ce432887f06343b5e3f50940b2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f724868025d134753610e30ef7b51e836e72a9e/0_140_4500_2701/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ef0a94bddc32e9ab0df3490c43a31c7", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c919de6f5b8e0dbaa8897b0b23b35767adcd2cc/0_166_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=43201950009fbf6375c497c0271d7496", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Anne_McElvoy,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fd3205e9c9108e916c600325d1931015", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d7bebd9305a94347cb51c68c700547aa030cb17/0_0_2362_1417/2362.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc302b4a5f75f572ab51bb97dec4b943", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CBrexit%2CFrance%2CGermany%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CEurope%2CWorld+news"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c919de6f5b8e0dbaa8897b0b23b35767adcd2cc/0_166_4992_2995/4992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=dc783c811b0ea83716fe3bba33a17c1b", "date": "23/08/2016"}, "rank_130": {"title": "The Guardian view on Ukip: after Brexit, what\u2019s the meaning of life? | Editorial", "text": "All political parties contain contradictions, but few are as confused about their purpose as Ukip. The party was founded in opposition to European integration and evolved into a less coherent nationalistic protest movement. On that journey, hostility towards \u201cBrussels\u201d has served as a sanitising agent, lending mainstream propriety to an organisation in which anxiety about a loss of identity sometimes merges with outright racism. The adhesive quality of Euroscepticism is weaker now that Britain has a prime minister committed to Brexit. It is far from clear that Diane James, Ukip\u2019s new leader, is capable of restoring the insurgent energy that gave the party such momentum in the pre-referendum years.\n\nUkip elects Diane James as new party leader Read more\n\nMs James ran a cautious campaign, eschewing policy and avoiding debate. In presentational terms she was the slickest candidate; she appealed to members who want a more professional organisation. Nigel Farage shared but never achieved that objective, partly because of his narcissistic character and partly because of the nature of the movement he had built. Beyond the European question, there is a tension in Ukip between an ambition to be respectable and a wilful embrace of maverick identity that rejects \u201cestablishment\u201d notions of respectability. This problem was encapsulated in Mr Farage\u2019s problematic relationship with parliament, denouncing it as a den of corruption while desperately trying to win a seat there. The Faragist platform resonated widely enough to give Ukip a double-digit share of the national vote without ever electing him an MP.\n\nThat is a technical obstacle of the Westminster voting system, but it expresses also Mr Farage\u2019s failure to reassure mainstream voters that his claims to abhor racism were sincere. Ukip\u2019s only MP, Douglas Carswell, first won his seat when badged as a Tory, and he espouses an internationalist libertarianism that can share a tent with Ukip\u2019s anti-immigration, nativist tendency only if both sides agree to pretend they are compatible. That pretence is breaking down. Mr Carswell would look more at home rejoining the Conservatives. He is not alone. Alexandra Phillips, Ukip\u2019s former head of media, told the Guardian today that she has joined the Tories and claimed that tens of thousands of Ukip members had done the same. Mrs May\u2019s commitment to Brexit, grammar schools and immigration control appear to have made her party once again a natural home for those who defected to Ukip in horror at David Cameron\u2019s dalliances with more liberal conservatism.\n\nEven before the Brexit vote, Mr Farage said that his party had reached the limits of growth available by recruiting disgruntled Tories. He envisaged future advances being made in Labour seats in the Midlands, the north of England and Wales. Many Labour MPs, witnessing the receptivity of their core voters to anti-EU messages during the referendum campaign, fear a challenge from Ukip could trigger a collapse of their heartland support. Ms James inherits an organisational shambles where the leading figures hate one another. Her first move was to stop the party\u2019s leader in Wales, the ex-Tory MP Neil Hamilton, from addressing conference. She has the notional support of Mr Farage, but only after his first-choice candidate, immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe, was excluded from the ballot on technical grounds that supporters believe were trumped up and motivated by factional spite. The outgoing leader may not relinquish the limelight to which he has become so obviously addicted.\n\nAnyone who judges Ukip\u2019s influence in British politics to have been pernicious \u2013 laundering xenophobia with the ideological detergent of Euroscepticism \u2013 may enjoy seeing it consumed by factional bickering. But institutional malaise must not be confused with abeyance of the force Ukip represented. Brexit cannot satisfy many of those who voted to leave the EU because EU membership was not the root of their dissatisfaction. The drivers of Faragism \u2013 economic insecurity and disorientation connected to the pace of globalisation \u2013 will remain. The capacity of Mrs May\u2019s government to address them while bogged down in complex European negotiations, will be limited. A period of Ukip disarray still creates an opportunity for the Tories and Labour to reconnect with disillusioned supporters who have been lending protest votes to Ukip. That will not be easy, but the moment must be seized quickly. It may not last long.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=UK+Independence+party+%28Ukip%29%2CPolitics%2CNigel+Farage%2CDouglas+Carswell%2CConservatives%2CTheresa+May%2CBrexit%2CUK+news%2CDiane+James", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b79f6c07877d9a5ffd21f549d37598aab93b25d/206_258_2947_1768/master/2947.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60a22393b6bc38b527a1d45f9d5395be", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b79f6c07877d9a5ffd21f549d37598aab93b25d/206_258_2947_1768/2947.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bffa73971e9c596dd090446d480a6063"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b79f6c07877d9a5ffd21f549d37598aab93b25d/206_258_2947_1768/2947.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bffa73971e9c596dd090446d480a6063", "date": "16/09/2016"}, "rank_87": {"title": "The man who brought you Brexit | Sam Knight", "text": "Until about nine months ago, leaving the European Union was not something that sensible British politicians talked about. They hadn\u2019t, really, since the country entered the bloc in 1973, the year that Theresa May sat her O-levels. In the intervening 43 years, as the EEC became the EU; and Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair came and went; and the Channel Tunnel was dug; and the borders spread to the east; and the euro was launched, and then foundered; our relationship with Brussels seemed, more or less, to embody a settled ambivalence towards the European continent that most British people instinctively recognised as their own. Close, but separate. In, but not integrated. Related, but not the same. We did not learn French.\n\nAnd then 17 million people voted to leave. Everyone has their own explanation for why. Not all of them make sense. I found out the other day that my wife\u2019s uncle voted for Brexit because his son is training to be a doctor, and doesn\u2019t like Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned for remain. Victory, as they say, has many fathers. Since 23 June, a great many things have been blamed \u2013 or thanked, depending on your view \u2013 for convincing the population that staying within the European Union was hurting us. Their names are more than familiar now. Nigel Farage. Globalisation. The rightwing press. The left behind. Professional politicians. Absent politicians. The financial crisis. Boris. Migrants. Project Fear. Sunderland. In their own way, and over time, these things helped create the feeling that we were trapped in something so defective, so inimical to our interests, that our best hope was to climb through a high window, and out.\n\nBut you don\u2019t get to Brexit without someone dreaming up the window \u2013 the remedy of leaving \u2013 in the first place. And during those long years inside the European project, that was the work of the right wing of the Conservative party. To be specific, a small, somewhat esoteric part of that wing: a flash of feathers, almost, a sect of true Eurosceptic believers who dreamed and schemed for this moment for the last 25 years. Most worked for little else, with no reward, and with no sign that they would ever prevail. \u201cLike the monks on Iona,\u201d as one of their former parliamentary researchers told me, \u201cilluminating their manuscripts and waiting for the Dark Ages to come to an end.\u201d\n\nAnd no one in that group worked with more devotion than Daniel Hannan, a Conservative member of the European parliament for south-east England. Hannan, who is 45, is by no ordinary measure a front-rank British politician. He has never been an MP, or a minister, or a mayor. Instead, since the age of 19, he has fought for what he calls British independence \u2013 fomenting, protesting, strategising, undermining, writing books, writing speeches and then delivering them without notes. For the last 17 years, Hannan, a spry, fastidious figure, who likes to read Shakespeare once a week, has done this mainly from the other side of the English Channel. He knows what it is to toil for a lost cause. \u201cHere I am, Ishmael,\u201d he told me recently, in his office at the European parliament in Strasbourg, invoking the Old Testament as he gestured around him. \u201cEvery man\u2019s hand is against me.\u201d\n\nHannan may have contributed more to the ideas, arguments and tactics of Euroscepticism than any other individual. It was Hannan, in 2012, who asked Matthew Elliott, the founder of the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, to set up the embryonic campaign group that later became Vote Leave. Elliott, who is 38, describes Hannan as the pamphleteer who made Brexit seem like a reasonable proposition for millions of people. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anybody who has done more on this,\u201d he told me. Others laboured too, of course, and Elliott cited veteran Tory MPs Bill Cash and John Redwood, who spent decades attacking the constitutional and economic aspects of the EU \u2013 \u201cbut Dan is the only person who has successfully created a whole worldview,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also then done better than anyone else to be the propagandist for it.\u201d\n\nMembership Event: The Long Read live at the Hospital Club\n\nHannan\u2019s signature case against EU membership is an upbeat argument of direct democracy and free-market capitalism. He sidesteps questions about the inevitable trade-offs of leaving by insisting there will be none. Elliott was an intern when he first heard Hannan speak in Westminster almost 20 years ago. Douglas Carswell, the Ukip MP, was convinced by Hannan that Britain should pull out, in the autumn of 1993. \u201cWhen I heard Boris Johnson and all those others making those brilliant points they made,\u201d Carswell told me recently, \u201cI thought, \u2018Compare it to making a film: these guys on the silver screen are brilliant. But the script is written by Hannan, and this is largely a Hannan production.\u2019\u201d Theresa Villiers, the former Northern Ireland secretary, who helped persuade David Cameron to allow his cabinet to campaign freely during the vote, was \u201cradicalised\u201d, in her phrase, by Hannan during her time as an MEP. \u201cOn the morning of 24 June, I texted Dan congratulating him on changing the course of European history.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Hannan is not a household name. He didn\u2019t break out during the campaign. Fellow Brexiteers told me there were prosaic reasons for this. \u201cThe broadcasters had their own hierarchy for their own reasons,\u201d said Michael Gove. \u201cThey took the view that some people were box-office and some people weren\u2019t.\u201d Besides, to allies and enemies alike, Hannan\u2019s role has never been on centre stage. Trying to characterise his contribution to Brexit, many people I spoke to likened him to dogmatic intellectuals from the past who came first and prepared the way. Admirers mentioned Patrick Henry and Tom Paine, whose writings catalysed the American Revolution. Opponents compared Hannan to Trotsky. \u201cYou have got to have hard arses,\u201d the Marquess of Salisbury, a long-term Eurosceptic and Hannan supporter, told me, \u201cwho are morally courageous, who consistently make the arguments, who don\u2019t mind being unfashionable.\u201d\n\nIn his own way, he is an idiot savant. So locked up in his world, he can\u2019t see what's on the end of his aquiline nose Gawain Towler\n\nThe other explanation, however, is that in the climactic moment \u2013 when Brexit was put to the people \u2013 it wasn\u2019t Hannan and his debating points that carried Britain out of the European Union, but a smaller, darker, set of instincts altogether. The final weeks of the Vote Leave campaign, with its focus on immigration and posters about Turkey joining the EU, were like nothing out of a sonorous Hannan speech. (His own 217-page book, Why Vote Leave, contains a single sentence on immigration, and Hannan supports Turkish membership of the bloc, in principle.) In the eyes of Ukip, the narrow, Hannanite case for Brexit \u2013 mostly about deregulation and sovereignty \u2013 was a sideshow next to the real event: a chorus of economic and cultural discontent. \u201cIn his own way, he is an idiot savant,\u201d said Gawain Towler, Nigel Farage\u2019s spokesman. \u201cSo locked up in his world that he can\u2019t see what is on the end of his well-formed aquiline nose.\u201d\n\nHannan himself is almost impossible to pin down on these questions. He is agile and skilful when he talks \u2013 like a star witness with absolutely nothing to hide \u2013 and during several conversations this summer, he showed no anxiety at all about the manner of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU, or the scale of the diplomatic and economic challenges facing the country. Whenever he could, Hannan would muse on the fair-mindedness and natural intelligence of the British people, and spar with the ideas of his many opponents. \u201cIf you\u2019re told that \u2018Brexit was all about immigration,\u2019 you can be almost certain that you\u2019re talking to a Remain voter,\u201d ran a sample, recent tweet.\n\nFor the rest of us, the patience and ruthlessness of the long-term leavers \u2013 a tiny band, fiddling at the political margins for a quarter of a century \u2013 will always be a breathtaking thing. \u201cIt\u2019s revenge of the nerd,\u201d one current cabinet minister, who voted remain, told me. \u201cI was in awe of it.\u201d But he observed that in all the years of plotting, there had been scant planning for the part that comes next, and no guarantee the agitation will now stop. \u201cNone of these people are builders, they are destroyers,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThey are frightening people. They are like arsonists.\u201d If Hannan has ever felt a moment of fear, or doubt, about his life\u2019s work, you suspect that he will never admit it, even to himself. His term as an MEP runs out in 2019, and he plans to leave politics after that \u2013 the work of a singular, premeditated career complete. \u201cMission accomplie,\u201d Hannan quipped to me, on two separate occasions. \u201cAs we like to say in Brussels.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Hannan reads the Daily Telegraph at the European parliament in Strasbourg, in 2005. Photograph: Gerard Cerles/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOnce Britain became part of the European Economic Community, the idea of leaving it went away. A few old-stagers from the 1975 referendum on membership fought on \u2013 isolated high Tories and leftwingers, like soldiers left behind in the woods \u2013 but the cause was dead. The European project meant cheaper prices in the shops, and its force was unarguable. That began to change in the twilight of the cold war. In 1988, from the great medieval Belfry of Bruges, Margaret Thatcher decried a European superstate on the horizon, with a character and goals that were different from her own. \u201cWe have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at a European level,\u201d she said. The \u201cBruges speech\u201d established a new form of Euroscepticism. It saw a parallel between the disintegrating, clapped-out USSR and the folly of a new federal entity, designed in Brussels. It loved America, and Nato. It wanted a world of liberal nation states. Thatcher was in office to see the Berlin Wall come down. But then, like a confusing, bad dream for her most loyal supporters, she fell, and the Maastricht treaty materialised, with its portents of the euro, political integration and everything that she had warned against.\n\nHannan was part of a particular generation of young Conservatives deeply marked by these events. He was in his first term at Oxford, studying history at Oriel, when Thatcher resigned on 23 November 1990. Twenty-three days later, John Major approved an early draft of Maastricht. The sense of a mighty mistake being made has never left Hannan. By the end of term, he had founded a university society, the Oxford Campaign for an Independent Britain, at the Queen\u2019s Lane cafe on Oxford High Street.\n\n\u201cI remember swearing what the old adventure stories would call a terrible oath to do something,\u201d he told me. Hannan had spent the summer travelling through the fragmenting societies of communist eastern Europe. He had seen crowds demanding the return of national borders, languages and flags. His CIB co-founders were another history student, called James Ross, who is now a composer, and Mark Reckless, the former Conservative and then Ukip MP. Hannan and Reckless had been to Marlborough College, in Wiltshire, together. They bumped into each other that summer in Budapest.\n\nThe CIB came to dominate conservative student politics at Oxford at a time of acute ideological anxiety. Nicky Griffiths, later Morgan, the former education secretary, was a member. \u201cThere were all these countries and societies and economies up for grabs,\u201d she said. Most students were all over the place, figuring out what they believed in, but not Hannan. \u201cHe was clearly the leader,\u201d said Mark Littlewood, the current director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, the free-market thinktank. Littlewood was pro-Maastricht and frequently found himself up against the dapper star of the CIB in debates at the Oxford Union. \u201cNightmare,\u201d he told me. Handkerchief in his top pocket, Hannan wiped the floor with all comers, despite having a slightly odd, otherworldly quality. \u201cI mean this in the fondest possible way,\u201d said Littlewood, \u201cyou could almost think, this is someone from a slightly previous age.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Thatcher delivers her \u2018Bruges speech\u2019 in 1988 in which she warned against a European superstate. Photograph: Rebecca Naden/PA Archive/Press Association Images\n\nHe was, in a way. The only child of ageing parents, Hannan was born in Lima, Peru in 1971. He was raised on a poultry farm outside Chaclacayo, not far from the capital. The Hannans, who had come from Lancashire to Latin America after the first world war, were part of a once-prosperous British expat community in the country. But the nation of Hannan\u2019s childhood was destabilised by coups and anticolonial feeling. One of his early memories is of his father, Hugh, frail with illness, facing down a mob who had come to seize the estate.\n\nHannan boarded in the Cotswolds from the age of eight. Britain in 1979 was a revelation. \u201cI couldn\u2019t understand these adults saying England is finished, going to the dogs,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one in Peru spoke like that.\u201d Ever since, friends and foes have remarked on the power of Hannan\u2019s learnt patriotism. Roger Scruton, the conservative writer and philosopher, first met Hannan when he gave a seminar to sixth-formers at Marlborough. \u201cThe expat mentality is belonging to the old country,\u201d Scruton told me, \u201cand the inability to accept that it is changed beyond repair.\u201d\n\nAt Oxford, Hannan\u2019s screeds on Maastricht quoted Aristotle, Shakespeare and William Pitt the Younger. But he also had an eye for a stunt. Conservative ministers visiting the CIB were ambushed and photographed with anti-EU T-shirts, while Hannan\u2019s speeches \u2013 as his writings are now \u2013 were littered with arch, aphoristic observations. Lord Salisbury was able to run the British empire with 52 civil servants. King\u2019s College, Cambridge, has produced more Nobel prize winners than France. The world\u2019s oldest parliaments all hail from small islands. Goldman Sachs wants you to vote remain. \u201cA Hannan soundbite does stick with you,\u201d said Littlewood. \u201cHe does make you think.\u201d\n\nThe Eurosceptic heroes of the time were the 22 Conservative MPs who rebelled against the Maastricht bill in May 1992, almost bringing down the government. The following spring, as he was about to graduate, Hannan wrote to them and offered himself as their researcher. Around a dozen agreed to form the European Research Group (ERG), with Hannan as its secretary.\n\nIn Westminster, the ERG was part of a lattice of energetic, new anti-EU organisations, such as Patrick Robertson\u2019s Bruges Group, and Bill Cash\u2019s European Foundation. Hannan joined the young activists who staffed the offices and wrote the pamphlets. He and Reckless, who was then working as an economist at SG Warburg investment bank, shared a flat above the John Snow pub in Soho. They hung a huge Union Jack over the fire escape, threw parties and believed they were on to something much bigger and more alive than keeping a fading government in power. \u201cDon\u2019t ever make the mistake of thinking Dan was a young fogey,\u201d said Douglas Carswell, who met Hannan while he was on work experience in the Commons that year. \u201cThis was a radicalised streak of thinking.\u201d\n\nThe job of the ERG was to keep the European debate alive, and to make contact with like-minded campaigners across the continent. But Hannan and his group also consciously sought to bend the Conservative party to their thinking. \u201cFor us the EU was the litmus test for the generation above us,\u201d Reckless told me. After the defeat to Labour in 1997, they attached themselves to Michael Howard as the most Eurosceptic candidate to lead the Conservatives. Gove, who was writing for the Times, remembers meeting Hannan, who was supplying lines and jokes for Howard to use in the House of Commons, that summer. \u201cHe was very, very clear-minded and clear-sighted,\u201d Gove told me. \u201cSome people find certainty attractive. Other people find it unsettling.\u201d Hannan was 24 years old.\n\nFor all its fervour, though, Euroscepticism in the late 1990s could not have been more unfashionable. New Labour was ascendant, and openly intent on deeper integration with the EU. In the summer of 1998, Tony Blair praised the incoming single currency and the prospect of Britain adopting the euro became the next line of battle in the European debate. The ERG published a paper, The Euro: bad for business, written by Reckless, and Hannan organised two conferences on the subject before helping to establish Business for Sterling, a single-issue pressure group to fight what was, at the time, a widely expected referendum.\n\nLargely forgotten now, Business for Sterling set the template, and included some of the key personnel, for the 2016 leave campaign. (Vote Leave\u2019s initial vehicle, Business for Britain, was named in homage.) Although the group was chaired by Tory rebels and right-leaning grandees \u2013 led by Rodney Leach, a merchant banker, who later became a lord; Rupert Hambro, of Hambros Bank, and the Marquess of Salisbury \u2013 it was outwardly cross-party and apolitical. \u201cBusiness for Sterling were the first campaign to sort of bring those concerns out of the political margins and into the real mainstream,\u201d Theresa Villiers told me.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dominic Cummings, the man who came up with the slogan \u2018take back control\u2019, in 2001. Photograph: David Levenson/Getty Images\n\nNick Herbert, who had run the Countryside Alliance, was in charge. (This year, Herbert, who is now an MP, led the Conservative campaign for remain.) He hired a brilliant young campaign director, a former investment analyst, whose last job had been in Russia, called Dominic Cummings. Hannan was by now flitting back and forth between the ERG and his job writing leaders for the Daily Telegraph. He thought about how to frame the European question for a national audience. \u201cThis was when I started realising how much the mechanics of a campaign matter,\u201d he told me. \u201cSimply by talking about keeping the pound rather than opposing the euro, we added 15 points.\u201d\n\nBusiness for Sterling recruited Bob Geldof, Vic Reeves and thousands of students to its cause. It helped keep opinion polls set against joining the Euro and deterred the new Labour government, and its pro-European allies in the City, at their moment of peak of popular influence. Hannan and Cummings and the rest of the new crowd \u2013 all in their 20s \u2013 came away with their first victory scars against the establishment. \u201cWe did feel that bonding that comes from a ridiculed minority,\u201d said Hannan.\n\nEighteen years later, many of Business for Sterling\u2019s funders and supporters gathered to the flag again. Villiers was one of many long-term Eurosceptic campaigners who realised that, although they were underdogs, they had fought a version of this battle before. \u201cIt is funny,\u201d she told me. \u201cAlmost at every point I assumed remain would win. But it certainly did occur to me the disadvantage they had was they had been thinking about this referendum for possibly a year. Whereas people like Dan, it has been their life\u2019s work. The whole of their adult working life had been building to this moment.\u201d\n\nBusiness for Sterling succeeded because it found language and symbols \u2013 the Queen\u2019s head on a fiver \u2013 that touched the nerves of millions of people. Pulling out of the EU was a different ball game. There was no word for Brexit in the 1990s. Even Eurosceptic MPs didn\u2019t mention it as an option. The language of choice for Tory rebels was of \u201creform\u201d; \u201cfundamental reform\u201d if they were feeling brave. \u201cWhatever weasel words,\u201d Reckless told me. \u201cDan and I were always clear that our objective was leaving the EU, and that was what we were working towards.\u201d\n\nHannan was one of the first elected British politicians to suggest the idea publicly. In the spring of 1998, believing a referendum on the euro was imminent, he began to look for a seat in the European parliament. Tory MEPs were among the most ardent pro-Europeans in the party, and it seemed like a logical, if audacious, place to take the fight. Hannan\u2019s age \u2013 he was now 26 \u2013 and his polished, bracing stump speech marked him out from the other candidates. \u201cI was saying we should take powers back and we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to come out if we can\u2019t,\u201d he told me.\n\nConservative party activists loved it, but Hannan\u2019s bold language alarmed party headquarters. \u201cI was told that he was a fanatic,\u201d said Edward McMillan-Scott, the leader of the Tory bloc of MEPs at the time. McMillan-Scott tried to sabotage Hannan\u2019s campaign, and the young candidate was questioned furiously at an open primary at the London Arena in May. But the ploy backfired. Hannan delighted the crowd again, and the following summer, he was elected to the European parliament as a Conservative candidate for the south-east.\n\nThe Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams. We are realistic. There is something in his life that affected him Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White\n\nOnce inside the heart of the EU, Hannan set about discrediting it. A former researcher in his office told me that duties were divided between responding to constituents and \u201cthe more naughty stuff\u201d of seeking out waste and hypocrisy in Brussels for Hannan\u2019s column in the Sunday Telegraph. Hannan fell out with most of his Conservative party colleagues when he wrote about the expenses they were able to claim, but he did not relent. \u201cI was building a campaign to delegitimise the institution,\u201d he said. In the plenary chamber, Hannan used his allotted speaking time to rail against the statist, Bonapartist European project. Fellow MEPs, particularly from abroad, listened to Hannan\u2019s ornate rhetoric in bewilderment and dismay. \u201cThe Spanish, we don\u2019t have these imperial dreams to go back to. We are realistic,\u201d Antonio L\u00f3pez-Ist\u00fariz White, an MEP from Spain\u2019s conservative Partido Popular, told me. \u201cThere is something in his life that probably affected him.\u201d\n\nFrom day one in Brussels, Hannan also sought to bring the Tories out of their moderate grouping, the European People\u2019s party, or EPP, and to ally them with more critical, anti-EU voices in the European parliament. Since 1979, the party had sat alongside fellow centre-right parties from countries such as Germany and Spain. But hardline Eurosceptics believed that this meant that Tory MEPs absorbed the meeker, pro-European tendencies of their continental colleagues. At first Hannan simply sat alone. But after six years of hectoring and arguing, and as new, Eurosceptic Conservative candidates were elected, he moved the entire bloc to his position. In 2005, Hannan extracted a promise from David Cameron \u2013 then a leadership contender \u2013 that the Tories would leave the EPP. In 2009, they did. (McMillan-Scott was driven out of the party.)\n\nConcentrating on arcane goals such as breaking up the EPP was a telltale move of the hardcore Eurosceptics. Another inch gained. Another bolt loosened. \u201cOur goal in politics should not be to get the right people in,\u201d Hannan told me once, paraphrasing Milton Friedman, the American free-market economist. \u201cIt should be to set the incentives so that even the wrong people will do the right things.\u201d But behaving like this, and working to another order of events, separated Hannan and the other Maastricht diehards \u2013 even from fellow Tories who might otherwise agree with them. \u201cThe view at the centre was these were the people who had kept the Conservative party out of power for years,\u201d said Gove. \u201cWhatever they are most passionately in favour of must perforce be at best eccentric, at worst electoral disaster.\u201d\n\nOne new MP in 2005 remembered being lobbied to support the move out of the EPP and asking an older colleague for advice. \u201cHe said, \u2018You just cannot. It looks good. But you cannot give an inch to these guys because they will never, ever accept it. They will take and take and take until they have won.\u2019\u201d Several Conservative MPs I spoke to for this article compared Hannan and his set to \u201centryists\u201d and \u201cTrots\u201d for their ideological purity, their quest to reassert what they regard as Britain\u2019s lost place in the world. \u201cThey are grammar-school imperialists,\u201d one MP told me. \u201cA hundred years ago Hannan and his ilk would have been able to vent their rather bizarre beliefs bullying people in a nether-province of India.\u201d\n\nHannan says such insults have never bothered him. \u201cIt passes by as the idle wind that I respect not,\u201d he said. He simply regards himself as a different kind of a politician. \u201cI think public life for me has a slightly didactic role, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should be trying to shift the centre ground of public opinion.\u201d Since becoming an MEP, Hannan has written six books, from polemics, such as The New Road to Serfdom, a critique of America\u2019s \u201cEuropean\u201d drift under President Obama; to historical homilies such as How We Invented Freedom & Why It Matters, a 400-page exploration of the genius of English liberty, tracing its origins back to Anglo-Saxon witans and the Magna Carta.\n\nOperating apart, however, means that Hannan can sound alarmingly unlike most other British politicians. How We Invented Freedom includes a long extract from a speech made by Enoch Powell on St George\u2019s Day, 1961. Another devout Eurosceptic, Powell eulogised the English language that day as \u201ctuned already to songs that haunt the hearer like the sadness of spring\u201d. The one-time health minister is now remembered for his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech of 1968, but Hannan frequently cites Powell as the model of the opinion-forming politician he would like to be, describing him, when we spoke, as the \u201csupreme exemplar of that in his generation\u201d.\n\nFor years, within the Tory party, Hannan was also notorious for helping to write William Hague\u2019s so-called \u201cforeign land\u201d speech in 2001. The speech\u2019s attacks on Europe and tough line on asylum seekers were perceived as racist, and it is still regarded as a nadir in the party\u2019s recent political messaging. But when we talked about the speech this summer, Hannan said: \u201cThere is sort of a hobbit-like element to a lot of British people. They don\u2019t want to be told something until they have worked it out for themselves.\u201d\n\nStill, there were times when the road seemed so long, and so hard, that Hannan despaired. In 2005, the EU seemed to defy referendums in both France and the Netherlands, where voters rejected a new constitution for the bloc, by repackaging the proposed reforms and forcing them through under a new name: the Lisbon treaty. Hannan wondered whether the whole project was in fact unstoppable. \u201cThey\u2019ll do it all by stealth,\u201d he thought, \u201cand they will get to where they want to go.\u201d Cameron\u2019s new-look party was determined \u201cto stop banging on about Europe\u201d and Hannan came close to joining Ukip. In 2007 and 2008, he met Farage several times to discuss his defection, but in the end, the Tories broke with the EPP, and he stayed with the Tories.\n\nIn November 2009, though, the Conservatives abandoned their own manifesto promise to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. Hannan called Cameron\u2019s office to resign from his duties in Brussels \u2013 he was the party\u2019s legal affairs spokesman in Europe. A senior aide picked up the phone. \u201cI said \u2026 I just think you\u2019ve made the most terrible mistake,\u201d Hannan recalled. But he promised to step down without publicity. The adviser thanked him, and asked Hannan what he planned to do next. \u201cI\u2019m going to devote myself full time to securing and then winning a referendum on leaving the EU,\u201d Hannan replied. The aide laughed down the line. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Farage and Daniel Hannan in 2009. They haven\u2019t spoken since 2014. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA\n\nHannan put the phone down. He was in his office in Brussels. The Macauley poem, Horatius at the Bridge, entered his mind: \u201cWho will stand on either hand / And keep the bridge with me?\u201d He thought of Carswell and Reckless, his closest friends in politics, whom he spoke to almost every day. (Reckless became a Conservative MP a few months later.) Then Hannan ran through his old, Eurosceptic allies. He ended up in touch with the Democracy Movement, a descendant of James Goldsmith\u2019s Referendum party, which had entered candidates in the 1997 election. At the time, the Democracy Movement had its own plan to bring about an in-out referendum in the UK, which was called the People\u2019s Pledge.\n\nLike other successful Eurosceptic campaigns, the People\u2019s Pledge was scrupulously cross-party \u2013 it had mainly Labour staffers \u2013 and didn\u2019t make the mistake of asking for too much. The premise was simple: it identified Labour and Conservative MPs under pressure from Ukip in their constituencies, and asked them to publicly support a referendum on the EU. The People\u2019s Pledge launched in March 2011. By October, there was a petition signed by 100,000 people, a debate in parliament and 81 MPs signed up, more and less against their will. Hannan spoke at rallies and impressed donors.\n\nEurope was the last thing that the Conservative-led coalition government wanted to address. There was so much else to attend to. The economy. Public service reform. The big society. \u201cOh God, so annoying,\u201d is how a former Cameron adviser described the pressure from the Eurosceptics. \u201cConstantly demanding to see the prime minister.\u201d Gove, then education secretary, felt particularly torn whenever the subject came up. The tactics of the People\u2019s Pledge, and Hannan\u2019s role in it, made many of his colleagues uneasy. On the substance of the argument, however, Gove sided with the young speechwriter he had met in the 1990s. \u201cMore and more of what Dan said, I would find myself agreeing with,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I tried not to think about it whenever possible.\u201d\n\nWith the eurozone in crisis, and signs of support for a referendum from Labour, the pressure grew. In March 2012, Boris Johnson signed the People\u2019s Pledge. Six months later, a rebellion masterminded by Reckless defeated the government over its contribution to the EU budget. Cameron was cornered, and announced the planned referendum at Bloomberg\u2019s London headquarters the following January. Like George Osborne, Gove argued against it. \u201cI didn\u2019t think offering the referendum was a good idea,\u201d he told me. \u201cI thought, This is being offered as a stopgap, not as a carefully considered recalibration of Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe. It is more about dealing with an immediate political dilemma.\u201d\n\nBrexit: how a fringe idea took hold of the Tory party | Matthew d\u2019Ancona Read more\n\nBy then, the skeleton of the leave campaign was already in place. In August 2012, Elliott and Hannan had been invited to spend the weekend at the country house of Lord Leach \u2013 the former chair of Business for Sterling, who died 11 days before the referendum \u2013 on the Norfolk coast. Over the years, Leach had become more or less neutral on the EU question, and he had arranged a house party to discuss possible options for a referendum. Of the group, Hannan and Elliott were the most doubtful of Cameron\u2019s ability to reform the EU.\n\n\u201cDan was basically, \u2018He is not going to do it. Don\u2019t believe him,\u201d Elliott recalled. In the garden, Hannan urged Elliott to start thinking about what a Brexit campaign might look like. A year earlier, Elliott had run the winning \u201cno\u201d side of the referendum on the alternative vote with a message that had impressed Hannan with its bloodymindedness. Rather than engaging with the principles at stake, Elliott had focused on the cost of changing the voting system \u2013 an impressive-sounding \u00a3250m \u2013 and sent dustbin trucks apparently heaped with money through the streets of Westminster.\n\n\u201cI thought it was the most rubbish argument ever,\u201d Hannan said. But it worked. Behind in the polls at the start, \u201cNo to A/V\u201d won with 67% of the vote. Elliott had also proved adept at bringing rightwing donors and thinkers to what was a dry, democratic exercise. Leach had chaired the campaign. While Crispin Odey, a hedge fund manager who later contributed more than \u00a3650,000 to pro-leave groups, chipped in \u00a320,000. (In the run up to the vote, Odey bought gold and bet against house-building companies. On 24 June, as the pound collapsed, he made around \u00a3220m. \u201cCrispin,\u201d as a friend told me, \u201chas the common touch of a Medici.\u201d)\n\nThe new campaign took its playbook from Business for Sterling. Elliott used the initial vehicle, Business for Britain, to set about winning friends and funding from the City. At the same time, he pondered the looming, awkward alliance with Ukip and more protectionist, anti-immigrant strains of anti-EU thinking. \u201cWe needed each other,\u201d he told me. Based on the 2014 European election results, Elliott reckoned that the Ukip vote would be worth around 30% in the referendum. The job of Vote Leave would be to win the centre ground with a reassuring, forward-looking tone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless \u2013 Hannan\u2019s closest friends in politics \u2013 celebrate Reckless\u2019s byelection win for Ukip in 2014. He lost the seat at the 2015 general election. Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images\n\nElliott compared the task to the New Labour project of the 1990s. \u201cWe needed new characters, like Gove and Boris and Gisela Stuart,\u201d he said, \u201cand a new message. Dan in a sense provided us with that message.\u201d Elliott hired Cummings, as campaign director, who coined the all-important slogan, \u201cTake Back Control\u201d, while the deliberately crude figure of \u00a3350m per week, to describe Britain\u2019s EU budget contribution, echoed Elliott\u2019s successful A/V strategy.\n\nHannan worked the political side. In the autumn of 2014, his allies Carswell and Reckless left the Tory backbenches for Ukip \u2013 one month apart \u2013 in synchronised defections designed to keep up the pressure on Cameron for a referendum, and, in theory anyway, dilute Nigel Farage\u2019s dominance of the party. A year later, as the vote approached, and Cameron began his doomed renegotiation, Hannan reached out to Gove, Johnson, Villiers and others. \u201cI spoke to Boris and made my pitch,\u201d Hannan said. \u201cThe only thing I will say is that he was obviously agonising about the issues.\u201d (Johnson did not respond to a request to comment for this article.)\n\nAt least three of Gove\u2019s memorable soundbites \u2013 including people being \u2018fed up with experts\u2019 \u2013 were thought up by Hannan\n\nBy the time the actual campaign was under way, Hannan\u2019s work was more or less done. \u201cTwenty years of inch-by-inch, person-by-person, converting those in the Conservative party to his vision,\u201d said Littlewood, of the Institute of Economic Affairs. Hannan went to Vote Leave\u2019s weekly strategy meeting, chaired by Gove, but his biggest impact on the national debate was probably subliminal. \u201cDan would often express views that I had myself,\u201d said Gove, \u201cwhich he would present in a crisper, more elegant and more coherent way.\u201d At least three of Gove\u2019s more memorable soundbites \u2013 about people being fed up with experts, joking about British MEPs losing their jobs, and comparing pro-remain economists to Nazi scientists \u2013 were Hannan lines. Villiers borrowed freely from her friend\u2019s speeches. From needling and courting one or two \u201couters\u201d in the late 1990s, Hannan watched 137 Conservative MPs announce their support for Brexit.\n\nHe took part in 104 events and debates during the campaign, giving his final speech at Runnymede, where Magna Carta was agreed in 1215. He spent the night of the vote in Vote Leave\u2019s headquarters, next door to Lambeth Palace, with Cummings and the rest of the team. (Elliott was in Birmingham.) There was no party planned. \u201cDominic is very puritan about these things,\u201d said Hannan. When victory was certain, Hannan stood on a desk in the office and delivered the St Crispin\u2019s Day speech from Henry V \u2013 \u201cWe few, we happy few, we band of brothers\u201d \u2013 substituting the names of people who had worked on the campaign. He didn\u2019t go to bed until midnight the following day.\n\nOn the Monday after the vote, at around six o\u2019clock in the evening, Matthew Parris, the conservative columnist, found himself standing a few feet away from Hannan on College Green, outside the Houses of Parliament. Hannan was having an argument, on air, with Christiane Amanpour of CNN. When the fall of Cameron consumed other senior figures from Vote Leave, Hannan became uneasy about the way that Brexit was being reported, particularly abroad. \u201cThe story taking shape was that Britain had just voted, as it were, for Donald Trump,\u201d he told me. Hannan took on as many interviews as he could, to put across a more positive interpretation of events, but he often found himself under hostile questioning. With Amanpour, he lost his temper. \u201cYou guys have been shouting \u2018racist\u2019 for so long,\u201d he told CNN, \u201cthat you weren\u2019t listening to what we were actually saying.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christiane Amanpour interviews Daniel Hannan\n\nEven by the standards of those numbing, chaotic days, Parris was taken aback by the ferocity of the encounter. \u201cHe was very uncomfortable and very angry,\u201d Parris told me. He has known Hannan since the mid-1990s, and later accused him in the Spectator of being willing to exploit xenophobia in order to pursue his own, more abstract goals. \u201cHe has ridden a tiger, and knows the tiger he rides,\u201d Parris wrote. \u201cI find him a bit scary,\u201d he said, when we spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t think he sees himself in politics to give effect to what the public thinks, but to what the public ought to think, which is quite different.\u201d\n\nHannan, naturally, cannot bear this kind of talk. When we first met, in Strasbourg, in early July, I asked him whether he really believed that the nation had voted for his free-market, internationalist version of Brexit. \u201cCan you see how patronising that is?\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, remainers are saying basically, \u2018These thicko, working-class bigots weren\u2019t listening to you. And let me now tell you \u2013 having ignored them \u2013 let me tell you what they really think.\u2019\u201d\n\nInstead, Hannan spoke of polls that showed that sovereignty was the primary concern of leave voters, rather than immigration, and of the economic shock that had not come. He admitted that because of the closeness of the vote, we were unlikely to become the \u201coffshore, low-tax, global free-trading entrep\u00f4t\u201d that he longs us to be. Hannan\u2019s chosen Brexit would be rather soft, by current standards: something along Swiss lines, with opt-ins for various sectors to the regulations of the single market. He believes that compromise on free movement is possible, and that the Swiss government was making progress on the subject until talks were shut down before the British referendum. There is precedent, he pointed out, in his Hannanite way: EU immigration to Liechtenstein is capped at 71 people per year.\n\nHow remain failed: the inside story of a doomed campaign | Rafael Behr Read more\n\nIt all sounded so reasonable when he talked which, of course, is Hannan\u2019s gift. \u201cEven if you fundamentally disagree with him, you find yourself nodding along,\u201d said Nicky Morgan. Like other senior politicians who campaigned for remain, she disagrees with Hannan\u2019s analysis of what drove the result, and is anxious about the future. \u201cI think we are in the calm before the storm,\u201d she said. Morgan has been called a traitor twice in her constituency of Loughborough, and has heard calls for the removal of a Polish community that has been there since the second world war. She didn\u2019t hear much about free trade and parliamentary supremacy in May and June. \u201cTalking to people who voted leave \u2026 \u2018back\u2019 was a very important word. One of the most depressing things was this, \u2018I want to take our country back.\u2019 Back to what?\u201d\n\nNigel Farage has his own reasons for disagreeing with Hannan. The two have not spoken since 2014. (Farage says the two fell out over his approach to immigration; Hannan says that Farage underwent \u201ca personality change\u201d.) We met recently, in Westminster. The celebratory moustache was gone. He was just back from the US, where he had addressed a Trump rally in Mississippi, and was smoking on the patio. He had been thinking about the similarities between the core Brexit vote, and Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s not the have-nothings \u2026 They have got something, but they are concerned about the change in society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe basic feeling is that something has gone wrong; that we are not in control; that our political class aren\u2019t the same as us, are detached from us.\u201d\n\nLike Hannan, Farage started out making a case for why Britain should leave the European Union \u2013 around trade and sovereignty and democracy \u2013 in the early 1990s. But he realised that the argument only went so far. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what most people are bothered about,\u201d he said. The mystery, for Farage, is that Hannan and his group have never figured this out. \u201cIt\u2019s cultural,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seemed to approach the referendum as if it was an Oxford Union debate. I don\u2019t think they have met any real people in their entire lives.\u201d Farage said he didn\u2019t hear much about Hannan\u2019s free-market, open ideals on the doorstep either. \u201cIt is another disconnect isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIs it possible for someone to crave something for so long, and then be deluded about why it happened? To strive and strive, only for the country to fall into a different, meaner, poorer future? I once asked Hannan why he had dedicated his life to getting us out of the European Union. \u201cIt was the independence issue,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt was the idea of self-government.\u201d I told him that \u2013 as a citizen of the same country \u2013 I still didn\u2019t really get it. I couldn\u2019t see the freer land that he was seeking, even now that we had cut ourselves adrift. \u201cIt\u2019s a big philosophical difference,\u201d said Hannan. \u201cBetween the mentality of the powerful bloc run by competent, educated people and the mentality of \u2018trust the people\u2019.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to be rude. \u201cWe are all conditioned by outlook, experience, genes, whatever. Two people will very often look at the same thing and have very different takes on it.\u201d\n\nWe were on a train back to London, in late August. Hannan had just spoken at a Conservative club lunch in Worthing, on the south coast, where he was the guest of honour. The lunch had been held in a small hotel. More than a hundred had turned out, a swirl of floral prints and club ties. I sat on Hannan\u2019s table, where he remarked, thought-provokingly, on the scale of British immigration to Spain. \u201cIt is the great migration of our time,\u201d said Hannan, pointing out that there were more British people in Spain than people of Pakistani origin in the UK. \u201cHow many of them are on benefits?\u201d, one woman, in curls, asked promptly. Hannan ate his roast beef, smiled, and did not reply.\n\nAfter lunch, he rose to speak. The Olympics had just finished, and someone gave Hannan a homemade medal for his work on Brexit. The MEP thanked the room for putting him out of a job. The microphone wasn\u2019t working, but he did not need it. With his voice high and precisely cadenced, Hannan spoke of his hopes for the years to come. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be that hard.\u201d And he exhorted the audience to remember great British achievements: the medals table, and two wars against German tyranny, the abolition of slavery. \u201cThe idea that we can\u2019t now make a success of living under our own laws, trading with our friends and allies on every continent, while governing ourselves, is not worthy of a country like this one.\u201d Hannan paused. \u201cCheer up my friends.\u201d The lunchers laughed.

In reality, one of those things \u2013 Mr Renzi\u2019s fall \u2013 has come to pass; but the other \u2013 a Hofer win in Austria \u2013 has not. Sunday\u2019s votes tell us that Europe faces a shared crisis with distinctive national forms. To explain such events it is important to pay much closer attention to national politics in Europe than biased observers in Britain ever bother to do.\n\nAlexander Van der Bellen\u2019s win in Austria is a genuine blow to the far right. In May, before the rerun was ordered, Mr Van der Bellen defeated Mr Hofer by only a 0.6% margin; on Sunday, the former Green leader boosted his majority to a 6.6% margin, more than 300,000 votes. He did so by running an explicitly pro-European campaign \u2013 worth remembering in the wake of the Richmond Park byelection, where Sarah Olney did the same. In Austria, women were decisive, by a 62%-38% margin. So were the cities; Vienna voted almost 2:1 for Mr Van der Bellen. Nor was there a generational split: over-60s voted for Mr Van der Bellen, as did the under-30s.\n\nAustria\u2019s welcome result should be a note of caution to those who assume that voters across Europe will blindly embrace the more nationalistic option in all circumstances. Austria\u2019s 2016 elections have been humbling for the old order; the centre parties of left and right that have ruled for decades both failed to reach the final round. The fact that 47% of Austrians voted for Mr Hofer is a warning for the future. But Sunday\u2019s outcome is a timely reminder that Austria has a leftwing tradition as well as the rightwing one that gets all the publicity.\n\nItaly\u2019s referendum was likewise a defeat for the establishment. Mr Renzi was humiliated, and by a larger-than-forecast 18-point margin. He won only in his own region of Tuscany and two others. Most of the north and all of the south voted against his proposals to boost central government powers to drive through economic reform. Italy\u2019s strong regional tradition had much to do with this. But so did the fact that Italy is still, as it has been since 1945, largely a rightwing country. Mr Renzi\u2019s threat to resign if he lost was fatal. It united the rightwing parties with those on the left who dislike his reform programme. It was an abject defeat for a leader whose response to the migration crisis deserved better.\n\nBritish Eurosceptics have been rubbing their hands for weeks at the prospect of an Italian crisis. They hope Mr Renzi\u2019s fall will mean an election that will bring anti-European parties to power and will trigger a run on the banks that could force Italy out of the eurozone. Neither outcome can be dismissed. But the early signs are that much of this is wishful thinking from people who have now segued from wanting the UK out of the EU to actively seeking the collapse of the EU altogether. Early Italian elections seem unlikely, while the markets steadied on Monday. And Italians remain, in general, markedly enthusiastic about the EU. Nevertheless, unlike in the UK Brexit vote, where older voters\u2019 dislike of Europe outweighed younger voters\u2019 support for it, in Italy older people stood by Mr Renzi, while younger voters turned against him. That is not a good sign for Italy\u2019s future.\n\nThe postwar European project is threatened in multiple ways and many countries. Without reform it may buckle. But the current tendency among British anti-Europeans is to frame every electoral test in Europe as interchangeable with Britain\u2019s Brexit vote and the Trump victory in the United States. This is mendacious. Politics in Britain, even, isn\u2019t always about the EU. And one reading of Austria\u2019s vote (and of Richmond Park) could be that it was a reaction against Mr Trump. Europe\u2019s weekend contests have been widely depicted in a typically misleading and solipsistic way on the right. Neither result can be adequately explained in that Eurosceptic frame.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/074f2e39b0ca44a18eaf57a123dea1dbddd02d29/0_107_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5e6bc92a39ccac62a14f93f53f21f83e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9c982219a748534095fc95349f1602016a6bc7/0_0_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1163f1101f44c58d432e2bb40e354f20", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40fb86a1a78594f0cd21f96acee31f61aaa07e26/0_60_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=82a10692e93e9dc4d55c1bb77f3a3d22", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09f945c782f18f15fa6947e93dad16eeb4cfd8b8/0_62_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d199cde49417a0d9b7da8b3fa19429e4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9c982219a748534095fc95349f1602016a6bc7/0_0_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7dc6b3cb82df7e34a895746145c3bcdc", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Europe%2CItaly%2CAustria%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CMatteo+Renzi%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CThe+far+right", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ac3bf939d42f6dd79f2be617e2849b9f8cadb39/0_142_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=499ad7ea452d1a21c7c43a03ec7a53a9"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c9c982219a748534095fc95349f1602016a6bc7/0_0_3536_2122/master/3536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7dc6b3cb82df7e34a895746145c3bcdc", "date": "05/12/2016"}, "rank_186": {"title": "Theresa May risks becoming an accidental Europe-wrecker | Rafael Behr", "text": "After Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, continental governments above all fear contagion. Once the precedent is set, voters in other countries could be infected with the same rebellious spirit.\n\nAnxiety about a great unravelling may be overblown. British Euroscepticism has unique cultural properties, and the messy aftermath of our referendum looks like a recommendation not to follow. Still, there is a desire in some quarters \u2013 in the European parliament, the commission and some capitals \u2013 to escalate the trauma of Brexit as a warning against imitation: pour encourager les autres.\n\nMay says she will reveal Brexit plan before triggering article 50 Read more\n\nOther voices, in the Netherlands and Germany for example, are more conciliatory. Whether amity prevails depends on how the British side conducts itself. A starting point would be to avoid cheering, xenophobic nationalists in other countries as if they were franchises of the Brexit spirit. When Nigel Farage predicted (wrongly) that Norbert Hofer, leader of Austria\u2019s Freedom party, would win the presidential election last weekend, he was making a forecast of desire. He prematurely marked Austria down as the next point on a graph of ballot-box revolutions, following the Brexit-Trump trajectory.\n\nEU membership was not on the ballot in Austria. Nor was it an explicit question in Italy\u2019s constitutional referendum the same day, although Eurosceptics and populists were prominent in the coalition that rejected Prime Minister Matteo Renzi\u2019s reforms and brought down his government. Public enthusiasm for the EU is shaky across the continent and Theresa May\u2019s position is weakened every time a British politician appears to relish the decline of a system to which her negotiating counterparts are emotionally and strategically wedded.\n\nMay tells European leaders she wants a strong EU because that would be in Britain\u2019s interests. She prefers stability and continuity to turmoil and suspicion. Unfortunately, the radical impulse behind Brexit contains a different, more destructive logic. If political union enslaves the free spirit of the British people \u2013 as the Tory high priests of Euroscepticism believe \u2013 surely it is unkind to want other nations to continue suffering in captivity. The devout Brexiteer has a missionary duty, spreading the good news to benighted foreigners under the Brussels yoke.\n\nSome were more honest about this than others during the referendum campaign. Michael Gove made a speech in April celebrating contagion. \u201cWhat will be catching is democracy,\u201d he said. A vote to leave would be \u201cexciting\u201d because it might herald \u201cthe liberation of a continent\u201d. To politicians overseas who felt their democracy could survive without the Govian sacrament, that sounded like a threat.\n\nIn their ruthless flight from liberalism, Tories have left morality behind | Zoe Williams Read more\n\nSome British Eurosceptics believe the eurozone and perhaps the wider EU project are fated to collapse because the imperial ambitions of arrogant elites inevitably collide with national demands for self-determination. That prophecy will become ever more important as the cost of separation is felt in the pockets of less ideologically minded British voters. It is a short step for Brexiteers from predicting a calamity to craving one. The best argument for taking the financial pain of leaving the EU would be an almighty crisis on the continent, demonstrating the wisdom of Britain\u2019s early dash for the exit. A thriving union would raise awkward questions about the UK\u2019s self-exclusion. Farage understands this well, writing this week with glee about political volatility across the channel: \u201cWe may well have escaped from a building that is catching on fire.\u201d\n\nNot all leavers are so glib. There are wreckers and reconcilers. The wreckers despise the EU and see the coming negotiations in adversarial terms \u2013 a demand for restitution of stolen sovereignty. The reconcilers dwell on what may be worth preserving in existing relations with the rest of Europe.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond is the government\u2019s leading reconciler, and it seems he has an ally in David Davis. The Brexit secretary has signalled readiness to pay contributions to the EU budget in exchange for privileges within the single market. As foreign secretary, Boris Johnson has a professional duty to be a reconciler but seems unable to forgo his past as a producer of myth-mongering, banana-straightening Europhobic journalism. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, is bored on the government bench, unable to sign post-EU trade treaties as long as reconciliation is in play. So vanity as much as ideology tilts him towards the wreckers.\n\nAnd May? She knows that wrecking talk costs goodwill in Brussels. She also fears accusations of diluting the purity of Brexit. So she embroiders emptiness with words. Her latest design: a meaningless promise of \u201ca red, white and blue Brexit\u201d. No 10\u2019s impatience with impertinent questions is showing. The government has acquiesced to opposition demands that parliament see a Brexit plan while adding a caveat that the Commons must endorse May\u2019s March 2017 deadline for triggering article 50.\n\nEarlier in the week a spokeswoman accused MPs of \u201cfrustrating the will of the people\u201d and failing to \u201cback the UK team\u201d. Downing Street is creeping into that Ukip zone where any residue of interest in European integration is unpatriotic, verging on treasonous. This is silly because May knows there is a patriotic case for avoiding a ruinously abrupt collapse in EU trade. The conflation of Brexit and patriotism also feeds an image of Europe as a hostile power with which no compromise should be brooked. That lifts the bar for any deal beyond the reach of what is possible.\n\nThe prime minister cannot play with this combative tone at home without being heard abroad. European leaders are as baffled by May\u2019s position as anyone else and they, like the rest of us, take their cues from her occasional, encrypted messages. Meanwhile, the hardliners give the impression that Brexit contains aggressive intent towards the whole European project. That threat is already undermining Britain\u2019s position. If May is in the business of reconciliation, she is running out of time to prove it. She may not be a wrecker by nature, but she could easily become one by accident.\n\n\u2022 You can catch up on the discussion on this article and others on our Your Opinions thread", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a135d5a0c8b35554068c567dafbd226b18121722/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f09bc4272033f1088651720d7ba9c014", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CTheresa+May", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a135d5a0c8b35554068c567dafbd226b18121722/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=44c6c1a02c74e2b59d5bd23d377bd9cf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Rafael-Behr,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e79c86811898d1040e6d2f5d13af4ec", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a135d5a0c8b35554068c567dafbd226b18121722/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=f09bc4272033f1088651720d7ba9c014", "date": "07/12/2016"}, "rank_103": {"title": "Why Dutch voters are about to set the stage for Europe\u2019s elections | Cas Mudde", "text": "The Dutch will vote in parliamentary elections on 15 March and, whatever the outcome, will set the stage for key elections across Europe this year \u2013 starting with the first round of the French presidential election on 23 April. Seldom has Europe followed Dutch elections so closely, and seldom have they been so unpredictable. So what can Europe expect from the Netherlands and what can we learn?\n\nFor decades Dutch elections were the most boring in western Europe, with the vast majority of people voting for the same party their whole life, creating only small electoral shifts. This changed in 2002, because of the shock effect of the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the rise of the populist Pim Fortuyn, cut short by his murder nine days before the 2002 general election.\n\nAlthough the political party that Fortuyn founded, the LPF, existed for less than six years, it fundamentally changed the political system. Dutch elections are now more volatile, the tone is harsher, and the issues broader \u2013 with immigration and Islam now dominating most campaigns.\n\nWhat are the issues in the Dutch election? The fundamentals of the economy are recovering well from the global financial crisis, with unemployment at a five-year low and economic growth at 2.3%. Healthcare and pensions are significant topics of debate, but in the absence of major economic concerns the biggest issue is immigration and integration. The agenda has been driven by the anti-Islam and anti-EU populist rhetoric of Geert Wilders, as well as the wider political climate across Europe. Dominant themes of discussion have included multiculturalism, globalisation, sovereignty, Dutch values, and how far the EU works \u2013 or doesn\u2019t work \u2013 for the Netherlands. Read our comprehensive preview\n\nWhile unconnected to the LPF, Geert Wilders has in many ways taken Fortuyn\u2019s role of enfant terrible, transforming himself from a conservative backbencher into a populist radical-right leader. Today, no article on Dutch politics is written without at least a mention of \u201cthe firebrand MP with the peroxide-blond hair\u201d who has been in a neck-and-neck struggle for first place with his former party, the conservative VVD of prime minister Mark Rutte, for months now. The former political allies \u2013 Wilders supported the minority government of Rutte from 2010 to 2012 \u2013 have become political enemies. Wilders has been attacking Rutte and his policies for years now, while Rutte has categorically excluded Wilders from a future coalition government.\n\nThe Economist recently wrote that Dutch politics are a bellwether for Europe, arguing that developments in the Netherlands tend to be followed in other European countries a few years later. In a similar way, Politico described Wilders as \u201cthe man who invented Trumpism\u201d. Both claims hold some kernel of truth.\n\nWilders is a relative latecomer to the European radical right; Austria\u2019s Freedom party (FP\u00d6) and France\u2019s Front National (FN) are decades older and their first electoral successes date back to the 1990s, years before Wilders split from the VVD and founded his Party for Freedom (PVV). At the same time, Wilders is literally a one-man show who was dominating Dutch politics through Twitter well before Donald Trump even considered running for president.\n\nAnd while the Netherlands has set some trends in European politics, most notably in mainstreaming Euroscepticism and Islamophobia, it was not always alone \u2013 Denmark has undergone a fairly similar development \u2013 and still has specific Dutch features.\n\nAcross Europe, we can see three trends in elections, which can be described in the famous terms of the German-American economist Albert Hirschman: exit, voice and loyalty. In two of these the Dutch lead the way, but one bucks the broader trend.\n\nTo start with exit (non-voting), throughout Europe turnout in national and European elections has been dropping. Although the trend is not universal, the past 10 years has seen a sharp drop in several countries. Perhaps most shocking is the situation in Greece, a country that has compulsory voting, although it is not really enforced. In 1985 the abstention rate in national elections was \u201cjust\u201d 16.2%, in 2004 it was 23.4%, and in the last elections, in September 2015, it was a staggering 44%. In other words, in a country with compulsory voting a modest majority of 56% turned out. Compared with that, the decrease in turnout in Dutch national elections is modest: in 1986 turnout was 86% and in the last two elections it was still a commendable 75%. Expectations are that turnout might actually go up in this year\u2019s elections.\n\nWith regard to loyalty (the vote for established parties), the Netherlands is very much in line with the European trend. Most European countries have seen a sharp decline in electoral support for established parties. While this development is related to societal changes that date back to the 1960s and 1970s, such as secularisation and a shrinking working class, the decline of the established parties only became a broader issue in the 1990s, and has significantly increased during the great recession.\n\nThe process has been particularly pronounced in the Netherlands. Throughout the 1980s the three established parties \u2013 the Christian democratic CDA, the social democratic PvdA, and the conservative VVD \u2013 received around 80% of the vote. In 2002 that dropped to about 60% as a consequence of the rise of Fortuyn\u2019s LPF, and it stayed like that until 2012 \u2013 although Rutte\u2019s VVD is now bigger than the CDA and the PvdA. However, in the most recent polls the three parties only have some 40% of the vote, half of what they had in the 1980s.\n\nAt the same time, voice (the support for populist parties) has increased significantly. In the 1980s populist parties barely got more than a few seats in parliament, whereas in 2002 the left populist SP and Fortuyn\u2019s right populist LPF together gained more than 20%. In the latest polls Wilders\u2019s PVV is the largest party, or at least running neck-and-neck with the Rutte\u2019s VVD, while the SP is struggling a bit \u2013 and has become less populist. Together they are close to 30% of the vote, of which the PVV would get almost two-thirds.\n\nThe combination of decreasing loyalty and increasing voice leads to fragmented and polarised party systems, which make it more difficult to form coalition governments \u2013 as we have seen in Greece and Spain, where new elections were necessary to break the deadlock. This is certainly a possibility in the Netherlands, where forming a coalition is almost impossible.\n\nThe two most likely outcomes of the Dutch elections are either a very broad coalition of four or five parties, with or without Wilders\u2019s PVV, or a minority government, dependent upon temporary coalitions to get some policies through. Whatever the outcome, it will only strengthen political dissatisfaction, creating more fragmentation and polarisation, leading to even less loyalty and even more voice.\n\nThat is the main European lesson of the Dutch elections.\n\nCas Mudde is associate professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia and the author of The Populist Radical Right: A Reader (2017)", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acdc79b4dd03eca1ced790ae6d5b7dbb9faab8b/0_148_4482_2688/master/4482.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48bc0433f9f2c5491c543f89f8bcc3b4", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acdc79b4dd03eca1ced790ae6d5b7dbb9faab8b/0_148_4482_2688/master/4482.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=effdea11b9adc783c160b9527fc47355", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Netherlands%2CEuropean+elections%2CGeert+Wilders%2CPim+Fortuyn%2CThe+far+right%2CWorld+news%2CEurope%2CMark+Rutte", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5acdc79b4dd03eca1ced790ae6d5b7dbb9faab8b/0_148_4482_2688/master/4482.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=effdea11b9adc783c160b9527fc47355", "date": "26/02/2017"}, "rank_2": {"title": "Rising Euroscepticism 'poses existential threat to EU'", "text": "Rising Euroscepticism and domestic political point-scoring pose an existential threat to the EU, according to the man tipped to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European commission.\n\n\n\nHowever, Britain\u2019s decision to leave has helped dissuade some political leaders from continuing to attack the bloc, said Jyrki Katainen, a commission vice-president.\n\nKatainen suggested Britain\u2019s EU referendum result had shown political leaders how dangerous it was to fuel anti-EU sentiment. \u201cBrexit remedied this a bit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMany governments saw that you can all of a sudden find you are in a place you never thought you can be \u2013 if you order something you most probably can get it.\u201d\n\nDutch parliamentary elections: everything you need to know Read more\n\nThe former prime minister of Finland said in an interview with the Guardian that it was now time for EU member states to take ownership of the European project. Constant attacks on Brussels by politicians engaging in party political point scoring could not go on, he said.\n\nThe new EU needed to be developed by the member states themselves, Katainen said, in order to \u201cavoid the situation where every year, in some member states, elections create an existential threat to Europe. It is not sustainable.\u201d\n\nThe Front National\u2019s Marine Le Pen, who wants to renegotiate France\u2019s relationship with the EU to \u201crestore sovereignty\u201d, is currently leading the polls in the first round of the French presidential election. In the Netherlands, the far-right candidate Geert Wilders celebrated Britain\u2019s vote to leave and has vowed to call a referendum if he gets the chance.\n\nLeaders nearer the political centre, including the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the former French presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy, have been accused of aping the language of the populist right.\n\nKatainen said political leaders in some member states had been demonising the EU for short-term domestic reasons, while some failed to show sufficient solidarity on EU policy despite being part of the decision-making process.\n\nOn Thursday, the commission criticised member states for failing to live up to their vow in 2015 to relocate thousands of refugees currently languishing in camps in Italy and Greece. Hungary, Austria and Poland refuse to participate in the EU\u2019s relocation scheme. The Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia are doing so on a \u201cvery limited basis\u201d.\n\nKatainen said: \u201c[The] 27 governments in the last two years have wanted to be part of the EU and it is fair to say that they will want to stay in the EU but some of the countries are either unwilling to participate in common problem solving or they are demonising the EU even though they have participated in the decision-making themselves.\n\n\u201cOnly for short-sighted political reasons, the governments have criticised the EU as a construction and it will have some impact on what the normal citizens think.\n\n\u201cThis kind of voiceless partnership with our member states ... is not sustainable. The commission cannot do anything in order to correct this. Citizens and national decision-makers can do it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after a white paper was published by the European commission offering member states various options for the future shape of the EU without Britain, Katainen said governments were not actually reflecting the desire for integration that he believed existed among citizens.\n\nIn comments that many will find contentious, he said: \u201cI never questioned the basis of the European integration [as prime minister]. And this is not the case in a big part of Europe at the moment ...\n\n\u201cCitizens\u2019 expectation are way higher than what the general perception is. The majority of the people are supporting integration in the eurozone area and the euro as a currency, but there are a whole range of issues, including defence, counter-terrorism, climate change, some social policy issues, where people would like to transfer power from national to EU level.\n\n\u201cPeople are more in favour of integration than the governments are,\u201d he said.\n\nJuncker will end his time as president of the commission in 2019.

They highlight a dilemma she faces over her stance on Europe.\n\nThe publicly funded survey, done late last year by the social research institute ScotCen, said that more than two-thirds of voters were critical of the EU: 25% wanted to leave the EU entirely while another 42% wanted to reduce its powers.\n\nThe survey also found that 46% of Scots wanted independence \u2013 the highest level this study had recorded, and closely mirroring the findings of commercial opinion polls. But it showed that 21% of those pro-independence voters still wanted to quit the EU, while 41% wanted its powers cut, suggesting a majority of yes voters were unhappy with the EU\u2019s influence and reach.\n\nWhen the first independence referendum took place in 2014, 17% of Scotland\u2019s voters wanted to leave the EU and 36% felt it was too powerful. The attitude of pro-independence voters has softened since 2014 when 25% wanted to leave the EU, but then 36% believed the EU was too powerful, 5% fewer than now.\n\nProf John Curtice, the elections expert who oversaw the survey, said those trends still showed ambivalence among yes voters towards Europe. Some could vote to stay in the UK rather than have independence in the EU, he said, while others might not take part.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that linking independence closely to the idea of staying in the EU could alienate some of those who currently back leaving the UK,\u201d Curtice said.\n\nJim Sillars, a former SNP deputy leader, who voted leave in last June\u2019s EU referendum, said last week he would abstain from the next independence referendum if Sturgeon insisted on joining the single market.\n\nSturgeon insisted on Monday that the Scottish National party still believed Scotland\u2019s best interests lay in full EU membership, but she and other senior party figures have made clear they could yet drop that plan in order to win the independence vote.\n\nAware of growing Euroscepticism among yes voters, they floated the alternative option of joining the European Free Trade Association instead \u2013 a model known as the Norway option and one that key interest groups, such as Scotland\u2019s vocal fishing industry, could support. That would allow full access to the single market and free movement of people, while allowing Scotland to retain control over its substantial and lucrative fish stocks.\n\nFiona Hyslop, Scotland\u2019s external affairs secretary, said the ScotCen figures showing historic levels of support for independence confirmed \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that her government had a mandate for the proposed referendum.\n\nIan Murray, Scottish Labour\u2019s Westminster spokesman, said: \u201cThis report makes clear that Scotland\u2019s attitudes towards this is much more complex than the SNP would admit. There is a big debate that needs to happen in Scotland about the Brexit process and powers coming back to Scotland.\u201d\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/111b9cc112e635931b027394c2fc095aaaa82e2a/0_323_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2d2b1ec474a3b5ebb5faa15726aabab8", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Nicola+Sturgeon%2CScottish+independence%2CScottish+politics%2CScotland%2CEuropean+Union%2CUK+news%2CEurope%2CPolitics", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/111b9cc112e635931b027394c2fc095aaaa82e2a/0_323_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=23056a853bbb76ad417f23d17455a47f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/111b9cc112e635931b027394c2fc095aaaa82e2a/0_323_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2d2b1ec474a3b5ebb5faa15726aabab8", "date": "15/03/2017"}, "rank_80": {"title": "Michael Caine: 'I voted Brexit.

Two separate political foundations tied to the AfD have recently been registered in Germany: the Desiderius Erasmus Foundation, which is associated with the party\u2019s rightwing, and the Immanuel Kant Foundation, which was registered by members of Petry\u2019s circle.\n\nOnce the AfD has entered the German parliament, the party would be able to draw state subsidies through one of the registered foundations \u2013 a system of financing political parties that the rightwing populist party has criticised in the past.\n\nThe Immanuel Kant Foundation also faces another problem: named after the 18th-century philosopher and father of the German enlightenment, it shares a name with a foundation dedicated to \u201chuman rights, democracy and the environment\u201d, founded in Freiburg in 2004.\n\nThe Freiburg Kant Foundation\u2019s spokesperson, Berthold Lange, said it was consulting lawyers about applying to the patent court to ban the AfD from using the same name.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84dd6a65b83b40026a611edf223ebc98d6e522e9/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3627b7a5b913db4de089b64eaee51562", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf6cd52e632ae962a07048b74e30cdabaaf9c74/0_44_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa18b5bca3ef050d0818c5209ca869a0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Germany%2CThe+far+right%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CAlternative+f%C3%BCr+Deutschland+%28AfD%29", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecf89133a732298ad2401fe638ee8f4736176ed/0_309_4632_2779/master/4632.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c7bd3c1d704084a23c1d8e403f604217", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52b96ece87ffa7c11ae514d98cff6077744897ba/0_191_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9857fcfba9bdaee5f1830d6827e2e0be", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f3637734841485c5765b5674321b6ffebfe325/0_129_3176_1906/master/3176.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9b3068ea7a7691d83cbfe3b70d7058dc", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a63c616b83b0b3fdab29b5660c84f85a89a9495/0_152_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=094900615a55d28281461d0a61787c12", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56c9b69771f62639064900b1c33a8b40b8b9fa6f/0_606_6126_3676/master/6126.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0443927c069280bb17c1957d82b0f256", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf6cd52e632ae962a07048b74e30cdabaaf9c74/0_44_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8a53f9d4b3ae936f5572ca84010c96ca"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abf6cd52e632ae962a07048b74e30cdabaaf9c74/0_44_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8a53f9d4b3ae936f5572ca84010c96ca", "date": "21/04/2017"}, "rank_73": {"title": "Lord Thomas of Swynnerton obituary", "text": "When The Spanish Civil War appeared in 1961, it quickly became established in the popular mind as the book on the conflict. Eulogistic reviews from liberal pundits such as Cyril Connolly and Michael Foot saw it widely accepted as a classic, and it went on to sell nearly a million copies throughout the world.\n\nAt the time he embarked on writing it, Hugh Thomas, who has died aged 85, did not know any Spanish. But he set about reading voraciously, and ruthlessly picking the brains of innumerable participants on both sides, as well as of the war correspondent Henry Buckley and the great expert on the subject, Herbert Southworth. Not only was the resulting work presented in a colourful and highly readable style, but it also marked the first attempt at an objective general view of a struggle that still excited the passions of right and left.\n\nAlthough banned in General Francisco Franco\u2019s Spain, the translation by an exiled Spanish publishing house in Paris, Ruedo Ib\u00e9rico, became a clandestine bestseller. The dictator\u2019s propagandists had never ceased proclaiming that the war had been a crusade against communist barbarism. However, the impact of foreign works by Thomas and Southworth, smuggled in despite the efforts of the frontier police, entirely discredited the standard regime line. An example of official efforts to stifle the impact of Hugh\u2019s book was the arrest of Octavio Jord\u00e1, a 31-year old working-class Valencian, at the French frontier with two suitcases packed with copies of it. At his subsequent trial, Jord\u00e1 was found guilty of \u201cillegal propaganda\u201d and \u201cspreading communism\u201d, and sentenced to two years\u2019 imprisonment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Spanish Civil War by Hugh Thomas. Photograph: Penguin\n\nIn response to Thomas and Southworth, Franco\u2019s then minister of information, Manuel Fraga, set up an official centre for civil war studies to streamline crusade historiography. It was too late. So successful was the book that even Franco himself was regularly asked to comment on statements in it. The Caudillo largely dismissed it all as lies, denying that civilians were killed when he bombed Barcelona or that there were mass executions. The book\u2019s notoriety led to colossal sales after the dictator\u2019s death in 1975. In frustration, the centre\u2019s director, Ricardo de la Cierva, called it a \u201cvade mecum for simpletons\u201d.\n\nThe degree of financial security that followed from the book\u2019s success enabled Hugh in 1962 to marry Vanessa Jebb, the daughter of the diplomat Sir Gladwyn Jebb, later Lord Gladwyn, for whom he had worked in the British embassy in Paris. She was at the centre of the social circle that met at their home in Ladbroke Grove, west London, and they had three children, Inigo, Isambard and Isabella.\n\nIn 1966 Hugh was made professor of history at the University of Reading. Although a thoroughly entertaining and popular teacher, he was never comfortable with the demands of academic life, and resigned in 1976. Whether in intellectual or social circles, he could be charming and generous, but he was quite thin-skinned.\n\nEven before going to Reading, Hugh had begun research for his gigantic history Cuba, Or the Pursuit of Freedom (1971). At nearly 1,700 pages, it was not a success. Its long early survey of the island\u2019s history, beginning with the British occupation of Havana, was found hard going by many readers.\n\nOnly when it reached Fidel Castro\u2019s revolution did it match the confident sweep of the Spanish book. After Cuba, he was commissioned to do a similar job on Venezuela, but never really got started. Moreover, he felt constrained after spending, as he put it, \u201cseven years in the study of a short period in the history of a small society and it is, therefore, natural that I should wish to write on a more generous scale\u201d. The result was An Unfinished History of the World (1979).\n\nAt the behest of his friend Roy Jenkins, he had a second unsuccessful attempt to secure a Labour seat (he had been the prospective candidate for Ruislip and Northwood in 1957-58) but was thwarted by members of the Militant Tendency on the selection committee.\n\nThereafter, if not in consequence, he publicly declared his abandonment of the Labour party and his embrace of Thatcherite free-market economics. He became one of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s unofficial advisers and was made chairman of her thinktank, the Centre for Policy Studies, in succession to Keith Joseph. In line with his new political vocation, when An Unfinished History of the World was awarded a \u00a37,500 Arts Council literary award in April 1980, he refused to take the cheque. Saying that his bank manager would be aghast, he made the gesture on the grounds that the final chapters of the book argued that \u201cthe intervention of the state [leads] to the decay of civilisation and the collapse of societies\u201d.\n\nIn History, Capitalism and Freedom, a pamphlet published in 1979 with a foreword by Thatcher, he argued that the decline of Britain was the consequence of the encroachment of the state.\n\nAt the Centre for Policy Studies, he tried to help Joseph, now education secretary, to re-establish a sense of the glories of English history that they both believed had been obscured by the works of Eric Hobsbawm, EP Thompson and others. It was a project that belied his own works on Spain and Cuba and led to accusations that a first-class historian was trying to turn a subject on which he had never worked into \u201chollow, pseudo-patriotic indoctrination\u201d. In his pamphlet Our Place in the World (1983), he attributed the decline of Britain to the transformation of \u201cthe old England of individualism and laissez-faire into an England organised from above\u201d.\n\nIn 1981 he was made Lord Thomas of Swynnerton and there were rumours that he might be sent to Madrid as ambassador, although the deficiencies of his Spanish might have made it difficult.\n\nBorn in Windsor, Berkshire, Hugh was the only son of Hugh Thomas, a British colonial officer based in what was then the Gold Coast (now Ghana), and his wife Margery (nee Swynnerton), who worked in the Colonial Nursing Service. His uncle, Sir Shenton Thomas, was the governor of Singapore who surrendered to the Japanese in 1942.\n\nFrom Sherborne school in Dorset, Hugh went to Queens\u2019 College, Cambridge, where he studied history, not very assiduously, but did attain prominence as a swashbuckling Tory president of the Union. After graduating, he led a champagne-fuelled life as a man-about-London. He was recruited for the Paris embassy thanks, it was said, to the influence of Harold Nicolson, a friend of Jebb\u2019s. He left in early 1957, claiming that he did so because of disgust with the British role in the Suez crisis. However, he may have jumped before he was pushed. Rumours swirled around about important documents inadvertently left on the Metro and/or an affair with the wife of a French minister. The publicity given to his clash with the Foreign Office made him an attractive catch for the Labour party, and he edited The Establishment (1959), a collection of essays attacking the political elite.\n\nRivers of Gold: The Rise of the Spanish Empire by Hugh Thomas. Photograph: Penguin\n\nHowever, he still needed an income. A brief stint as a lecturer at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst (1957) did not satisfy him. He tried his hand as a novelist, but The Oxygen Age (1958) did not sell. However, the previous year\u2019s equally unsuccessful novel, The World\u2019s Game, would change his life.\n\nDedicated to Jebb\u2019s friend Nancy Mitford, it cemented an already key connection. More importantly, it had been read by the gentleman publisher James MacGibbon, then a literary agent with Curtis Brown. MacGibbon invited him to lunch and told him that the scene in his novel where the hero went to fight in Israel had reminded him of volunteers in the Spanish civil war. Remarking that the time was ripe for a broad survey of the conflict, he urged Hugh to make a pitch. It was taken up by Eyre and Spottiswood.\n\nAfter Thatcher\u2019s resignation in 1990, Hugh was increasingly disillusioned by what he saw as a festering Euroscepticism. Finally, in November 1997, he crossed the floor of the Lords to the Liberal Democrat benches. He announced: \u201cI have resigned the Conservative whip in the House of Lords because since the election of May 1st last, its attitudes towards the European Union as it is presently constituted, and as it is likely to develop, have become ever more critical and sceptical.\u201d Once he was free of the politics that had never really fulfilled him, he returned to his real metier and produced a series of flamboyant works on imperial Spain.\n\nThe sparkling narrative drive of his work on Spain was carried over first into The Conquest of Mexico (1993) and then The Slave Trade: The History of the Atlantic Slave Trade 1440\u20131870 (1997). They were followed by his crowning achievement, a trilogy about the Spanish empire: Rivers of Gold (2003); The Golden Age: The Spanish Empire of Charles V (2010); and World Without End: The Global Empire of Philip II (2014). When I last spoke to him, a couple of weeks ago, he was fulminating about Brexit.\n\nHe is survived by Vanessa and his children.\n\n\u2022 Hugh Swynnerton Thomas, Lord Thomas of Swynnerton, historian, born 21 October 1931; died 7 May 2017", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9076c5bebea7ec8ef5823a447cb34c3c1a58421/0_0_450_705/master/450.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=48ffdb33ecb20c1deb2ff974c6eecf37", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=History+books%2CBooks%2CHistory%2CEducation%2CSpain%2CEurope%2CPolitics%2CUniversity+of+Reading", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/353c5fd07e8fd71173fea5337efa55b203b0a5f7/0_475_6803_4083/master/6803.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1292dda19e4968b8725a429ad07dc2ff", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/411f01cc41b68fe96d97f70b9f94e1465efc24ba/0_0_734_1107/master/734.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1516dffb6598e2b758e9dcdc7819cfcb", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/353c5fd07e8fd71173fea5337efa55b203b0a5f7/0_475_6803_4083/master/6803.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d9f96a99d4d9f867b6d10b2ae8af4c8", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/353c5fd07e8fd71173fea5337efa55b203b0a5f7/0_475_6803_4083/master/6803.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d9f96a99d4d9f867b6d10b2ae8af4c8", "date": "09/05/2017"}, "rank_91": {"title": "Plenty for the Labour party to debate openly | Letters", "text": "Those perplexed by the Euroscepticism of sections of Labour\u2019s usually internationalist left, against the majority views of party members (Corbyn avoids single market row as motion fails to make the cut, 25 September) should trace some of its roots in the 1980s. Tony Benn had developed an important overall critique of Britain\u2019s unwritten constitution based on the notion of popular sovereignty \u201cloaned\u201d by the people to parliament. This strong focus prevented him from imagining a European version of this concept. He wrongly predicted that \u201conce you have elected members of a European parliament \u2026 then the House of Commons becomes an inferior assembly\u201d (\u201cDiaries\u201d, 15 November 1974). He advocated rebuilding the UK economy \u201cbehind a wall of protection\u201d (6 November 1975), including direct import controls \u2013 arguably still feasible back then but incapable of meeting today\u2019s global economic challenges. Benn believed \u201cwe should build on national interests\u201d (19 September 1975), excluding the prospect of Europe-wide leftwing campaigns to change EU policies. But today effective forms of public ownership of economic assets, even within existing EU laws, and new rights for insecure workers, can indeed be devised and should be actively pursued across Europe.\n\nJohn Chowcat\n\nHythe, Kent\n\n\u2022 While Brexit may indeed be Labour\u2019s achilles heel (Editorial, 25 September), a far greater threat lies in the growing intolerance of alternative views within the party. There is a delicious irony in Jon Lansman\u2019s criticism of the authoritarian model of New Labour, preferring instead the authoritarianism of Old Labour stitching up the agenda and denying a debate on the most pressing political issue of our times. But then, irony was never a strong suit of the left.\n\nMuch more serious are the threats to debate culminating in the disgrace of the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, apparently requiring extra protection at the Labour conference this year. The implication of such intolerance is the destruction of Labour as a broad-based democratic party and its substitution by a cult.

She believed there was a danger of creating a mirror image of \u2018Lawson\u2019 inflation \u2013 a recession created by excessively high interest rates created by a policy of targeting exchange rates (though in fact she did not mention the ERM explicitly,\u201d recorded Turnbull in reference to the monetary system set up in preparation for the euro.\n\n\u201cShe believed there was a danger of repeating Winston Churchill\u2019s historic error of fixing the parity for the \u00a3 at too high a level.\u201d\n\nThis refers to Churchill\u2019s infamous 1925 decision, when he was chancellor, to return Britain to the gold standard at the prewar rate of $4.86 that led to depression, unemployment and the 1926 general strike.\n\n\u201cThe prime minister pointed out that for Churchill\u2019s policy to have worked it would have been necessary to secure actual reductions in the price level. The current situation was not remotely comparable,\u201d continues the note for the record.\n\nFor their eyes only: the secret stories ministers don\u2019t want you to read | Richard Norton-Taylor Read more\n\nMajor told Thatcher he agreed the economic situation was tough but warned \u201cagainst snatching at an interest rate reduction at the first opportunity\u201d and believed \u201cthe prospects for getting inflation down next year were good\u201d.\n\nBut while Major did succeed in bringing down inflation, helped by the discipline of ERM membership, Thatcher\u2019s warning that Britain had joined at too high a rate would be vindicated when Black Wednesday arrived. Britain spent more than \u00a36bn on 16 September 1992 trying and failing to keep the pound within the ERM\u2019s narrow limits. George Soros was dubbed the man who broke the Bank of England after making \u00a31bn profit in the single day.\n\n\n\nThe cabinet minutes for 10 September 1992 show that Major had praised his chancellor, Norman Lamont, for \u201chaving shown great skill in dealing with a period of extreme turbulence in the currency markets which was due to international factors beyond the government\u2019s control\u201d.\n\nHowever, the confidential minutes released on Friday show the next cabinet meeting on 17 September 1992 heard an extremely lengthy explanation by Lamont in which he blamed everything from a weak dollar to an impending French referendum on Maastricht, hints from German bankers that undermined the pound and even \u201cinjudicious remarks by some of the government\u2019s own backbench supporters\u201d which had combined to \u201cdevastating effect\u201d.\n\nMajor summed up saying the cabinet \u201cstrongly supported the action which had been taken by the chancellor of the exchequer and welcomed the return of interest rates to 10%\u201d.\n\nDuring the ERM crisis interest rates had peaked at 12% and at one point it had been announced would increase to 15% but that had been withdrawn. The 17 September cabinet agreed that Britain would resume its ERM membership \u201cas soon as conditions allowed\u201d.\n\nBut the minutes show just how long a week in politics can be. At the cabinet meeting on 24 September 1992 the confidential minutes show there had \u201cbeen a sense of relief amongst Conservative MPs that the pound had left the ERM and that interest rates were down.\n\n\u201cThere was considerable hostility towards re-entering the ERM. which was not confined to those normally sceptical of the benefits of European Community membership,\u201d record the minutes.\n\n\u201cOpposition to the bill to ratify the Maastricht Treaty had grown; about 100 Conservative MPs did not currently support it. Eight MPs had indicated they would not support the government in the vote on the motion that night. It would be a mistake to offer any concessions in response to such pressures ... If the United Kingdom did not ratify and thereby stopped the treaty coming into force, it would no longer be able to play a significant part in the future development of Europe.\u201d\n\nThe depersonalised minutes of the cabinet discussion presciently record \u201cthe government therefore had to avoid getting into a position where the Conservative party was irrevocably split on this issue\u201d.\n\nOne member of Major\u2019s cabinet, Ken Clarke in his memoir, Kind of Blue, says that \u201cthe ERM crisis had put a match to the dry tinder of resentment that backbench and grassroots Conservatives continued to feel about the fall of Margaret Thatcher two years earlier..... Black Wednesday had opened the Eurosceptic floodgates.\u201d\n\nTo that extent it also marked the political moment that the movement that led to Brexit became mainstream among Tory MPs.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 29 December 2017 to correct the date of the private meeting between Major and Thatcher. It was 1 January 1991 not 1 January 1990.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0236cf930cc4200125fcda99fab20b44a9babdd1/0_327_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a8462128096ba981eed2f500f79e8b6f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a0f88097becb70d7deeee1e5553702225b6e14a/0_359_5201_3121/master/5201.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8a5c6504c145ff9cbff0a1e003ce746d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=National+Archives%2CUK+news%2CJohn+Major%2CMargaret+Thatcher%2CPolitics+past%2CPolitics%2CNorman+Lamont%2CEconomic+policy%2CEconomics%2CBusiness%2CCurrencies%2CSterling", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4207d1860f4dc77e3cf843c8d289f184fdc4ce71/0_145_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=df1499831b2d21ed163cbc6997c92997", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49236327509270aaaef4b6e33d709a23f1a480d5/0_553_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5ef39e967b04df3db100303a8aa5b051", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a71d20e175877ed06ee974540ddaf9091bac1b6/1059_130_630_378/master/630.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0051138f533cd33c619fbc011b63149a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4207d1860f4dc77e3cf843c8d289f184fdc4ce71/0_145_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8391918b1c19fdbf704e8806420252d6"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4207d1860f4dc77e3cf843c8d289f184fdc4ce71/0_145_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=df1499831b2d21ed163cbc6997c92997", "date": "29/12/2017"}, "rank_21": {"title": "German ambassador: second world war image of Britain has fed Euroscepticism", "text": "Exclusive: Peter Ammon says some Brexiters were motivated by a sense of national identity built around UK standing alone\n\nThe image of Britain standing alone in the second world war against German domination has fed Euroscepticism in the UK, but does little to solve the country\u2019s contemporary problems, the outgoing German ambassador to London has told the Guardian.\n\nDr Peter Ammon described the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU as \u201ca tragedy\u201d and a depressing moment, but also warned that Britain had \u201cillusions\u201d about the Brexit talks.\n\n\u201cIf you have illusions about what you can negotiate, then it is very difficult. You end up in a divorce in which you say: \u2018It was always your fault,\u2019 and you find some example, and start a blame game,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a valedictory interview, Ammon, who is due to retire from Germany\u2019s diplomatic service this month after holding the posts of ambassador to Paris, Washington and London, also told the Guardian:\n\nBritain is likely to lose international influence as a result of Brexit.\n\nHigh levels of immigration into the UK from the EU, one of the key drivers of Brexit, are coming to an end because of higher growth in the EU.\n\nNo offer will be available to the UK that is a halfway house between the situations of Canada and Norway.\n\n\n\nAmmon said Britain was rightly proud of its history, but some Brexiters were motivated by a sense of national identity built around Britain standing alone in the second world war.\n\nWith British cinemas full of films such as Darkest Hour and Dunkirk, Ammon said: \u201cHistory is always full of ambiguities and ups and downs, but if you focus only on how Britain stood alone in the [second world] war, how it stood against dominating Germany, well, it is a nice story, but does not solve any problem of today.\n\n\u201cI spoke to many of the Brexiteers, and many of them said they wanted to preserve a British identity and this was being lost in a thick soup of other identities. Obviously every state is defined by its history, and some define themselves by what their father did in the war, and it gives them great personal pride.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe described the perception that Germany dominates the EU as \u201ca horrible story\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I tell people in Germany I am confronted by this narrative occasionally in public debates they say: \u2018This cannot be true. You are joking. This cannot be true. That is absurd,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nAmmon said he had great confidence in Britain, but he feared its \u201cinfluence will be diminished\u201d after Brexit.\n\nAmmon identified three illusions or concerns that needed to be addressed to prevent a breakdown in the talks, relating to the benefits of future UK free trade deals, the Irish border and the terms of a specific UK-EU free trade deal.\n\n\u201cThe idea that there is in future a bonanza or a pot of gold somewhere through free trade agreements with third parties seems fanciful,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe idea that you leave the customs union because the customs union would forbid you from entering separate free trade agreements with third countries concerns me. What happens if, as is likely, Britain comes back from these negotiations and says: \u2018What I have got here is not very spectacular\u2019? What I fear is there will be a blame game for this non-success. It will be explained as \u201csomething the Europeans have done\u201d.\n\nThe ambassador is doubtful that the UK will be able to negotiate free trade deals with countries such as South Korea that are better than those the EU currently enjoys.\n\nHe also questioned how the issue of the UK\u2019s border with Ireland could be resolved if the UK was outside the customs union. \u201cThere may be a desire on both sides not to have a border, but, without being in a customs union, I cannot see how to have no border.\u201d\n\nBrexit: UK likely to end up with Canadian-style deal, warns Barnier Read more\n\nHe said: \u201cThe idea Britain can pick somewhere between a free trade deal combining elements of the Norway model and the Canada model will not work because the single market is built on a balanced agreement with the objective of creating a level playing field.\u201d\n\nHe also questioned whether immigration levels into the UK from the EU, one of the drivers of the Brexit vote, were any longer a problem.\n\n\u201cI have heard officials here say we are now at zero net migration from Europe so the issue seems to have gone. Instead people are desperate for plumbers and health service staff from eastern Europe, so from the outside, you wonder why people now worry. I would worry more about the shortage of staff.\u201d\n\nAmmon notes that the UK\u2019s business leaders and the Labour party seem to be moving to a similar stance on staying in the EU customs union, but says he does not detect a sea-change in the British public mood on Brexit, and does not see a way for Europeans to persuade the British to rethink the decision.\n\nBrexit: Britons favour second referendum by 16-point margin \u2013 poll Read more\n\n\u201cIt is a delicate issue. I wish we could do something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British people would not be happy particularly for the Germans to tell them what to do. This is a proud country, and rightly so. But the political assessment across Europe is that there would be no problem if Britain wanted to stay.\u201d\n\nAmmon was German ambassador during some of the talks between EU leaders and the former British prime minister David Cameron in 2015 on the possibility of reforms that could have led to terms for Britain staying in the EU. But he says he does not think a more generous German offer would have changed the referendum outcome.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think an emergency brake [on EU immigration] would have solved the problem for those who wanted to define their identity and those that wanted to protest. It would have been impossible to communicate it. There was so much propaganda in the media \u2013 I am sorry, I cannot call it anything else.\u201d\n\nBrexit, he said, was part of a wider, international populist revolt against politicians.\n\n\u201cPopulism provides easy and understandable answers to very complex problems,\u201d Ammon said. \u201cIf you say the words \u2018single market\u2019 or \u2018customs union\u2019 probably 99% of the population would not understand, but if you say: \u2018Let us build a wall to stop these immigrants,\u2019 people say: \u2018OK, that will probably help.\u2019 I know it is not a good answer to problems \u2013 Germany has not had a good experience with building walls.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298d904516378e476fa76fd2b04060b6cf54995e/971_1486_3743_2246/master/3743.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bbcab9cb97e9daa074df076a578e11f2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298d904516378e476fa76fd2b04060b6cf54995e/971_1486_3743_2246/master/3743.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cfe945bc9384609bd981f859c12b0ebb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3f2f6f7d718333657792a1e3371810948923fef/0_358_3189_1914/master/3189.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6f21e70bef60c9ccdea07e7cd78f4ed1", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62787f8760e5d89c936b058ad1d5cfe537c326ff/401_0_3599_2160/master/3599.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a0fbadf6379a32abcbfcc0a276f7a282", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09ff9db549631e330464542bba7cfa21d0651234/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8eb243c313fe4a84efdf8d21668c4f8f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cb101aefcd5a4f3e787ee3a4cc72ae690154cb5/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b18a6891f0bc066f84daf295ea5239af", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CGermany%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news%2CForeign+policy", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Patrick-Wintour,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e0667fc9c61eae5efd46797b8b06c93c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298d904516378e476fa76fd2b04060b6cf54995e/971_1486_3743_2246/master/3743.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=cfe945bc9384609bd981f859c12b0ebb", "date": "29/01/2018"}, "rank_74": {"title": "Britain\u2019s imperial fantasies have given us Brexit | Gary Younge", "text": "In his recent book Behind Diplomatic Lines, Patrick Wright, a former head of the UK diplomatic service, provides an illuminating account of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s worldview. The former British premier wanted South Africa to be a \u201cwhites-only state\u201d, and believed the Vietnamese boat people should be pushed into the sea before they reached Hong Kong. In addition, the late prime minister was particularly gripped by \u201cGermanophobia\u201d.\n\nGerman ambassador: second world war image of Britain has fed Euroscepticism Read more\n\n\u201cShe seems to be obsessed by a feeling that German-speakers are going to dominate the [European] community,\u201d Wright writes. \u201cAny talk of German reunification is anathema to her.\u201d At one point it got so bad that the former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd claimed: \u201cCabinet now consists of three items: parliamentary affairs, home affairs and xenophobia.\u201d\n\nSo when the outgoing German ambassador to Britain claimed this week that Brexiteers were fixated on the second world war, he was on to something. Referring to the popularity of films such as Darkest Hour and Dunkirk, Peter Ammon said: \u201cHistory is always full of ambiguities and ups and downs, but if you focus only on how Britain stood alone in the [second world] war, how it stood against dominating Germany, well, it is a nice story, but does not solve any problem of today.\u201d (If the second world war taught us anything, it was that you couldn\u2019t stand alone. They weren\u2019t called \u201cthe allies\u201d for nothing.)\n\nThere were some sound reasons for voting to leave the EU \u2013 although the campaign was rarely fought on them, and wasn\u2019t won because of them. And this nostalgia for a particular, and peculiar, version of our history long preceded Brexit. Remarking on the chant \u201cTwo world wars and one World Cup\u201d that rang out whenever England played Germany at football, academic Paul Gilroy wrote, in After Empire: \u201cThe boast to which the phrase gives voice is integral to a larger denial. It declares nothing significant changed during the course of Britain\u2019s downwardly mobile 20th century \u2026 We are being required to admit that the nations which triumphed in 1918 and 1945 live on somewhere unseen, but palpable.\u201d\n\nBut Ammon was only half right. For while the Brexit vote was certainly underpinned by a melancholic longing for a glorious past, the era it sought to relive was less the second world war than the longer, less distinguished or openly celebrated period of empire. For if memories of the war made some feel more defiant, recollections of empire made them deluded. Our colonial past, and the inability to come to terms with its demise, gave many the impression that we are far bigger, stronger and more influential than we really are. At some point they convinced themselves that the reason we are at the centre of most world maps is because the Earth revolves around us, not because it was us who drew the maps.\n\nIt was through this distorted lens (\u201cLet\u2019s put the Great back in Great Britain\u201d) that a majority voted to leave. Ammon puts the fantasies down to war stories from Brexiteers\u2019 childhoods. \u201cObviously every state is defined by its history, and some define themselves by what their father did in the war, and it gives them great personal pride.\u201d But British history didn\u2019t stop after the war. Empire was more recent and, for a considerable element of the Brexiteers\u2019 campaign, more personal.\n\nDouglas Carswell, the sole Ukip MP during the referendum, was raised in Uganda; Arron Banks, who bankrolled Ukip and the xenophobic Leave.EU campaign, spent his childhood in South Africa, where his father ran sugar estates, as well as in Kenya, Ghana and Somalia; Henry Bolton, the current head of Ukip, was born and raised partly in Kenya; Robert Oxley, head of media for Vote Leave, has strong family ties to Zimbabwe. One can only speculate about how much impact these formative years had on their political outlook, (Carswell attributes his libertarianism to Idi Amin\u2019s \u201carbitrary rule\u201d) but it would be odd to conclude they didn\u2019t have any.\n\nThe past 18 months has illustrated the rapid journey from hubris to humiliation\n\nBut if echoes of empire reverberated through the campaign, they have also framed our negotiating strategy. The past 18 months have illustrated the journey from hubris to humiliation. For a couple of generations, we have seen our attributes and others\u2019 weaknesses through the wrong side of a magnifying glass; now our diminished state is becoming fully apparent, and, like Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, reciting Kipling in Myanmar, we are struggling to adjust.\n\nThis awakening would be funny (abroad they find it hilarious) if it were not so consequential. Johnson told the Commons the EU27 could \u201cgo whistle\u201d for an extortionate Brexit bill. They whistled; now we will cough, to the tune of \u00a335-40bn.\n\nDuring her 2017 election campaign, Theresa May, channelling her inner Thatcher, boasted about being a \u201cbloody difficult woman\u201d. \u201cThe next man to find that out will be Jean-Claude Juncker,\u201d she claimed. In fact Juncker, the president of the European commission, and his team have found May more overwhelmed and befuddled than overwhelming and belligerent. After one Downing Street dinner, European negotiators concluded that she \u201cdoes not live on planet Mars but rather in a galaxy very far away\u201d.\n\nIn a recent private meeting between May and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, the two leaders reportedly found themselves in a tragicomic conversational loop. May kept telling Merkel: \u201cMake me an offer.\u201d To which Merkel would reply: \u201cBut you\u2019re leaving \u2013 we don\u2019t have to make you an offer. Come on, what do you want?\u201d To which May would retort: \u201cMake me an offer.\u201d\n\nA change of leader won\u2019t make this right. Lacking authority and coherence, haemorrhaging relevance and credibility, May is a faithful reflection not only of her government but of the country at this moment. Brexiteers have ostensibly got what they want: Brexit. They assumed we could dictate the terms; we can\u2019t. They assumed we could just walk away; we can\u2019t. They had no more plans for leaving than a dog chasing a car has to drive it. They are now finding out how little sovereignty means for a country the size of Britain in a neoliberal globalised economy beyond blue passports (which we could have had anyway). What we need isn\u2019t a change of leader but a change of direction.\n\nMay is no more personally to blame for the mess we are in with Europe than Anthony Eden was for the mess with the 1956 Suez crisis \u2013 which provides a more salient parallel for Britain than the second world war.

But the data from Catch-EyoU project, part of the Horizon 2020 research funding programme headed by the EU, found that more than 50% of respondents showed some kind of positive identification with the EU \u2013 one of the highest figures of any member state. And they weren\u2019t just interviewing middle-class university graduates. This was across all socio-economic groups.\n\nThis demographic voted to remain, of course, but in light of the referendum result, you might expect to see high levels of Euroscepticism among focus groups. The climate and level of political discourse certainly feels very Brexity. We are constantly being told that Brexit is what the people voted for, that the 48% have been forgotten. But then, when does the political climate ever reflect what young people are thinking?\n\nThis isn\u2019t something young people will just get over. It is a profound betrayal\n\nThe surprise referendum result seems to have acted as a catalyst for this group to start thinking differently about the EU. Our departure will strip them of rights and benefits to which they had been entitled since birth. These rights were valued, especially freedom of movement.\n\nThe sense of despair that younger adults feel at the prospect of having their EU citizenship taken away from them cannot be overestimated. This isn\u2019t something they will just get over. It is a profound betrayal. They were born EU citizens. Despite initial reports, there was a fairly high turnout (64% of 18-24 year olds). \u201cIt is not a cloak, it is my skin,\u201d one young woman wrote of her political identity, in the aftermath of the referendum. If that sounds dramatic, consider how you would feel having your British passport taken away from you. It is the same thing for those of us born with EU passports. Yet, with barely a year to go, there remains no mass youth anti-Brexit movement. In the US, we see young people mobilising on issues such as gun control: taking to the streets, writing op-eds, giving powerful, articulate interviews. Here there is muted, resigned acceptance.\n\nAttempts have been made: Our Future Our Choice, a youth campaign against Brexit, is touring universities and writing open letters to Jeremy Corbyn, arguing that soon the UK population will consist of remain voters (as Brexit voters age and die). But this remains a relatively small campaign and, even with time running out, it feels as though younger adults have become resigned to their fate.\n\nThe complexity of Brexit doesn\u2019t help. The March for Our Lives protesters in the US have an obvious and immediate moral argument; their very lives are under threat. Young people here might have moral objections to the consequences of Brexit, such as increased inequality and suffering among the most vulnerable in society, but the referendum result was, for all its faults, democratic. Perhaps the apparent acceptance of what is to come reflects the role young people play here: that of not quite citizens. \u201cYoung people in the UK are living through a period where their views and aspirations are only validated if they turn out at the ballot box,\u201d Mejias tells me.\n\nJustine Greening warns that young people could undo Brexit Read more\n\nIn further research he conducted for LSE, on youth representation, Mejias found that UK government policies treat young people as incapable, victims, or potential troublemakers, when many are in fact politically engaged, if not always in the traditional way. He explains that the last UK-wide youth policy, now seven years old, was called Positive for Youth. In it, the government was seeking to \u201crebrand\u201d the image of young people from negative to positive. That such an effort was required speaks volumes.\n\nMaybe it is inevitable that an ageing society will have a discursive climate that does not reflect the views of younger demographics. Older people dominate all spheres; there is simply less room for young people to make their voices heard. Perhaps the forums for debate are wrong: people in their teens and early 20s aren\u2019t as engaged in old media such as newspapers and the Today programme. Maybe they have given up trying to engage. But we can\u2019t disengage \u2013 that\u2019s a luxury, with the clock ticking towards a disaster that will define our lives and that of the nation for decades to come. If young remainers care about these rights, they must fight to keep them.\n\n\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CYoung+people%2CSociety%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CProtest", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f3a2f7457d2c20f5d4af7c15b442aa493efa5f/0_290_5076_3046/master/5076.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0be41b58ede90a3432f302c16629ba51", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f3a2f7457d2c20f5d4af7c15b442aa493efa5f/0_290_5076_3046/master/5076.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8255bd872bd5ab3f442d7564efe53750", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Rhiannon-Lucy-Cosslett,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6113dce05688aac65b3c02e171d89d99"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f3a2f7457d2c20f5d4af7c15b442aa493efa5f/0_290_5076_3046/master/5076.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0be41b58ede90a3432f302c16629ba51", "date": "02/04/2018"}, "rank_47": {"title": "Lord Temple-Morris obituary", "text": "It is hard to remember now, but once upon a time, not so long ago, the Conservatives were the pro-European party. None exemplified that spirit more determinedly than Peter Temple-Morris, the former MP for Leominster, in Herefordshire, who has died aged 80. So disillusioned did he become with the party\u2019s increasing Euroscepticism that in 1998, after 24 years in the Commons, he crossed the floor and joined the Labour party.\n\nTemple-Morris, dapper, suave, genial and with smoothly coiffed and neatly parted hair, might have been drawn from Conservative central casting, destined from birth to go into politics. Born in Cardiff, he was the son of a former MP, Sir Owen Temple-Morris, for many years a judge in Wales who had been the National Conservative member for Cardiff East, and his wife, Vera, (nee Thompson). Peter, educated at Malvern college, went to St Catharine\u2019s College, Cambridge, and became chairman of the university Conservative association (1961).\n\nThe following year he qualified as a barrister \u2013 he would later also serve as a solicitor \u2013 practising on the Welsh circuit and then in London (1966-76), fighting the customary unwinnable seats of Newport, Monmouthshire, in 1964 and 1966, and then Norwood in London in 1970, before winning Leominster at the February 1974 general election. He held the seat until his retirement at the 2001 general election.\n\nUnlike Kenneth Clarke and Norman Fowler, \u201cCambridge mafia\u201d colleagues from around the same time, Temple-Morris never became a minister, serving only briefly as Fowler\u2019s PPS in 1979, the year that Margaret Thatcher came to power. Instead he sat on a succession of Commons select committees.\n\nAs a traditional one-nation Tory, Temple-Morris was entirely out of sympathy with Thatcher, as he admitted in his memoirs, Across the Floor: A Life in Dissenting Politics (2016): \u201cShe was not my type, nor did she ever share my politics \u2026 I could not stand being lectured and hectored by someone who would not let you get a word in edgeways.\u201d\n\nProfoundly pro-European, he also had an interest in Iranian affairs \u2013 his wife, Taher\u00e9 Khozeim\u00e9-Alam, whom he married in 1964, was the daughter of a Tehran senator \u2013 and served for many years on British-Iranian groups such as the Iran Society and the British-Iranian Business Association. He also became actively involved in the peace process in Northern Ireland, as co-chairman of the British-Irish inter-parliamentary body through the 1990s. Martin McGuinness described him as \u201cone of the most honourable British politicians I have ever met\u201d, and Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister of the period, called him: \u201cA key player in the work of delivering peace.\u201d\n\nBut it was with his Eurosceptic colleagues in the parliamentary Tory party that he found himself increasingly out of sympathy. He supported his friend Michael Heseltine in his leadership bid to oust Thatcher in 1990 \u2013 and fought off a no-confidence motion in his constituency led by Norman Tebbit\u2019s brother Peter, who accused him of showing \u201cutter contempt for the views of members and causing serious disunity in the party\u201d in the process. Even his political opponents in Herefordshire agreed that he was a good constituency MP and he was widely personally liked in the Commons: Nicholas Budgen, the arch-sceptic Tory backbencher, described him as a model Conservative MP.\n\nBut by the early 1990s the disillusionment with the Tories\u2019 direction of travel was showing. He mused publicly that perhaps he had joined the wrong party and should have been a Labour or Liberal Democrat member instead. Norman Tebbit agreed. \u201cA quickie divorce would leave Leominster Conservatives and Mr Temple-Morris free to seek happiness with new partners,\u201d he wrote sardonically in the Daily Telegraph in 1996. The Tories, Temple-Morris wrote, were evolving from a tolerant and gentle party to one more nationalist and less European.\n\nThe crunch came with the election of Labour, led by Tony Blair, in 1997. Temple-Morris finally fell out with his party following its tactical decision to oppose the Good Friday agreement over the release of prisoners convicted of terrorism \u2013 \u201cinexcusable nit-picking\u201d, he claimed \u2013 and sat for some months as an Independent One-Nation Conservative, before Labour managers choreographed his move to their side. He was not the only defecting Conservative, but his was a valued scalp. The Tories reacted sniffily, with Iain Duncan Smith claiming Temple-Morris had been in the wrong party \u201calmost from the word go\u201d. Nevertheless his old friend Fowler lamented it was a pity the Tories had let him get away.\n\nOn leaving the Commons, Temple-Morris was awarded a life peerage. In his memoirs he remarked ruefully that his career might have been different: \u201cI would not have been a rebel but rather a team player, stayed longer at the bar and then used the Commons for advancement as opportunities arose. This would have meant a totally different life and probably a less enjoyable one, even if I had gained high office.\u201d\n\nHe and Taher\u00e9 had two daughters and two sons.\n\n\u2022 Peter Temple-Morris, Lord Temple-Morris, politician, born 12 February 1938; died 1 May 2018", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CLabour%2CConservatives%2CUK+news%2CWales%2CIran%2CNorthern+Ireland%2CMichael+Heseltine%2CBrexit%2CCardiff%2CBarristers", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52244f081e4defa31a86970694ad3deb8012850/0_106_1686_1012/master/1686.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b02812caa8b1f52e26d3bc0e6dd933b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52244f081e4defa31a86970694ad3deb8012850/0_106_1686_1012/master/1686.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2933009cb26571466d616bcc18ec708d", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f52244f081e4defa31a86970694ad3deb8012850/0_106_1686_1012/master/1686.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b02812caa8b1f52e26d3bc0e6dd933b", "date": "03/05/2018"}, "rank_56": {"title": "Populists\u2019 rise to power in Italy sets perilous precedent for EU | Jon Henley", "text": "Italy\u2019s new government, likely to be formally confirmed within the next few days, sets a perilous precedent for Brussels: it marks the first time a founding member of the EU has been led by populist, anti-EU forces.\n\nFrom the EU\u2019s perspective, the coalition of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the far-right League looks headstrong and unpredictable, possibly even combustible. Leaked drafts of their government \u201ccontract\u201d include provision for a \u201cconciliation committee\u201d to settle expected disagreements.\n\nMainly it looks alarming. Both parties toned down their fiercest anti-EU rhetoric during the election campaign, dropping previous calls for a referendum on eurozone membership (popular votes on international treaties are, in any case, barred by the Italian constitution). But as they approach power, the historical Euroscepticism of the M5S and the League is resurfacing.\n\nAn incendiary early version of their accord called for the renegotiation of EU treaties, the creation of a euro opt-out mechanism, a reduction in Italy\u2019s contribution to the EU budget and the cancellation of \u20ac250bn (\u00a3219bn) of Italian government debt.\n\nItaly\u2019s M5S and League parties asked for more time to iron out policy Read more\n\nThe parties\u2019 leaders, Luigi Di Maio of M5S and Matteo Salvini of the League (who counts the likes of Marine Le Pen and Viktor Orb\u00e1n as his allies), were quick to say this leak was premature, and a later version of their contract showed the section on Europe had been much watered down.\n\nThe euro opt-out had gone, and calls for changes to EU treaties and monetary policy were marked in red, meaning they are yet to be agreed. But the draft still urged a debate on the EU\u2019s stability and growth pact, greater powers for the European parliament, a denunciation of austerity policies and the repatriation of \u201ccertain EU competences\u201d to member states.\n\nThe general tenor certainly suggests the new government will not back down from its belief that \u2013 in the words of one senior League official, Lorenzo Fontana \u2013 \u201cpeople come before economic obligations\u201d. Complaining about \u201cunelected Eurocrats\u201d, M5S\u2019s Di Maio said it was time for Italy to \u201cshow courage \u2026 and change things\u201d.\n\nThe coalition could also fall out with Brussels over its plans for a clampdown on immigration and a call to cancel all economic sanctions on Russia. But of far greater concern in EU capitals are a raft of tax-cutting, welfare-boosting and budget-busting economic and social policies that could spell serious trouble in the eurozone.\n\nBoth parties\u2019 election manifestos promised to scrap pension changes made in 2011. They also reportedly plan to introduce a 15-20% flat tax and some form of minimum basic income, both of which may get watered down but are almost certain to be reflected in drastic tax cuts and big increases in welfare spending.\n\nEconomists and the Italian media have costed the agreed M5S-League policy programme at between \u20ac65bn and \u20ac100bn. And the two parties have repeatedly said they feel no need to respect European commitments in implementing their programme.\n\nFed up with the country\u2019s long, seemingly irreversible economic decline, persistent high unemployment, and a refugee and migrant crisis, Italy\u2019s voters turned on the political centre that has governed (or failed to govern) Italy since the 1980s.\n\nBut some analysts fear that if the radical new government they elected does push ahead with its promised policies, the result could be a Greek-style banking and debt crisis in the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy.\n\n\n\nItaly\u2019s debt mountain is \u20ac2.3tn, or 132% of GDP, the highest ratio anywhere in Europe apart from Greece. If \u2013 and it\u2019s a big if \u2013 the coalition starts reversing recent reforms and racking up deficits, markets could rapidly lose faith in Italy\u2019s ability to repay. And if that happens, things could turn quite nasty, quite quickly.\n\nEurope\u2019s, and especially the eurozone\u2019s, biggest fear is that Italy plunges into the kind of economic meltdown that eventually came very close to catapulting Greece \u2013 by that stage led, remember, by a radical-left government that was hellbent on overthrowing the eurozone\u2019s rules \u2013 out of the single currency in 2015.\n\nThe parallel is far from perfect, and neither M5S nor the League seem to be spoiling for the kind of fight that Syriza once sought.

What can Greece and even the EU expect in the future?\n\nThe end of the bailout may allow the Syriza government more room for manoeuvre. First, it seems that in the immediate future, the current budget surpluses may allow the distribution of some dividend to the most vulnerable people. Second, the government could potentially cut down on taxation while increasing social spending. Finally, there could be a further negotiation with the auditors, which, if successful, could stop the scheduled cuts in pensions in 2019.\n\nWhat is less certain, however, is whether the EU has learned anything from the past eight years. A year ago, the European commissioner for economic affairs, Pierre Moscovici, admitted that the decisions made behind closed doors regarding the Greek bailout were a scandal of democratic process.\n\nThe lack of transparency and the imposition of austerity as the only solution for the southern European countries hit by the financial crisis since 2008, at a time when other countries like Germany continued to prosper, has cast doubts on the entire European project. Ever since then, Euroscepticism has been spreading and can be seen as a contributing factor behind Brexit and the rapid ascendency to power of a number of nationalistic, xenophobic far-right parties across the continent.\n\nFor those of us who still believe in a social Europe, the real patient is the EU and the eurozone \u2013 a new treatment is urgently needed.\n\n\u2022 Marina Prentoulis is a political theorist", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3559a4d9ff43071f97c15622627245a7a3c3ca3d/0_197_5520_3312/master/5520.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=298d289eb4b6358cfcaafba9a70d9af9", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CGreece%2CEurope%2CWorld+news%2CEuropean+Central+Bank%2CEconomics%2CEuropean+monetary+union%2CBusiness%2CEuropean+commission%2CAusterity", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1a793aeb66e912d8cd7cf0f984014ad4a304c6/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2611f2ba3fd0e0e904db866808bc3b8f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1a793aeb66e912d8cd7cf0f984014ad4a304c6/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d7567931da7487388812f7b2327a7dff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1a793aeb66e912d8cd7cf0f984014ad4a304c6/0_147_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2611f2ba3fd0e0e904db866808bc3b8f", "date": "21/08/2018"}, "rank_5": {"title": "How Europe became the Tories\u2019 eternal battleground", "text": "Who would be a Conservative chief whip today? The divisions and disagreements appear far worse than anything John Major faced during the Maastricht era. Then, the tactics employed by the Whips Office, helping Major enforce his narrow majority against a bellicose group of Eurosceptics, many newly elected in 1992, became the stuff of political legend.\n\nWhy then, as now, does Europe divide the Tories? Why has the party proved incapable of agreeing upon an accepted vision of Britain\u2019s relationship with the continent? The answer comes via a circuitous story, one in which a fringe concern came to dominate, so much so that it now feels as if Europe has been the eternal Conservative battleground. The divisions within the party can be framed in different ways, but a popular rendering pitches pragmatists against ideologues, free marketeers against those who claim to defend national sovereignty.\n\nSurveying this emerging division, one could begin with Winston Churchill\u2019s rhetorical encouragement for the Council of Europe in 1948, which was greeted with indifference by his party, as was the 1950 Schuman plan for a common coal and steel community. The apathy of Anthony Eden\u2019s government to the Messina conference (1955), which led two years later to the creation of the European Economic Community, meant that the EEC emerged as a real, if unpalatable, fact without British involvement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Major, far right, at Masstricht in 1991. Photograph: AP\n\nOnly with Harold Macmillan\u2019s (failed) bid to join the EEC in 1961 and then with Edward Heath, successfully overcoming French hostility and gaining accession in 1973, did the party leadership emerge as enthusiastic cheerleaders for the European project.\n\nThroughout this period, a small nucleus of anti-marketeers (as Eurosceptics were known before 1975), expressed concerns about sovereignty and floated alternative trading relationships. These individuals, though including respected parliamentarians such as Derek Walker-Smith and Robin Turton, were on the party\u2019s periphery. They lacked a leader figure capable of converting the issue from parliamentary irritation to a national cause celebre. Eurosceptics today seek to invoke Churchillian images of defending Britain\u2019s national interests, but some anti-marketeers\u2019 political lineage can be traced back to support for Neville Chamberlain\u2019s 1930s vision of European \u201climited liability\u201d. This lineage Eurosceptics now disregard, but the second world war meant the \u201cnever again\u201d legacy carried considerable sway, both for politicians and the electorate looking to accept EEC membership in the 1970s. The 1975 referendum, to confirm Britain\u2019s first renegotiation, was a concession by Harold Wilson to preserve Labour\u2019s unity. Britons voted 2:1 Yes to Europe, and many assumed the issue had now exhausted itself.\n\nIf doubts existed among senior Conservatives about European plans for monetary convergence, these were put aside at the time for the sake of party unity. One Eurosceptic, on announcing his retirement in 1983, thought that continuing to campaign against the EEC, after it had supported Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Falklands campaign, was both \u201cinopportune and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret Thatcher launches the European parliament election campaign in 1984. Photograph: Dave Caulkin/AP\n\nThatcher was in fact agnostic about Europe during much of her leadership, but she recognised it was a tool for domestic statecraft. A chance to pitch \u201cthem\u201d against \u201cus\u201d, as she battled for European budgetary rebates, using this to deflect from her own unpopularity, and from recession and unemployment at home. Later, with the negotiations for a Single European Act, she saw her chance to finally impose a British economic, or \u201cThatcherism in Europe\u201d, vision.\n\nJacques Delors, the then European Commission president, scuppered these plans. Only belatedly did Thatcher realise that the SEA could accelerate closer integration. This provoked her 1988 Bruges speech, and Euroscepticism became mainstream. The Thatcherite monetary alliance had fractured \u2013 with former allies, such as Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson, becoming enemies for arguing that further integration (short of federalism) was necessary to protect neoliberal values.\n\nIn Thatcher\u2019s wake emerged Major, who appeared more emollient, wishing Britain to be at the heart of Europe. At Maastricht in December 1991, he pushed for EU enlargement, favoured \u201csubsidiarity\u201d (with decisions taken where possible at the national level) and secured opt-outs from the single currency and the Social Chapter.\n\nPredictions that the treaty ratification process would fall to a newly elected Labour administration were wrong, as Major won in 1992 though Europe played no real part in that election. Still, the majority of Conservative election candidates had endorsed the treaty, and senior figures were confident that the argument, while not extinct, had died down.\n\nThe honeymoon was shortlived. Although Labour\u2019s leadership was in turmoil, the Danish and French \u201cNo\u201d referendums threw the process into chaos. Written-off by commentators, and a Eurosceptic press, Major\u2019s government saw through the ratification process. Despite Eurosceptic rebellions spilling into legislative matters beyond Europe, such as Post Office privatisation and coal mine closures, he served a full term.\n\nHowever, the emergence of explicitly anti-European parties (Referendum party and Ukip) meant that the Tories kept a watchful eye for signs of a Eurosceptic electoral take-off. The answer of William Hague, leader between 1997 and 2001, was to embrace Eurosepticism and to allow his party a 1998 vote on whether to accept the single currency: 84% said no.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest William Hague, wife his wife Ffion, campaigns on \u2018Keeping the Pound\u2019. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\nHague has, throughout the Brexit process, played the elder statesman\u2019s role, urging caution and loyalty. In contrast, when he was leader, his concerns about Europe were vocal, especially over the political agenda behind the advent of the euro. His \u201cKeep the Pound\u201d campaign caricatured the bogey of a federal Europe, with the consequential loss of sovereignty, democratic accountability, and centralised economic management. But the 2001 election showed what the electorate thought of a single-issue Conservative party.\n\nOnce David Cameron became leader, in 2005, he appeared intentionally vague about Europe as he balanced the conflicting wings of his party. After election victory in 2010 it was assumed that a pragmatism of office would necessitate a continued, grudging, participation in the EU, working on the assumption that the Maastricht and euro opt-outs gave Britain the best of both worlds.\n\nThe excesses of Eurosepticism appeared contained until May 2013 when Cameron pledged to offer an \u201cIn-Out\u201d referendum on EU membership. Several cabinet colleagues announced they would vote Out, although commentators doubted the pledge would ever be fulfilled.\n\nReferendum promises had been made before and the demands for one had a long pedigree stretching back to the 1960s. With the 1961-63 EEC entry negotiations, party activists sought the reassurances of one. Macmillan gave none, nor would Heath a decade later, despite the party\u2019s own polling showing in 1970 that six out of 10 Conservative voters wanted such an option. Conservative referendum demands remerged in the late 1980s and especially during the Maastricht parliamentary process of 1991-93. Major\u2019s leadership challenger in 1995, John Redwood, was partially standing on a referendum ticket. Then, in the run up to 1997, Major became \u201cminded\u201d to hold a referendum on the Single Currency.Over this time a narrative arose that took particular hold in the 1990s claiming the electorate had been kept in the dark in 1975 about the \u201ctrue nature\u201d of the European project. Furthermore, ran this line, Britain was being punished for joining late, particularly over agriculture and fisheries policy.\n\nIn truth, historically Europe has carried limited saliency, with the electorate caring more about economic competence, to mention just one issue. It has been an issue for the periphery. However, following the electoral annihilation of 1997, Eurosepticism took control of the Conservatives. A few lone voices, such as Kenneth Clarke, tried to advocate closer monetary ties, arguing that Britain had previously been in other international monetary \u201cunions\u201d such as the gold standard and Bretton Woods.\n\nBut if you reject the EU, what is the alternative? That has proved the perennial problem for those opposing Europe. Commonwealth preference during the 1960s or, later, the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) were the two proposals, though Major dismissed the latter as a \u201csugar-coated turnip\u201d. The third was the European Free Trade Area (Efta), an organisation Britain joined in 1959 and abandoned for EU membership. In 1975, Neil Marten, one of the leaders of the cross-party \u201cNo\u201d campaign, admitted they were struggling to articulate the alternatives to EU membership.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Cameron pledges in 2013 to have an \u2018In-Out\u2019 referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nOthers countered that Europe merely required British-led reform, and as the EU expanded, federalist agendas would be diluted. Cameron assumed he could conduct such renegotiations and carry the country.\n\nHowever, in the absence of meaningful reforms, ideas about full withdrawal began to be discussed in the 1990s. Norman Lamont was one of the first to do so in 1994. Although dismissed as \u201csiren voices\u201d by the likes of Malcolm Rifkind, the speculation had begun. For example, William Waldegrave in 1997 advocated a \u201csort of European Canada\u201d: on withdrawal, Britain remained in the EU\u2019s shadow, free of central economic control, yet benefiting from the proximity of its markets. When 1997 brought electoral defeat, which would exclude the party from office until 2010, some Conservatives speculated that it might have been better if Major had lost in 1992. Many Tories may now be asking whether the same ought to have occurred to Cameron in 2015.\n\nNicholas Crowson is professor of contemporary British history at Birmingham University.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32cb90ce580794d3d513172e070f397d512a44fb/0_67_914_548/master/914.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=598981c22c461715ae2d5c229581fd88", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff30d11c60597816f95aee6836e11083c346ae41/0_163_5187_3113/master/5187.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=509bfa6e38f00b85c6a1df117208f211", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbf99d18b3f863d5ad74a241e26dcc7edb68b3c6/66_41_1684_1010/master/1684.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30050ab432586ce8506c1c8451c63aad", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c9c849db80130381ca3368b47efae7be148d3b0/0_88_2998_1799/master/2998.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=54614bf7eb457d377e4d9a59ee3fcdb5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff30d11c60597816f95aee6836e11083c346ae41/0_163_5187_3113/master/5187.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0fbe98534c1a1c16d61cf271e08c900a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22f50cc940f260b0f24ca047d286282a8cd2ff1f/0_57_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=647a844779fa332808776a637e71bf73", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservatives%2CBrexit%2CEurope%2CPolitics+past%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CEuropean+commission%2CMargaret+Thatcher%2CWilliam+Hague%2CDavid+Cameron%2CEdward+Heath"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff30d11c60597816f95aee6836e11083c346ae41/0_163_5187_3113/master/5187.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=509bfa6e38f00b85c6a1df117208f211", "date": "09/12/2018"}, "rank_41": {"title": "John Major's cabinet considered holding EU vote, papers reveal", "text": "Ministers could not agree on question for referendum aimed at quelling Euroscepticism\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nThis article is more than 1 year old\n\nJohn Major\u2019s ministers considered holding a referendum about the European Union in 1994 but could not decide what the question would be, official cabinet records reveal.\n\nFaced with mounting Eurosceptic pressure, the then prime minister manoeuvred to prevent opposition to Brussels from building up. His officials even tried rewriting some of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s increasingly critical speeches.\n\nAccording to files released at the National Archives in Kew, the cabinet met on 1 December that year and noted: \u201cAttention was drawn to the need for government to take a consistent line in response to renewed speculation about a referendum on European Union issues.\n\n\u201cSuggestions had been made that referenda should be held on two issues, the 1996 intergovernmental conference and adoption of a single currency.\n\n\u201cA referendum should not be ruled out.

Major signed off his letter to Kohl with the wish that \u201cyou will celebrate \u2026 with something stronger than herbal tea.\u201d\n\nThat year, ministers battled each other over proposals to move on to what was known as \u201csingle/double summer time\u201d to align with the central European time zone.\n\nMichael Heseltine, the then trade and industry secretary, supported the proposal. But William Waldegrave, the then chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, warned it might strengthen Eurosceptics.\n\n\u201cThis is a classic example of a second-string issue where a quietly favourable majority public view will be drowned out by a long and strident minority campaign against the change,\u201d Waldegrave wrote. \u201cAnd for good measure, the anti-Maastricht lobby will also be given a new platform.\u201d\n\nThe then Wales secretary, John Redwood, and the then Scotland secretary, Ian Lang, who worried about the effect of reduced daylight on drivers, were strongly opposed. Facing with unresolved infighting, Major sent out a note in October 1994 cancelling an economic study on the impact of switching to continental hours and concluding: \u201cThere is no likelihood of reaching consensus amongst colleagues.\u201d\n\nMargaret Thatcher, who went to the House of Lords in 1992, proved harder to discipline. \u201cTo aim for a continent without nations because nations disagree is thoroughly illiberal and it flies in the face of history,\u201d she told the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations during a tour of the US.\n\nAt a lunch in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace with Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, the former British prime minister pressed home her attack. \u201cAfter one of Mrs Thatcher\u2019s recurrent explosions about Delors, the European Community, federalism etc,\u201d an accompanying diplomat noted, \u201cM Mitterrand \u2026 said he thought that a federal Europe, as portrayed by Mrs Thatcher, was just not possible.\u201d\n\nA memo by Gus O\u2019Donnell, Major\u2019s press secretary, records an incident when Thatcher declined to deliver a speech on Europe drafted by Charles Powell, the prime minister\u2019s foreign affairs adviser.\n\n\u201cThe draft she has at the moment is not too bad in Charles\u2019 view,\u201d O\u2019Donnell warned the prime minister, \u201cbut Messrs Hamilton, Cash and Tebbit were all visitors last night and were likely \u2026 to try and toughen up the language\u201d.\n\nPowell told Thatcher her claim that the latest EU initiative was \u201can enormous and unacceptable transfer of responsibility away from national parliaments\u201d was \u201csomething of an exaggeration\u201d.

It covers a lot of the same ground as Young, but with a key theme driving the narrative: the ways in which Britain tried to deal with the competing claims of Europe and the Commonwealth. In the 1940s it seemed logical to think that there were no trade-offs involved: sufficiently loose arrangements might allow Britain to accommodate both sets of relationships, and both identities. And in any event to be European then was still to be imperialist, so there was no need to choose.

Alan Milward\u2019s The European Rescue of the Nation-State is an obvious place to start: European integration was not seen in the 1950s as a threat to the nation state. Rather, it was a way for nation states to collectively provide the political and economic stability that citizens craved, and which European nation states had so conspicuously failed to provide. And so it necessarily had to involve more than just trade liberalisation.\n\nBrexit is reminding people of the EU\u2019s benefits, but we shouldn't ignore the forces that have increased Euroscepticism\n\nCompleting the Internal Market, the 1985 European Commission White Paper prepared by Arthur Cockfield, spells out exactly why the single market was needed: \u201cThe reason for getting rid entirely of physical and other controls between Member States is not one of theology or appearance, but the hard practical fact that the maintenance of any internal frontier controls will perpetuate the costs and disadvantages of a divided market.\u201d The white paper is available online and in English, and some MPs may find it instructive.\n\nBrexit is reminding people across Europe of the EU\u2019s many benefits, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore the forces that have increased Euroscepticism, not only in the UK but across the continent. Ruling the Void: The Hollowing of Western Democracy by Peter Mair, is a short, readable, insightful essay on Europe\u2019s crisis of democratic legitimacy. The European Union, he argues, has limited the range of choices available to national governments, and has thus \u201cplayed a major role in the hollowing out of policy competition between political parties at the national level\u201d. The consequence has been \u201cdepoliticization and disengagement\u201d.\n\nOne view of Brexit relates it to similar political trends in the US, France and elsewhere. An alternative view sees it as being largely about British culture, and the argument is brilliantly made in Fintan O\u2019Toole\u2019s very funny Heroic Failure: Brexit and the Politics of Pain. One of the only upsides of Brexit from the point of view of Ireland\u2019s political class is that O\u2019Toole\u2019s polemical skills have been temporarily diverted from his traditional target, namely them: presumably, when the dust eventually settles, usual service will resume. A good antidote to excessively deterministic accounts of Brexit is provided by Dominic Cummings\u2019 blog post, \u201cOn the referendum #21: Branching histories of the 2016 referendum and \u2018the frogs before the storm\u2019\u201d. As Cummings says, \u201cReality has branching histories, not \u2018a big why\u2019\u201d, and he argues that reality could easily have branched in a different direction in 2016.\n\nTony Connelly\u2019s Brexit and Ireland: The Dangers, the Opportunities, and the Inside Story of the Irish Response is indispensable. Hopefully his remarkable series of long form essays on the RT\u00c9 website means that he is working on a follow-up.

When and if we do finally leave the EU, lawyers think that the case\u2019s principles will once again be thrown into the spotlight.\n\nIn 1988, the Eurosceptic Conservative government introduced the Merchant Shipping Act to negate the impact of the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy. It restricted access to British waters and prevented foreign-owned vessels from re-registering as British ships in order to sell their catches in Europe, but count them against the British fishing quota (a practice known as \u201cquota-hopping\u201d).\n\nLandmarks in law: when female lawyers were declared 'people' Read more\n\nHowever, the European Court of Justice ruled that this legislation broke European law. It said that the act, which provided that only British-owned boats were entitled to a share of the national fishing quota, was inconsistent with the most basic principles of European law: the freedom of movement and capital, and the right of establishment.\n\nFive law lords in the House of Lords unanimously ruled that the breach was serious enough to entitle the fisherman to claim compensation.\n\nCrossbench peer and barrister Lord Pannick says that Factortame was \u201cthe most significant decision of United Kingdom courts on EU law\u201d. \u201cIt brought home to lawyers, politicians and the public in this jurisdiction that EU law really did have supremacy over acts of parliament,\u201d he says.\n\nBefore Factortame that fact had not been widely understood, even though it had been decades since the UK had joined the European Economic Community in 1973. After the judgments, says Pannick, there was no longer any excuse for ignorance.\n\nDavid Greene is a senior partner at Edwin Coe, whose firm acted in the case. He more recently represented the hairdresser Deir Tozetti Dos Santos, who took the case with Gina Miller to the Supreme Court, successfully arguing that parliament had to legislate before triggering Article 50. When the case heard by the Court of Appeal, it led to the infamous Daily Mail headline branding the three judges \u2013 the lord chief justice, Lord Thomas, the master of the rolls Sir Terence Etherton, and Lord Justice Sales \u2013 \u201cenemies of the people\u201d for what the paper claimed was the court\u2019s attempt to block Brexit.\n\nGreene recalls how badly the establishment and commentators reacted to the Factortame decision at the time, painting it as an attack on British sovereignty by the ECJ and an attack on parliamentary sovereignty by the courts. \u201cNot too unlike the Article 50 case, it did not make the judges the \u2018enemies of the people\u2019, but it did put into question sovereignty,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAs in the Article 50 case, parliament had conceded in the Rome Treaty and the European Communities Act the supremacy of EC law and ceded sovereignty to the community. The judgment simply reflected that \u2013 but many saw it otherwise.\u201d\n\nHe says the case is now seen as \u201cgroundbreaking but not revolutionary\u201d, and suggests its principles will be wheeled out again and again if we leave with a deal, because the withdrawal agreement and withdrawal bill are based on the supremacy of EU law in the transition period (even though we will not then be a member).\n\nCarl Gardner, a former government lawyer who has negotiated for the UK and defended the government in the European courts, says that while the decision came as a shock to the British legal system, it came as \u201ceven more of a shock to the political system\u201d.\n\nBritish Euroscepticism: a brief history Read more\n\nHe suggests that along with the Maastricht Treaty in the early 90s, the decision in Factortame helped stoke Euroscepticism.\n\n\u201cThe experience made politicians more defensive of sovereignty,\u201d he suggests.

The present crisis in the United Kingdom is, however, no laughing matter. It reflects very real social and political problems and deep divisions about the future of the country. The argument over remain or leave is also between the winners and losers in globalisation.\n\nIn the 1960s former US secretary of state Dean Acheson said Britain had lost an empire and was yet to find a role. For a time it appeared Britain could be the pivot of Europe and the Atlantic world. Britain would be part of Europe on its own terms but also have a special relationship with the United States, with the British acting, as Harold Macmillan said, as the Greeks to the Americans\u2019 Romans. Membership of the European Union has disappointed many and the special relationship is today as flimsy as the friendship between Donald Trump and Theresa May. So where does Britain go now?\n\nThat discussion is part of a much larger debate across the globe about the nature and direction of societies. Fears or hopes about change, hostility or openness to immigrants, confidence in the future or a longing for a simpler past, these are not unique to Britain. We have seen this before in history, when rapid change destroys people\u2019s livelihoods dislocates communities and leaves a widespread sense of unease and, often, resentment. The debate over the repeal of the Corn Laws in the 1840s was not just about tariffs and meeting the demands for cheaper food, it was a struggle between the landed interests and the new industrialists over the future shape of British society. Before the first world war rapid industrialisation and the growth of international trade created great opportunities and great inequalities. The new working classes pushed peacefully where they could and violently where they could not for fairer conditions and a political voice. Small shopkeepers and artisans or landowners who were losing out to competition sought refuge in parties that promised to turn back the clock. Social conservatives looked back nostalgically to the middle ages.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest British humour \u2026 placards from the Put It To The People March in central London on 23 March.

Many of the Brexiters have a particular reading of British history, that the British are not part of Europe but a proudly independent and unique people who look out to a wider world. That ignores the many and ancient ties between these islands and the continent. We have seen such simple explanations before: in the 19th century the pope was plotting to take over the world; no, it was the Jews or possibly the Freemasons. Irish immigrants brought typhoid, the Chinese opium. And, then as now, there was anger at remote and unresponsive elites and plenty of politicians willing to capitalise on that.\n\nDemagogues often seize control of the political debate in troubled times. Karl Lueger, the mayor of Vienna before 1914, mobilised the lower classes by attacking capitalism and the Jews. A young Adolf Hitler watched and learned. The \u201cpeople\u201d are defined as those who are with or like \u201cus\u201d. The fascists used the language of inclusion and exclusion in the interwar years, and today we have Beppe Grillo and Marine Le Pen who talk about the \u201creal\u201d people. In her extraordinary recent outburst, Theresa May claimed to speak for the \u201cpeople\u201d against parliament. Populism is seductively simple and promises easy solutions. Lenin seized power in Russia in 1917 with the three words: \u201cBread, Land, Peace\u201d. He promised that Soviet power plus electrification would build the new socialist paradise. It never came.\n\nThe past has lessons for the present but not the ones populists promote. It should warn us to question sweeping claims, conspiracy theories, or easy answers. Above all the past reminds us to be careful what we wish for.\n\n\u2022 Margaret Macmillan\u2019s books include Peacemakers and The Uses and Abuses of History.\n\n\u2018The architects of the Reformation would have been saddened by the isolationism of Brexit\u2019\n\nDiarmaid MacCulloch\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Outward looking \u2026 Thomas Cromwell promoted a new internationalism. Portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger. Photograph: Fine Art/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nOver a year or two from 1533, Henry VIII abruptly ended a millennium of ties between the pope and the English church, by a series of acts in the Westminster and Dublin parliaments. Through force of personality plus threats and bluster, he and his minister Thomas Cromwell bullied MPs, peers, bishops and abbots into agreeing that the king of England had always actually been head of the church, but neither he nor his subjects had noticed, thanks to the cunning Roman pontiffs. All this was in aid of unilaterally declaring Henry\u2019s near-quarter-century of marriage to Catherine of Aragon null and void, so he could marry Anne Boleyn regardless of papal censure, and beget a male heir.\n\nThis reckless move threatened dire consequences for the realm\u2019s international standing. Merchants were aghast at the prospect of ruin for England\u2019s main international trade with the European lands ruled by Queen Catherine\u2019s nephew, the Holy Roman emperor (a much more powerful monarch than Henry). As Henry committed ever more extreme provocations, horrified neighbours on the European mainland might even have gone to war with him. Thomas Cromwell forwarded the plan with customary efficiency, despite having no enthusiasm for the Boleyn marriage.\n\nHenry\u2019s break with Rome led to a Protestant English Reformation \u2013 but no thanks to Henry. He was emphatically not a Protestant; in fact, he burned Protestants for heresy. The Reformation flourished in England in spite and not because of him. Did Reformation amount to Brexit? No. When Anne was executed in 1536, Cromwell, a discreet but thoroughgoing Protestant, made sure that there was no return to the pope. Instead he manipulated the king\u2019s delight in his newfound leadership of the English church to promote a new internationalism shaped by Protestant religion. The European Reformation first exploded in 1517 in northern Germany, yet thereafter it transcended and broke down local boundaries. The Reformations of England and its neighbouring kingdom, Scotland, were just part of a greater whole.\n\nProtestants resisted breaking England\u2019s natural, wider ties to Europe. They would have been bewildered and saddened by the isolationism and narrow vision of Brexit. They were looking for radical reform in the church, but once corruption and errors had been remedied, the aim was a fresh continent-wide unity, not a muddle of division and weakness. Both the Church of England and the Church of Scotland were part of \u201cReformed\u201d Protestantism, which went further than Martin Luther in its break with the past. Their partners in an international movement were the other reformed churches in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Poland and as far east across the continent as Transylvania. England in the decades after the 1530s took back control and used it to become a new sort of European.\n\n\u2022 Diarmaid MacCulloch\u2019s Thomas Cromwell is published by Penguin.\n\n\u2018As America\u2019s founding fathers show, declaring independence is one thing, making a success of it quite another\u2019\n\nMaya Jasanoff\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Parliamentary blues \u2026 in a recent speech Theresa May claimed to speak for the people. Photograph: Jessica Taylor/Xinhua/Barcroft Images\n\nBrexit campaigners liked to portray themselves as latter-day American revolutionaries, asserting \u201cindependence\u201d from the EU\u2019s imperialistic diktats. American independence does invite parallels with Brexit \u2013 but not for the reasons Brexiters think. Like Brexit, the American Revolution polarised parliament and the British public. Prime Minister Lord North, a skilled parliamentarian, called an early election on the eve of war in 1774 and successfully shored up Commons support for his policy \u2013 just what May notoriously failed to do. But as the war of independence progressed he could not contain the disputes deepened by Britain\u2019s losing military effort. Hardliners (led by George III) refused to make peace; the parliamentary opposition (led by the charismatic Charles James Fox) took to wearing blue and buff, the colours of George Washington\u2019s army. Meanwhile North\u2019s ineffectiveness condemned him to a historic berth as one of Britain\u2019s worst prime ministers.\n\nThe 52% who voted leave might fruitfully learn from the United States\u2019s founding fathers that declaring independence is one thing, but making a success of it quite another. The new US had vulnerable frontiers and remained heavily dependent on trade with Britain. In 1794, President George Washington dispatched chief justice John Jay to negotiate a treaty with Britain that earned the US \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d trading status, and required Britain to withdraw from forts along America\u2019s northwest frontier. The American public roundly condemned the Jay treaty as a pandering appeasement of British interests. But with the president\u2019s backing, the senate narrowly ratified the treaty, averting hostilities with Britain and allowing the young republic to consolidate its resources.\n\nThe 48% who supported remain can point to American independence as a classic example of how every version of nationalism \u2013 no matter how inclusive its aspirations \u2013 rests on forms of exclusion. The republic was founded by slave owners, a hypocrisy called out by Samuel Johnson: \u201cHow is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?\u201d As the US marched westward in fulfilment of its \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d, it launched genocidal campaigns against indigenous peoples. The country so famously open to immigrants has repeatedly shut demonised \u201cothers\u201d out. To this day, racism permeates the justice system and access to voting.\n\nThe Brexiter paradox, of course, is that the very same people trying to conjure up the American revolutionary spirit are bloated with delusional ideas about Britain\u2019s imperial past. Those are even more misguided. It\u2019s beyond ironic that the balance of power should be held by the DUP, which descends from Britain\u2019s last major party-splitting political issue, Irish home rule. For reckless and destructive haste, as Pankaj Mishra has observed, the rush to leave the EU resembles Britain\u2019s destructive 10-week scramble to pull out of India and Pakistan in 1947. For self-inflicted international humiliation, Brexit has now surpassed the grandiose miscalculation of the Suez war in 1956. For catastrophically vainglorious leadership, there\u2019s Tony Blair\u2019s neo-imperial intervention in Iraq.\n\nUltimately Brexit is an event of historic proportions not because it evokes precedents but because it breaks them. At least Lord North wanted to resign but couldn\u2019t. May should have resigned some time ago and didn\u2019t. Jeremy Corbyn is not canny as a Fox. In place of Samuel Johnson we\u2019ve got the performative buffoonery of Boris, and the loudest yelps for independence come from the drivers of neocolonial fantasy.\n\n\u2022 Maya Jasanoff\u2019s The Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World is published by William Collins.\n\n\u2018The petitioning campaign by the Anti-Corn Law League split the Tory party permanently\u2019\n\nMiles Taylor\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Chartists, depicted meeting in church in 1839. Photograph: Alamy\n\nAs the number of those signing the petition to revoke Article 50 continues to climb, it is salutary to recall that parliament has ignored the people\u2019s voice in the past. In 1839 the Chartists gathered a staggering 1.28m signatures, calling for parliamentary reform. To no avail. No matter that Erskine May, an authority on such matters, stated in 1844 that \u201cthe right of petitioning \u2026 is acknowledged as a fundamental right of the constitution\u201d. The House of Commons could always find reasons to veto vox populi. Petitions could not be rude about politicians, they had to be written on parchment, preferably endorsed with an official wax seal, they must not be accompanied by the \u201ctumult\u201d of a large meeting (the Chartists\u2019 first big mistake), and MPs had to vouch for the authenticity of the signatures (the Chartists\u2019 second whopper, their 1848 petition apparently included the signatures of the Queen, the Duke of Wellington and Mr Punch). And yet petitions poured into parliament.\n\nResearchers at Durham University have shown just how many there were down to the 1920s, averaging around 10,000 a year, with signatures running into the millions. Some were crazy, for example, that of the Society for the Suppression of Promiscuous Intercourse. But mostly petitions stopped parliament from doing things the people did not want, such as compulsory Sunday schooling, proposed by Sir Robert Peel\u2019s government in 1843. Anyone \u2013 man or woman, voter and non-voter alike \u2013 could petition.\n\nWe know about the petitioning campaign organised by the Anti-Corn Law League in the 1840s \u2013 the Brexit issue of the day that split the Tory party permanently, as free-traders battled with those who wanted to keep up tariffs against imports of foreign grain. But there was an equally fierce petitioning movement calling for the corn laws to remain. Petitions kept politicians on their toes too. In 1852 George Thompson was dumped by his Tower Hamlets voters after he had proved too busy trying to stamp out slavery in the US and hadn\u2019t bothered to present their petition to get rid of the window tax. All this long before TheyWorkForYou.com came along. No wonder the Victorians looked down their noses on referendums and plebiscites, the devices of such despots as Louis Napoleon, who was \u201celected\u201d emperor of the French by universal male suffrage in 1852.

Photograph: Independent News and Media/Getty Images\n\nExactly 100 years ago, the British prime minister David Lloyd George could not get enough of Europe. As leader of a coalition government his energy was absorbed by the postwar Paris peace conference. George V was none too impressed and complained to him: \u201cEverything gets hung up while you are away \u2026 no one seems capable of making any decision.\u201d\n\nThat was particularly true in relation to Ireland. In the December 1918 general election Sinn F\u00e9in had won 73 of the 105 parliamentary seats allocated to Ireland on the back of a promise to establish an Irish republic and break away from the British empire. The party abstained from Westminster and established its own parliament in Dublin while the Irish Republican Army began a campaign of violence in pursuit of independence. Ulster Unionists, meanwhile, remained trenchantly opposed to any all-Ireland republic and sought reassurances they would remain fully integrated with the UK.\n\nYet Lloyd George was happy to leave Ireland to others; only one cabinet member, Walter Long, a former leader of Irish unionists, displayed any consistent interest and he began to fashion a plan involving two parliaments for Ireland, north and south, and a Council of Ireland to address shared north-south concerns that would eventually enable Ireland \u201cto work out her own salvation\u201d. Sinn F\u00e9in rejected the proposal; Ulster unionists accepted it and the new, unionist-dominated six county statelet of Northern Ireland came into being. It was not a solution the unionists had sought; as the cabinet was told, while Ulster unionists would remain a part of the empire they would not be \u201con the same footing as citizens of Great Britain\u201d, but \u201csubject to a different regime\u201d. One third of the non-unionist citizens of the new Northern Ireland were ideologically opposed to its very existence.\n\nHaving agreed to the partition of Ireland, Lloyd George negotiated with Irish republicans resulting in a compromise treaty \u2013 an early 20th century withdrawal agreement \u2013 that created an Irish Free State for southern Ireland, a dominion of the empire. It was a compromise that split the Sinn F\u00e9in party and the country, and led to a bitter civil war that defined the politics of southern Ireland and left deep scars. Those in favour of the treaty had been faced with selling an unpopular agreement to a divided Irish parliament as the best deal on offer, with the alternative a threatened resumption of war; it was passed by 64 votes to 57. Sinn F\u00e9in had been led to believe that a review of the Irish border in the future would lead to the ending of partition \u2013 a \u201cbackstop\u201d of sorts \u2013 which never happened.\n\nDecades later, in 1965, English historian AJP Taylor suggested that with this solution Lloyd George had \u201cconjured\u201d the Irish problem \u201cout of existence\u201d. He had not. The problem had merely been shelved. What is striking is how the same themes have endured; a divided Ireland, a British prime minister so preoccupied with a wider international challenge that the Irish question is underestimated, the scrambling for a temporary solution to the Irish dilemma, Sinn F\u00e9in refusing to sit in Westminster, Ulster unionists with undue influence on government policy but still distrustful of what compromise might mean to their status within the UK.\n\nSenior Conservative Austen Chamberlain articulated the simple political priority in 1924: to prevent Ireland being \u201ca fatal influence on British politics\u201d. Throughout the decades, British prime ministers remained determined to avoid, in the memorable advice given to former Prime Minister James Callaghan, \u201cgetting sucked into the Irish Bog\u201d.\n\nClearly, that strategy did not work. It was accompanied by a wilful ignorance about Ireland which, from the late 1960s, led to the British government struggling to contain the Irish Troubles and much later, after the peace process, deciding that because Ireland was relatively peaceful, it was not a complicating factor in the context of Brexit. The Irish border question was woefully neglected during the referendum campaign. That carelessness has resulted in a new, ugly chapter in a long story of fragile Anglo-Irish relations and the political conjurers of today are struggling to find a suitable trick.\n\n\u2022 Diarmaid Ferriter\u2019s The Border: The Legacy of a Century of Anglo-Irish Politics is published by Profile.\n\n\u2018A century on from the Weimar republic, minority groups are still targeted\u2019\n\nMaryyum Mehmood\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Manifesto of hate \u2026 a vigil for the victims of the Christchurch mosque attacks. Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Images\n\n\u201cI used to believe that, first and foremost, I was a German \u2026 All that has changed over the past five years \u2026 Whether we wanted to or not, we were forced to reflect upon our Jewishness.\u201d These were the words of Georg Hermann, a popular novelist writing in 1919 Berlin. Hermann\u2019s remarks resonated with many Jews of the Weimar republic who faced the rise of antisemitism in the aftermath of the first world war. A century later, we see the same self-questioning emerge in Britain among many minority groups \u2013 Muslims in particular.\n\nWorldwide, the increasing vilification of Muslims is commonplace, unchallenged and normalised. Sometimes it remains latent, but during times of uncertainty it rears its head. With the global recession and austerity hitting those most vulnerable, there are striking parallels with the period immediately following the Great Depression of 1929. At times such as these, when people begin questioning the fabric of their society, minority groups are scapegoated. Following the global \u201cwar on terror\u201d this phenomenon is exacerbated by media narratives that perpetuate racialised tropes about Muslims.\n\nToday, Muslims are scrutinised for their everyday practices; their choice of attire is banned, their beliefs and ideologies are misconstrued, individuals are attacked and their places of worship desecrated. Similar negative stereotyping and scaremongering tactics were employed to intellectualise, and thereby normalise, the stigmatisation and abuse of Weimar Jews. The idea of Jewish identity as an existential threat to \u201cGermanness\u201d led to fervent policing and later the internment and state-led extermination of Jews.\n\nThis is not to say that Muslims are Europe\u2019s \u201cnew Jews\u201d. This would belittle the historical contingencies of the past, and disregard the uniqueness of historical antisemitism and contemporary Islamophobia respectively. It would also suggest that present-day antisemitism has been defeated \u2013 it has not. Yet there is a significant overlap in the experiences that both groups endure. Furthermore, with the global rise of populism, targeting minority groups has become mainstream. One need only look towards the manifesto of the New Zealand mosque shooter, which spewed hate against almost all minorities, yet lambasted Muslims as the most severe of threats.\n\nHistory teaches us that prejudice must never go unchallenged. My own research, exploring the responses to antisemitism and Islamophobia, shows that one of the best ways to dismantle hate-filled rhetoric is to demystify the negative stereotypes on which bigotry thrives. In the battle against prejudice the key is to unify, not be selective in our approach, and never to lose hope.\n\n\u2022 Maryyum Mehmood is a research associate at Oxford University.\n\n\u2018An American fascism would fetishise the flag. It might even sport a baseball cap\u2019\n\nSarah Churchwell\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ultra-nationalist \u2026 four Ku Klux Klan Members c1922. Photograph: Buyenlarge/Getty Images\n\nIn his 2004 study The Anatomy of Fascism, Robert Paxton suggests that the original Ku Klux Klan, which arose in the American south in the 1870s, has a strong claim to be the world\u2019s first fascist movement, one that could reasonably be seen as an indigenously American political form. All fascisms are indigenous by definition, because they are ultra-nationalist: an American fascism would fetishise the American flag, not the Nazi one. Who knows, it might even sport a baseball cap.\n\nThe second Klan, which came to its ascendancy in the early to mid 1920s, just as Benito Mussolini was coming to power in Italy, was widely recognised in the US as a specifically \u201cfascist\u201d organisation. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, it went into decline, plagued by corruption and sex scandals. But its members did not stop believing that they needed to make America great again by purifying it of citizens they viewed as lesser or \u201calien\u201d; they simply formed new groups, with different names. In 1930, the \u201cAmerican Fascisti\u201d was founded in Atlanta by a former KKK member; in 1932, a group known as the Khaki Shirts was formed, declaring its intention to overthrow Herbert Hoover. \u201cComparisons with the Fascisti of Italy and the Nazi of Germany\u201d were \u201cinevitable\u201d, its founder noted, but promised the Khaki Shirts \u201cwould be essentially American\u201d. The \u201cSilver Legion of America,\u201d known as the Silver Shirts, followed in January 1933; Hitler took power in Germany two months later. That year a report was published on \u201chome grown\u201d American fascism, counting \u201csome 103 separate fascist organisations in the United States\u201d.\n\nOne of the more famous responses at the time was by Sinclair Lewis, in his 1935 novel It Can\u2019t Happen Here. Having spent seven years listening to his wife, the journalist and anti-fascist crusader Dorothy Thompson, discuss the rise of European fascism, Lewis predicted in his novel what an American fascism might look like. It would be defined by capitalism \u2013 in Lewis\u2019s prophetic words, \u201cgovernment of the profits, by the profits, for the profits\u201d.\n\nWithin a few months Thompson launched a journalistic broadside against what she called \u201cthe lunatic fringe\u201d, noting how many of these groups invoked Christianity in their names. These reactionary groups had joined forces under the banner of \u201cthe Union Party\u201d (just as their political heirs would 80 years later in Charlottesville, when white supremacists rallied to \u201cUnite the Right\u201d). Some conservatives, she warned, would make cynical alliances with fascism rather than tolerate liberalism. Whether such a group could consolidate power, in her judgment, would depend on whether \u201cmen who call themselves conservatives\u201d began helping far-right groups in order to defeat liberals.\n\nThis idea made her remember, Thompson said, something that Huey Long had told her: \u201cAmerican fascism would never emerge as a fascist but [only] as a 100% American movement; it would not duplicate the German method of coming to power but would only have to get the right president and cabinet.\u201d Moreover, Long added, \u201cit would be quite unnecessary to suppress the press. A couple of powerful news-paper chains and two or three papers with practical monopolies of certain fields would go out to smear, calumniate and blackmail opponents into silence, and ruthlessly to eliminate competitors.\u201d All it would take was one powerful news organisation to support it.\n\n\u2022 Sarah Churchwell\u2019s Behold, America: A History of America First and the American Dream is published by Bloomsbury.\n\n\u2018Dunkirk was not a story of gritty heroism but a colossal defeat\u2019\n\nRichard Overy\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Many Brexiters inhabit this strange legend-land when British democracy stood firm against authoritarian Europe \u2026 Dunkirk. Photograph: Underwood Archives/Getty Images\n\nIt was perhaps no coincidence that shortly after the referendum vote in 2016 the film Dunkirk became a hit in British cinemas. This was a story that resonated with the Brexiters \u2013 leaving behind both the unreliable French and the aggressive Germans, Britain alone at last. Then two years later came another hit, Darkest Hour, with Winston Churchill the hero rallying the country to stand alone against the menace of a German-dominated Europe. Coincidences perhaps, but the spirit of Dunkirk and Churchillian defiance has been implicitly (and explicitly) invoked as a metaphor for Britain\u2019s abandonment of Europe in 2019 and for the stubborn defiance of the more extreme Brexiters in the face of an impending calamity: no deal with Europe echoes no deal with Hitler. Too many of those who want to leave Europe inhabit this strange legend-land of 1940, when British democracy stood firm against authoritarian Europe.\n\nIn truth the history was very different. First Neville Chamberlain in September 1939, then Churchill in June 1940, chose war and its continuation in order to save Europe from Hitler and to restore a democratic continent. These politicians were Europeans in a very real sense, otherwise they would have chosen, as some historians think they should have, the easy route of accommodation with Germany and Italy, in order to fall back on the empire and a global role distinct from the rest of Europe. Churchill used the rhetoric of Britain facing the Nazi threat alone but he wanted a restored Europe. After the end of the war he was a great champion of some kind of European unity. The Council of Europe established in 1949, a predecessor to the institutions of a united Europe, was an initiative that Churchill helped to create, indeed he originated the term in 1943. The summer months of 1940 might have been a British moment of defiant solitude in the face of near defeat, but British war aims, to the extent that they were ever articulated clearly, were to save Britain as a beacon of liberty and then to restore that liberty to Europe.\n\nThis is a history easily masked by the emphasis on the Dunkirk spirit, or very soon, if the calamity of \u201cno deal\u201d happens, a renewed blitz spirit. All of which is pointless rhetoric. Being \u201calone\u201d was of no help in 1940. There was no way that Britain and the empire unaided could have unseated Hitler\u2019s domination of Europe. That could only be achieved later thanks to the American and Soviet war efforts. Dunkirk was not a story of gritty heroism, though there were gritty heroes, but a colossal defeat. The Battle of Britain and the blitz were survived, but Britain emerged in 1941 battered and bruised, undefeated for the moment but unable to find the means to defeat the Axis enemy. Using the crisis of 1940 as a historical reference point for Brexit has this right: there are no solutions, it seems, for a painless withdrawal from Europe. And afterwards? No blitz, but plenty of damage, this time self-inflicted. Much better the image of 1945 when Britain played its part in restoring the liberty of western Europe, paved the way for the end of empire, and finally began to abandon pretensions to world power.\n\n\u2022 Richard Overy\u2019s The Battle of Britain: Myth and Reality is published by Penguin.\n\n\u2018The puzzle is why the forces of nationalism failed to achieve traction in the 1975 Europe referendum\u2019\n\nDavid Kynaston\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Changing nation \u2026 Thatcherism sowed the seeds of Euroscepticism. Photograph: PA\n\nIn immediate postwar Britain, the class structure was hierarchical and fixed; jobs were usually for life; most people lived out those lives in narrowly confined geographies; levels of trust were such that motorcycles did not have locks until 1957. And, amid largely stable party loyalties, the general assumption was that politicians were not, by and large, out for themselves. France in the mid-1950s had its populist \u201cPoujadist\u201d moment (starting as a revolt by small shopkeepers against taxes), but there was barely an echo here.\n\nPredictably, the much-mythologised 1960s sowed the seeds of what was to come in the long term. The pace of change, disturbing to many, sharply picked up (loss of empire, start of de-industrialisation, more women working, mass immigration, destruction of familiar urban environment, social liberalism, youth culture, rise of higher education). Politics became professionalised and thus more detached, and the coming of satire (Beyond the Fringe, That Was the Week That Was, perhaps above all Private Eye) began a process that in time, for all its necessary calling out of crimes and misdemeanours, helped to create a corrosively cynical and jaded attitude to politics as the default position for most people. If there was a straw in the wind, it was undoubtedly the London dockers who in April 1968 marched in favour of Enoch Powell after his \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech.\n\nWhat about the 1970s? The dominant image we have is of industrial unrest, states of emergency and general chaos \u2013 an image with a kernel of truth, but grossly exaggerated. In retrospect, the great puzzle is why the forces of backward-looking nationalism failed to achieve any significant traction in the 1975 referendum on Europe. The short answer has to be that \u201cEurope\u201d had yet to become the neuralgically symbolic issue, the focus for a whole nexus of discontents and grievances that was only in part about Europe itself.\n\nBy the 1990s, following a decade of Thatcherism, this was starting to change. De-industrialisation, job insecurity, immigration, destruction of community \u2013 all these and other trends had gone much further. And, presided over by Kelvin MacKenzie\u2019s Sun, a new, toxic popular culture had emerged that was xenophobic, glorified nationalism, and in its crude materialism and systematic resort to stereotypes implicitly or explicitly trashed the intrinsic value of education. Put another way, the raw materials of populism had gathered; and from Maastricht on, it was not too difficult to guess what their cause might one day be.\n\n\u2022 David Kynaston\u2019s Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem, written with Francis Green, is published by Bloomsbury.\n\n\u2018All media has caused alarm, but the internet has allowed populists to cut out the middleman\u2019\n\nJan-Werner Mueller\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest America first \u2026 Donald Trump at a 2016 presidential campaign rally. Photograph: Matt York/AP\n\nEvery modern media revolution has been greeted with dire predictions that new technologies would empower authoritarians and corrupt the people. Yet the fact that previous deaths of democracy by technology have been greatly exaggerated should not comfort us. There is reason to believe that this time might be different: social media are more helpful for authoritarian populists than cheap newspapers, radio and TV ever were.\n\nThere was no golden age for media and democracy, but historians would agree that newspapers played a part in democratisation \u2013 mainly because a free, highly competitive press also financed and printed the muckrakers who exposed corruption and other political scandals and thus furthered the cause of progressive reforms. Less obviously, a mass press helped to create mass publics with shared considered judgments \u2013 a precondition for holding politicians accountable at election time.\n\nRadio and TV would have seemed to help this democratic function further. Except that already in the mid-1960s, when the big US broadcasting networks dominated the airwaves with well-researched news and moderate opinions, the media theorists Marshall McLuhan and Quentin Fiore proclaimed that \u201cthe public, in the sense of a great consensus of separate and distinct viewpoints, is finished.\u201d Historians would today perhaps say the opposite.\n\nHere is the difference in our day: populism has been hugely helped by a more general crisis of intermediary institutions, political parties and professional media in particular. Populists have always claimed that they are the only authentic representatives of the people (since all other politicians are corrupt) and that only they understand the authentic popular will. They have also always distrusted any intermediaries between themselves and \u201cthe people\u201d; in their eyes, to mediate means to distort. The internet has allowed them for the first time to make good on the promise of comprehensively cutting out the middleman, and to offer what the Italian political theorist Nadia Urbinati, with a paradoxical-sounding formulation, has called \u201cdirect representation\u201d. Historically, the sense of an unmediated connection is not completely novel: one may have felt it in a crowd at a party conference, for instance. But that would have been an extraordinary experience; now, it is available day and night at the touch of a screen.\n\nIntermediary institutions introduce a degree of pluralism into politics: professional media will usually present a range of voices; parties, despite obviously being partisan, will have some internal democracy, such that one has to contend with different views. Populists are anti-pluralists \u2013 only they represent the people, and citizens who don\u2019t support them are declared by them as \u201cun-American\u201d or \u201cun-British\u201d. Hence the fact that the latest media revolution allows one to shut out all other voices is likely to make political life a lot easier for populists.\n\n\u2022 Jan-Werner Mueller\u2019s What Is Populism? is published by Penguin.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 1 April 2019.

Macron\u2019s side, narrowly in the lead, is running a campaign warning against the dangers of Euroscepticism.

Instead, Le Pen wants to team up with other European far-right nationalists and wreak havoc inside the bloc.\n\nWhen Macron explained as he arrived in Brussels that \u201cwe have a European renaissance to drive forward\u201d, it was a reference to the renaissance slogan of his party\u2019s European election campaign.\n\nFor Christian Lequesne, a professor at Paris\u2019s Sciences Po, Macron\u2019s tough stance in Brussels was both personal and political.\n\n\u201cFirst, there\u2019s the question of temperament \u2013 Macron is someone of a certain impatience, which is different to Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, who likes to allow time for things to take shape,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the most important issue is that Macron has a political project for Europe, so he\u2019s already thinking beyond the European elections. And he feels Brexit has dominated too much of the agenda. Now France wants to get on to more serious things like eurozone reform, which won\u2019t be easy, and the EU\u2019s relations with China.

Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon in Marseilles Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrance \u2013 We are all protectionists now\n\nIt used to be a dirty word in an open country that is part of the world\u2019s biggest single market. But French parties are increasingly adopting the p-word in this campaign, even if they don\u2019t always say it out loud.\n\nOn the far left, La France Insoumise supports \u201csolidarity protectionism\u201d and proposes the idea of a \u201ckilometric carbon tax\u201d: the further the product is shipped, the more it is taxed. The green fringe advocate something similar \u2013 a carbon tax at the border of the EU and restrictions on imports from countries that do not permit free union association.\n\nWhat are the European elections and European parliament? Read more\n\nMeanwhile, Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally advocates an \u201cintelligent protectionism\u201d that would support the national economy through the restoration of customs duties. The socialists too are revising their position on protectionism, a result of years of social dumping and market disruption. \u201cWe assume a form of protectionism and put trade policy at the service of ecology and the fight against inequality,\u201d says Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, leader of the influential Place Publique movement, who heads a common list with the PS.\n\nQ&A What is the Europa project? Show Hide In 2012, six major European newspapers came together to launch joint editorial projects to dig deeper into pan-European issues, understand the EU better and investigative the good and bad things emerging from the continent.\n\nSince then, we have jointly investigated the environment, youth unemployment, Brexit, immigration, euroscepticism, the eurozone the Brussels bureaucracy - and even the legacies of the first world war.\n\nWe have interviewed prime ministers and presidents, as well as a host of EU leaders, and will continue our efforts long after Britain has left the EU. The six papers are The Guardian, Le Monde, S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, La Vanguardia, La Stampa and Gazeta Wyborcza Photograph: Mark Rice-Oxley\n\nEven Emmanuel Macron\u2019s movement seems to be converted. Admittedly, the term \u201cprotectionism\u201d is not used in the program of the presidential party. But \u201cprotection\u201d is, with those of \u201cprogress\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d, the key words of the head of list Nathalie Loiseau. And the campaign slogan is: \u201cA Europe that protects.\u201d\n\nLike the Macronists, the Republican party (LR) is reluctant to use the word \u201cprotectionism\u201d. But their draft program defends customs protection, and recommends putting in place, in the face of foreign products, \u201ca double preference, European and French, on the model of the \u2018Buy American Act\u2019 by assuming to give priority to our companies and our jobs\u201d. LR wants to reserve 50% of public contracts for local companies.\n\nIf this idea, initially borne by the opponents of free trade, eventually became practically consensual, it is because the European construction is perceived as the establishment of a large market that would ultimately promote social insecurity, economic and ecological.\n\n\u201cProtectionism has been constantly associated since the 19th century with the idea of \u200b\u200bincreasing customs duties to protect oneself,\u201d says Olivier Dard, professor of contemporary history at the Sorbonne. \u201cBut is this really protectionism that we are looking at today, or a broader idea of protection that goes way beyond simply ideas of tariffs?\u201d Alexandre Lemari\u00e9, of Le Monde\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest League of nationalists Photograph: Ivan Romano/Getty Images\n\nItaly \u2013 The north-south divide\n\n\u201cWe pay too many taxes,\u201d laments Klodian Qoshja, manager of a leather processing company near the northern city of Vicenza. \u201cHere you have to work 16 hours a day to get an entrepreneur salary.\u201d\n\nTax is a dirty word in Italy\u2019s industrial north, which far outperforms the south in the wealth it generates. Northern provinces are determined to secure greater fiscal autonomy, but even though their great champion, the (formerly Northern) League party is now in government in Rome, their appeals have had little effect.\n\n\u201cAutonomy will be achieved,\u201d Salvini continues to repeat at his speeches, although his coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, are less enthusiastic. Thus far the League has not suffered for not delivering on one of its core objectives.\n\nIn this part of Italy, support for the League runs at more than 40%, dipping to about 30% nationwide \u2013 still ahead of the other European election hopefuls.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe current picture plays in the League\u2019s favour because the topic is much discussed in the regions where autonomy is demanded, while there is a cloak of silence over the other regions,\u201d says Gianfranco Viesti, professor of applied economics at the University of Bari.\n\n\u201cVotes can be maintained by promising autonomy in one part of Italy, but you can avoid losing them in other parts of Italy by not talking about it,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is a party that speaks two different languages \u200b\u200bin two areas of the country.\u201d\n\nThe village where Qoshja has his factory, San Pietro Mussolino, witnessed the highest turnout at a referendum on regional autonomy in 2017, and almost all voters voted in favour.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have always had the speech of autonomy in our blood, even before they talked about it,\u201d says Graziano Rancan, a bar owner. \u201cWe have paid so many contributions, now we continue to pay contributions but there is not enough money left to develop what we have lacked\u201d.\n\nPaolo Negro Marcigaglia, who runs an organic food company just one block from Qoshja\u2019s leather factory, sees no other options: \u201cWe make an appeal to (League leader Matteo) Salvini to keep this promise that the League has been making for decades now.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI feel a bit like a worker in a company,\u201d says Marcigaglia, making a metaphor about the state and taxes. \u201cA company in which the owner every year takes away his dividends without investing anything.\u201d Cecilia Butini of La Stampa\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The ins and outs of Brexit Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUK \u2013 The paradox of Brexit\n\nOnce it became clear that Britons would have to vote in the 2019 elections, despite having voted to leave Europe almost three years ago, the campaign very quickly became a mirror of the 2016 referendum, a microcosm of the exhausting battle for Brexit.\n\nAs the party overseeing the debacle which has seen the UK stumble through almost three years without a departure plan anyone can agree on, Theresa May\u2019s Conservatives are expected to receive a solid kicking, with even many party activists saying they will vote for other parties.\n\nAt the last elections in 2014, when the Eurosceptic mood was also strong, the Conservatives won only 24% of the vote. Polling for this month\u2019s equivalent has them on as little a 13%. They could easily place fourth \u2013 or worse.\n\nJeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party is polling marginally better, but at little more than 20% \u2013 not the sort of level a would-be government should expect.\n\nLabour go into the elections still trying to please both leave and remain supporters by promising only to back a second Brexit referendum as a possible option if no constructive deal can be reached. The party risks annoying voters on both sides of the divide.\n\nTheir campaign has so far been mainly marked by a bitter tussle over the wording on the second referendum pledge, which saw Corbyn emerge triumphant over his pro-People\u2019s Vote deputy, Tom Watson, to the intense anguish of remain backers.\n\nAmid this disquiet with the two main parties, who will benefit? The short answer is: the Brexit party. Nigel Farage\u2019s brand new successor-to-Ukip has formally existed for only a few weeks, but is topping polls at about 30% or more, and has unveiled dozens of candidates ranging from former Conservatives to businesspeople and an ex-Marxist.\n\nAs ever, Farage is presenting a message to the public that is both coherent and vehement \u2013 Brexit is being betrayed \u2013 as well as being distinctly light on details.\n\nFarage quit Ukip last year over the party\u2019s hard right, anti-Islam stance under Gerard Batten, and his new venture seems to have well and truly stolen Ukip\u2019s thunder \u2013 after intially strong poll results Ukip has slipped to below 5%, which if confirmed would usher in the party\u2019s likely end as a mainstream force. And remember, under Farage Ukip topped the UK\u2019s vote in 2014.\n\nIf, as some bill it, the European elections are seen as some sort of proxy second Brexit referendum, the coalescing of leave support around Farage\u2019s group could be an advantage when contrasted with the splits among remainers.\n\nCompeting for this vote will be the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, as well as Change UK \u2013 the new party set up by 11 former Labour and Tory MPs. Each of them are polling at close to 10%.\n\nWhat will it all mean come the results? No one really knows, beyond one thing \u2013 it\u2019s very unlikely to heal any divisions. Peter Walker, the Guardian\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Is Manfred the man? Photograph: Michele Tantussi/Getty Images\n\nGermany \u2013 Merkel\u2019s last stand\n\nThe European elections are perceived in Germany mainly as a vote on national affairs, as a small Bundestag election, so to speak. This year, it is a litmus test of whether Angela Merkel\u2019s grand coalition will be able to hang on through the full legislative period to 2021. Or whether it might collapse early.\n\nFor the first time in almost 20 years, Merkel will be absent from the campaign, airbrushed from posters and social media. The elections are the first big test for her successor as CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who must prove she can lead her party into battle. Poll numbers are weak; the party is nervous.\n\nFor the SPD, grudging junior coalition partner, the vote is all about whether to stick it out in government \u2013 a role that since 2013 has given it some executive power, at the expense of popularity. If the SPD clearly loses its support, it will be harder for them to stay in government. The left wing is pushing for the opposition role to sharpen the profile of the party there. The bar for the European elections is quite high. In the last election, the well-known leading candidate Martin Schulz, then president of the European parliament, gained more than six percentage points for his party \u2013 and presented a respectable result at 27.3%.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ballot boxer Photograph: David Hecker/EPA\n\nThe SPD is launching Katarina Barley as national top candidate this year. According to surveys, Barley is the best-known among the top candidates in Germany, ahead of leading AFD candidate J\u00f6rg Meuthen and Manfred Weber of the CSU-CDU, who wants to become president of the European commission. Only one in four knows him. It is a heavy burden for Weber that the rightwing populist AfD leaves the Union man behind in terms of popularity.\n\nFor the Greens, it is important to convert good poll results into electoral success. The party has been on the up for months; a decent European result will boost the party as it fights regional elections that offer the promise of coalition power.\n\nBig European issues are of little concern. Some voters tell campaigners they are concerned about dumping, about tax avoidance, copyright, security and the rise of rightwing populists. But most see this as just another national election, albeit one fought on a bigger stage.

At the end of April, the country held its third general election in under four years, a landmark vote that saw the ruling socialist workers\u2019 party (PSOE) win the most votes but fall short of a majority, the traditional People\u2019s party (PP) humiliated and the breakthrough of the far-right Vox party.\n\nThose results are likely to exert a significant influence on what happens on 26 May, when Spaniards vote in the European elections, but also in regional and municipal ones.\n\nThe PSOE will be hoping for a post-general election bounce that will see them win the vote and cement the party\u2019s place as the resurgent party of the European centre-left.\n\nEqually interesting will be what happens on the right. The advent of Vox, which won 24 seats in congress last month, pushed both the PP and the centre-right Citizens party further to the right as the three parties competed for voters.\n\nBut the move backfired \u2013 particularly for the PP. After his strategy of cosying up to Vox failed to pay off, the PP\u2019s leader, Pablo Casado, is trying to reclaim the centre-ground and has begun denouncing the party as a far-right outfit.\n\nCitizens, meanwhile, is doing its best to stake its claim to that centre-ground and to portray itself as the true party of opposition.\n\nVox is also recalibrating its approach. Although the party picked up 10.3% of the vote in April \u2013 wildly up on the 0.2% it took in the 2016 general election \u2013 it did not do as well as had been predicted.\n\nThe party, which has followed the populist tactic of favouring social media over traditional media, thinks the approach may have hurt its ability to reach older voters.\n\nMindful that the great majority of Spaniards are pro-European and still regard the country\u2019s entry into the EU as a landmark moment in the country\u2019s history, Vox is taking a different line to many of the continent\u2019s far-right parties.\n\n\u201cWe believe in Europe because we are Europe,\u201d says its European election manifesto.\n\nBut it says the EU is in crisis because it is on hock to \u201ccertain ideologies and political commitments that have seen \u2018the construction of a Europe\u2019 outside the true Europe\u201d.

Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nPoland \u2013 Gay rights and child protection\n\n\u201cHands off our children,\u201d the leader of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, intoned in March as the campaign for European parliamentary elections started.\n\nBut the declaration is proving uncomfortable. Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s intended target was the LGBT community. Awkwardly for Kaczy\u0144ski, it is the Catholic church, a great ally to the PiS, which has been accused of being a far greater threat to children than the gay community.\n\nSince it came to power in 2015, PiS has sought to rally its conservative base with sound and fury about attempts to introduce more liberal sexual education in Warsaw and other cities run by the opposition.\n\nIt seized on statements by the likes of Pawe\u0142 Rabiej, vice-president of Warsaw, who does not hide the fact that he is gay, who has said he is in favour of the legalisation of gay marriage and gay adoption in Poland. One PiS politician running for election, El\u017cbieta Kruk, vowed that Poland should be an LGBT-free land.\n\nIn another episode, an activist was arrested for hanging posters with an image of the Virgin Mary with a rainbow halo in a church in P\u0142ock. She faces two years in prison for insulting religious feelings.\n\nBut the moral onslaught did not change the poll ratings. And a backlash was brewing. Last weekend, Tomasz Sekielski, broadcast a film with fresh revelations about paedophilia in the Polish Catholic church.\n\nThe film accused the church in Poland of covering up cases of child sexual abuse by priests, and transferring perpetrators to other parishes. Almost 8 million people have seen it.\n\nThe ruling party appear to be floundering, dismissing the paedophile-priests as isolated cases while at the same time raising penalties for paedophilia to up to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe opposition promised a new commission to investigate paedophilia in the Polish church.\n\nAll of this is a prelude to national elections in the autumn. Defeat for PiS in May will damage its chances of maintaining its hold on government later in the year. A sudden threat from a new constellation on the far right could erode its popularity further.\n\nPoland waits with bated breath. Bartosz T.

But throughout my career I have faced significant challenges.\u201d\n\nHe talked about his childhood, how he had \u201cbeen blessed\u201d by being adopted and how much he owed his adoptive parents.\n\nHis father owned a fish processing business in Aberdeen that went bust, something the family blamed on the EU. \u201cIt was seeing my dad\u2019s dream die,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fishing industry has been devastated by the common fisheries policy. That did have an impact on me. It\u2019s definitely a factor because I owe so much to my parents. I feel in politics I have to stay true to my roots and my background.\u201d\n\nOf the pictures once on the wall of his ministerial office \u2013 including Lenin, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King \u2013 Gove said: \u201cI think that there\u2019s always an element of humour and irony in some of the pictures I had on my wall, as well as a reminder of the importance of making a difference.\u201d\n\nBrexit: top Tories would bring down any PM who backs no deal Read more\n\nGove admitted he was a huge fan of Game of Thrones. Asked who his favourite character was, he said, without missing a beat, Tyrion Lannister. \u201cHe\u2019s the character that stands back. He\u2019s the character who has an opportunity to reflect on some of the political currents that are moving around.\n\n\u201cBut also at critical moments, he is the character that provides an opportunity for forces to be rallied and victory to be secured.\u201d\n\nHe also admitted once saying Lannister was someone reviled throughout his life, thought by some to be a toxic figure and who led a small band of loyal followers. \u201cI think that people may draw their own conclusions [on why he liked the character] \u2026 I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to lead the witness.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a250b259e0019eac174963deb5367472281c3fa/521_165_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7c0e034766a9dea67b7c9776de609c60", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68fa1728ef761a07683be8425534445c4b1835ae/0_104_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b59e8d4301fd12b9f496ac1cfc2933f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2afe87311ceae4dea950c4ac19de8378288b09a3/0_1088_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8644d28a35c0581af79bde88ad5a45fb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcdd65d0a4e0debb70a9bc19ff18e6c94754bc11/0_187_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=204cbd31c204876554b8d85160ee96a7", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d3616297ad1a94961626daf37e40a75560b074f/0_113_3354_2013/master/3354.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f115549626f8867e84739fbc74111edb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d3616297ad1a94961626daf37e40a75560b074f/0_113_3354_2013/master/3354.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0508081b98457695de040a5937062c6a", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Conservatives%2CMichael+Gove%2CPolitics%2CCulture%2CGame+of+Thrones%2CUK+news%2CHay+festival"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d3616297ad1a94961626daf37e40a75560b074f/0_113_3354_2013/master/3354.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f115549626f8867e84739fbc74111edb", "date": "26/05/2019"}, "rank_50": {"title": "Why populists could struggle to capitalise on EU elections success", "text": "Populists have won nearly three in 10 seats in the European parliament, according to new analysis, which also shows how anti-establishment parties fell short of apocalyptic predictions.\n\nAnalysis shared with the Guardian reveals that populists, spanning the far right to the radical left, won 29% of seats in European elections, their best ever score, but not the populist wave some had predicted would upend the EU.\n\nMatthijs Rooduijn, a political sociologist at the University of Amsterdam, said populists had won 218 of the parliament\u2019s 751 seats. All kinds of populism were on the rise: left, right, as well as groups such as the Brexit party, which cannot be easily categorised.\n\n'Spectres of the past': Angela Merkel sounds alarm over antisemitism Read more\n\nPopulist success was heavily dependent on breakthroughs in just three countries beset by political volatility: the Brexit party in the UK, Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League in Italy, and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s radical-left France Unbowed.\n\nThese groups will remain divided in the European parliament, blunting their influence. But their greater numbers in Brussels and Strasbourg, combined with the deepening fragmentation of European politics, will make it harder for traditional parties to find a majority.\n\nIn the outgoing parliament, populists have 24% of seats, compared with 9% in 1999.\n\nThe rise of populism was driven not only by immigration, European integration and economic issues, Rooduijn said, but the narrative that an \u201cevil elite\u201d was in charge. \u201cThis evil elite can be a national elite, it can be Brussels elite or European elite.\u201d\n\nMany, but not all, populist parties are sceptical or hostile to the European project, he said. \u201cEuroscepticism is framed in a populist way, so it is about Brussels technocrats, who do not listen to ordinary citizens.\u201d\n\nRooduijn, working with his University of Amsterdam colleague Philipp Mendoza, analysed election results across the EU\u2019s 28 member states and matched them to the PopuList, an overview of populist parties compiled by political scientists and supported by the Guardian.\n\nThe European elections resulted in traditional centre-right and centre-left blocs losing their majority for the first time in the 40-year history of the directly elected parliament. Greens and liberals made striking gains, ending the cosy consensus of centre right and left.\n\nWhile populists could continue to grow, their fortunes could also change quickly, Rooduijn said. \u201cIt depends on the topics that are salient in the media, it depends on the performance of the leader, all these things matter a great deal and it can really lead to big shifts in success or losses over very short periods of time.\u201d\n\nHe predicted that the far right would continue to advance, because politics was focused on immigration and EU integration, while the far right was trying to frame action over the climate crisis as \u201csomething that the elite is doing to ordinary citizens\u201d.\n\nNon-populist politicians will dominate the next European parliament but will be forced to confront more opponents who paint them as an out-of-touch elite.\n\n\u201cMainstream parties in general are still struggling to deal with populism,\u201d Rooduijn said. \u201cIn the beginning they tried to ignore them, then they have tried to compete with their rhetoric [and] many mainstream right parties have moved towards the radical right; they have not become radical right, but they have become more strict on immigration, more sceptic on European integration.\u201d\n\nMacron was trying a different but \u201cdangerous\u201d strategy by becoming the \u201canti-populist\u201d, he said. \u201cIf the most important division within European politics becomes the \u2018anti-populists versus populist\u2019 movement, and the anti-populists will not be very successful any more, that will lead to the idea that the only real alternative is the populists.\u201d\n\nPopulist MEPs will remain divided between different groups in the European parliament, which will blunt their ability to secure senior posts and set an agenda.\n\nSalvini had hoped to create a \u201cLeague of Leagues\u201d that would become the third-largest group in the European parliament, leapfrogging the Eurosceptic British Conservatives\u2019 group, and the Liberals, who hold third and fourth place in the outgoing parliament.\n\nBut this looks unlikely. \u201cEven if [the populist far right] come together they will be divided on every issue,\u201d the political scientist Cas Mudde told a recent event in Brussels.\n\nThe Salvini alliance would unite League MEPs with Marine Le Pen\u2019s National Rally and Alternative for Germany. But hopes of a far-right supergroup have suffered a setback after the Danish People\u2019s party haemorrhaged votes and Geert Wilders\u2019 Freedom party in the Netherlands lost all its seats.\n\nAnother member, Austria\u2019s far-right Freedom party, was hit by a modest decline in its vote after a corruption scandal forced its leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, to resign, precipitating the collapse of government and removal of the chancellor.\n\nMudde said the Austrian scandal was likely to have a bigger impact on changing politicians\u2019 calculations, rather than voters. \u201cIt will make other parties look again at their local far-right party and think: \u2018Should I really make a coalition with them, if I only get a few seats extra?\u2019 It makes the far right a little bit more of a liability again.\u201d\n\nNigel Farage, whose Brexit party is one of the biggest national parties in the European parliament, hopes to resuscitate his Eurosceptic group, Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy, in which he is allied to Italy\u2019s Five Star Movement. He has previously ruled out working with Le Pen.\n\nPoland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party is expected to remain allied to British Tories in the European Conservatives and Reformists group.\n\nViktor Orb\u00e1n, currently suspended from the centre-right European People\u2019s party, pending an investigation, has not revealed whether he intends to quit and join forces with the far right.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9776f05da147754fb1739ef7c5b07150ab1d86d1/0_248_5386_3232/master/5386.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9ca16e66b22658fca2a1369a764fa1bb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb80ccb63987edc02a01a888e3a1d1869f72d17d/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48590b43434cd66406948a74246b8595", "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/badges/c28778c35d31ca0ca43e82756597dec1/eu_election.svg", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/641e173f3e491b2e4a57d4cbc17ff2313bb35c35/0_196_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=125779f25df1eb26b07b54469122a99e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb80ccb63987edc02a01a888e3a1d1869f72d17d/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b0b41faae1da27a810edded12f36eaf0", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd4cb2b03365b7059a19f66e531d995b355025b3/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f26ab55e93b648e8b90c2837d40376fb", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/851dc2e890522b19b7325caa16615e202a62ab04/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=30f6a230533e7e0cf664f20f636de80c", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+parliamentary+elections+2019%2CEuropean+elections%2CWorld+news%2CMatteo+Salvini%2CItaly%2CFrance%2CMarine+Le+Pen%2CAlternative+f%C3%BCr+Deutschland+%28AfD%29%2CAustria%2CBrexit+party%2CDenmark%2CNetherlands"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb80ccb63987edc02a01a888e3a1d1869f72d17d/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=48590b43434cd66406948a74246b8595", "date": "28/05/2019"}, "rank_29": {"title": "Corbyn\u2019s destructive ambiguity on Brexit has failed | William Keegan", "text": "I am told that, shortly before the elections for the European parliament, Jeremy Corbyn was flirting with the idea of being less hostile towards the Remain campaign. Even he could read the opinion polls. However, according to my informant, he was immediately sat upon by his spin doctor, Seumas Milne, and other members of the politburo of what passes for the modern Labour party.\n\nThe policy of so-called \u201cconstructive ambiguity\u201d remained in place, with all too predictable results at the polls. This approach was tested to destruction, thereby proving what had been obvious for some time: that it was, in truth, a policy of destructive ambiguity.\n\nSo what do Milne and his close colleagues do? They terminate the party membership of the previously influential Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell, for admitting \u2013 perhaps even boasting \u2013 that, as a staunch Remainer, he had, like many of us, voted Lib Dem.\n\nThings have come to a pretty pass when that prominent supporter of much that Labour wishes to achieve, the journalist and broadcaster Paul Mason, calls for the removal of Corbyn\u2019s inner politburo, who have fomented their leader\u2019s worst Eurosceptical instincts, and achieved such an electoral disaster. Apart from anything else, with the present Conservative government an international laughing stock, it is a remarkable achievement to have become such a self-destructive opposition.\n\nI could hardly agree more with Mason\u2019s call for Labour to \u201cscrap Brexit and rebuild Britain instead\u201d. In which context, people who have been asking me \u201cwhere is Gordon Brown?\u201d should be pleased to hear that he is now playing a prominent role in the counterattack on that notorious snake-oil salesman, the egregious Nigel Farage.\n\nBrown takes Farage seriously. He speaks of \u201ca new battle for Britain\u201d: \u201cThis is a battle against intolerance, prejudice, xenophobia and the manufacture of distrust and disunity.\u201d Incidentally, while cynically continuing to draw an income from the European parliament, Farage, with a characteristic mixture of ignorance and prejudice, proposes to ban university courses in European studies.\n\nI wonder if Lavery is aware that, in his contempt for intellectuals, he is sneering at great Labour figures of the past\n\nLike Corbyn\u2019s disappointed disciple Mason, Brown recognises that, while trying to disabuse the \u201cleft behind\u201d of the fantasy that Brexit would mysteriously improve their lot, Labour must address \u201cthe fears surrounding immigration, sovereignty, the state of our towns \u2026 and Britain\u2019s now rampant poverty and inequality\u201d.\n\nNow, the good news about the British EU election result \u2013 the counterpart of the Labour party\u2019s humiliation \u2013 was that the combined vote of all the Remain parties easily outshone the Brexit vote. Tom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, and Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, have been espousing the cause of another referendum for some time, and have now been joined by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry.\n\nBut, according to the Labour party\u2019s chair, Ian Lavery \u2013 another member of the politburo \u2013 those of us who believe the country should have another look at the prospect of Brexit are \u201cleftwing intellectuals\u201d sneering at \u201cordinary people\u201d.\n\nOh dear. I wonder if Lavery is aware that, in his contempt for intellectuals, he is sneering at the memory of, among many others, such great Labour figures of the past as Sir Stafford Cripps, Hugh Dalton, Hugh Gaitskell, Tony Crosland, Michael Foot, Denis Healey \u2013 I could go on. Moreover, the Stalinists and Trotskyists who are said to be such influences on Corbyn\u2019s politburo liked to think of themselves as intellectuals.\n\nMeanwhile, we have a Conservative party in power whose candidates for the succession to Theresa May are, with honourable exceptions such as Philip Hammond, making fools of themselves in competing to out-Farage Farage by championing the cause of any kind of Brexit \u2013 to the extent, in some cases, of being prepared to leave the EU on 31 October \u201cwithout a deal\u201d.\n\nSuch an outcome \u2013 involving the termination of decades of regulatory agreements and contracts, and chaos at the docks and airports \u2013 would almost certainly bring the economy close to a halt, and threaten goodness knows what in the streets.\n\nMinisters talk of \u201cdelivering Brexit\u201d as if it were as simple as delivering groceries. If they delivered a so-called \u201chard Brexit\u201d, they would foul up the delivery of many staple requirements.

Rather than Manfred Weber, the lead candidate, or Spitzenkandidat of the biggest political group in the European parliament, the centre-right European People\u2019s Party (EPP), Ursula von der Leyen, the German minister of defence was announced as the nominee. As some celebrated (finally) the promotion of a woman to the most powerful EU position, others (rightly) criticised her nomination for rendering the European electorate irrelevant in the process.\n\n'Not the best candidate': Germans condemn own choice for top EU job Read more\n\nIn political science, European elections are referred to as \u201csecond-order\u201d elections, as opposed to \u201cfirst-order\u201d elections, which determine national governments. In fact, European elections don\u2019t even determine the EU\u2019s \u201cgovernment\u201d, which is constituted by the executive body, the European commission and the European council, which is made up of the heads of government of the member states.\n\nIn 2014, to make European elections a bit more relevant, or \u201cfirst-order\u201d, the largest political groups in the European parliament fielded their so-called Spitzenkandidaten or \u201clead candidates\u201d for the commission presidency. Despite opposition from heads of government, notably Britain\u2019s David Cameron and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Juncker, the candidate put up by the EPP, which won most seats in the 2014 elections, was voted president of the European commission for the 2014 to 2019 term.\n\nFive years on, this minimal attempt to give European voters more of a role in the EU\u2019s governance has been abandoned in a return to the traditional horse-trading between national governments over the top jobs. Weber, Spitzenkandidat of the EPP, was opposed within both the European council and parliament, while Frans Timmermans, the lead candidate of the Socialists & Democrats (S&D), was rejected by leaders of the central and east European member states as well as the EPP.\n\nInstead, government leaders came up with Von der Leyen, a candidate no one expected, and who had played no role in the European elections. As a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she is supposed to represent the EPP, the overall winner of the European elections.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Josep Borrell, the council\u2019s nominee for the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, was fined \u20ac30,000 for insider trading last year.\u2019 Photograph: St\u00e9phanie Lecocq/EPA\n\nDespite Von der Leyen being a Merkel ally, the German chancellor had to abstain in the European council vote because her coalition partner, the Social Democratic party (SPD), opposed the nomination. In fact, only a third of Germans believe Von der Leyen is a good candidate for the powerful Brussels position. A majority (56%) think otherwise. This should come as no surprise, as she is currently under fire for her performance as minister of defence and is the second-most unpopular minister in an overall very unpopular German federal government.\n\nBut Von der Leyen is not the only candidate for a top EU position with no direct relation to the European elections. Nor is she the worst. Spanish foreign minister Josep Borrell, the council\u2019s nominee for the EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, was forced to resign as president of the European University Institute (EUI) over a conflict of interest in 2012, and faced calls to resign from the government after being fined \u20ac30,000 for insider trading last year. His undiplomatic statements about American independence or Catalan separatism are right up there with Donald Trump\u2019s. On the former, for example, he said: \u201call they (Americans) had to do was kill four Indians, but apart from that it was very easy.\u201d\n\nCompared to Borrell, Christine Lagarde, currently managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the nominee for president of the European Central Bank (ECB), is squeaky clean. She \u201conly\u201d has a conviction for failing to challenge the state arbitration payout to a friend of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, her then boss.\n\nShould the European parliament ratify the European council\u2019s nominations in a vote on Tuesday, it will officially kill off the Spitzenkandidaten system. To be clear, this process was always an insider\u2019s solution to an insider\u2019s problem, namely the frustration of MEPs over their marginal role within the EU, rather than a true solution to the rightly maligned \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d exemplified by the second-order status of European elections. Moreover, its top candidate, EPP Spitzenkandidat Weber, has done more than almost anyone to undermine the foundations of the European project by enabling Orb\u00e1n to create an authoritarian state while remaining within Europe\u2019s so-called \u201ccommunity of values\u201d.\n\nIn essence, the failure of the Spitzenkandidaten system is a logical consequence of the withdrawal of most of Europe\u2019s national leaders in the wake of the great recession. Confronted with the unforeseen realities of the eurozone, they chose short-term national interests over long-time proclaimed European solidarity. From Berlin to The Hague they have rejected French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s reform proposal, which would further centralise governance of the eurozone, and instead called for less rather than more EU.\n\nThe 2019 European election results were hailed as a setback for populists, who had \u201cgained votes, but lost initiative,\u201d while the highest turnout in 20 years was celebrated as a victory for democracy. Somewhat overstating his case, the EPP lead candidate, Weber, declared that Europeans had \u201cused their right to vote to decide about the future of Europe and that gives the European parliament much more credibility and legitimacy for the future of the continent\u201d.\n\nThe Guardian view on Europe\u2019s top jobs: the good, the bad and the compromise | Editorial Read more\n\nOne month later, the European council has quashed this short-lived optimism for EU democracy. The governments\u2019 motley crew of nominees shows not only a stunning disregard for the Spitzenkandidaten process but also for the European voter. They undid the little progress the European elections made, instead boosting Euroscepticism and weakening voter participation. For the sake of its own relevance as well as that of European elections, the European parliament should reject the nominees and propose its own list of candidates, who defend not only the interests of the European institutions but also those of liberal democracy.\n\n\u2022 This article was corrected on 16 July 2019 to clarify the role of the European council and to make clear that Josep Borrell did not resign from the board of energy group Abengoa.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e6407653e003ad99e170445ed2072c4e824229/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8dc407ec6ae11ca417c4d3ce8bcf0acd", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e6407653e003ad99e170445ed2072c4e824229/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2a8f2742745c2540c0dab2b03aeef169", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=European+Union%2CJean-Claude+Juncker%2CEurope%2CEuropean+commission%2CChristine+Lagarde", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d4603d047499c326e690a57cf6c41d5c3b5231/0_0_3252_1951/master/3252.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4974db3278781c2d7e53a4066a79f1c6", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84692281f0d48d67c1a2c1a0c8f37a5ff76f8a4d/0_49_1968_1181/master/1968.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c85eeae84186b4f790151641ed85901", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ca226ddf8fb960e15a552841460ed9a719e9485/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=77b1c03473502db2eb5a532bcce4192f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe3ce5411249888cb3606cb68d1b9f39b9a1045/0_91_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dfcd290a788e18f5365abf0bcdd0f933", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54feb8482bfe266d1e9059a4d767099ef3dd6269/0_92_5639_3383/master/5639.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6116df800a35ecc52231f03485b89605"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2e6407653e003ad99e170445ed2072c4e824229/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2a8f2742745c2540c0dab2b03aeef169", "date": "15/07/2019"}, "rank_25": {"title": "Did Liverpool\u2019s Sun boycott result in a remain vote? It\u2019s a neat, if flawed, theory | Roy Greenslade", "text": "No one surely believes that when a newspaper tells its readers ahead of an election how to vote they simply do as they are told. There is no evidence whatsoever to show a direct correlation between what is published and what happens at the ballot box.\n\nThe Sun faces major job cuts as publisher seeks to slash costs Read more\n\nInstead, media academics who have tried to divine the political impact of the press during elections, particularly the populist tabloid variety, have found it necessary to untangle a complex web of influences in order to explain why people voted as they did.\n\nNow, as if proving a positive wasn\u2019t difficult enough, two academics have sought to prove a negative. Rather than arguing that readers of the Sun voted leave on the basis of their paper\u2019s passionate pro-Brexit campaign, they want us to believe that not reading the paper contributed to a pro-European Union vote.\n\nFlorian Foos and Daniel Bischof have produced research that claims that Euroscepticism in Liverpool gradually subsided during the course of the city\u2019s 30-year boycott of the Sun. Therefore, they claim, it was the absence of the Sun that resulted in a pronounced switch by Liverpudlians in favour of remaining in the EU.\n\nFoos, an assistant professor in political behaviour at the London School of Economics, and Bischof, a senior political science researcher at Zurich University, do have the good grace to call their approach \u201cquasi-experimental\u201d. So, clearly, they know they are going out on a limb.\n\nBefore I saw off their branch, here\u2019s the gist of the argument. After the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989, in which 96 Liverpool football fans died in a crush, the Sun wrongly accused the fans of being responsible for the deaths. It prompted many people on Merseyside to stop buying what was, and is, Britain\u2019s best-selling daily. Spontaneous outrage turned into a long-term boycott. With several newsagents refusing to stock the Sun, it is estimated that sales fell by more than 40,000 a day and never recovered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Liverpool fans hold up a mosaic spelling out the words The Truth \u2013 referencing the Sun\u2019s post-Hillsborough headline \u2013 at Anfield in 2007. Photograph: Dave Thompson/AP\n\nSome Sun boycotters stopped reading a paper altogether. Most of the others, according to the research, switched to the Daily Mirror \u2013 the only one of the popular papers to support Britain\u2019s EU membership. In other words, they were relieved from the relentless anti-EU agenda of the Sun from the 1990s onwards and subsequently, following the opening proceedings for the referendum in 2015, its pro-Brexit propaganda.\n\nAccording to Foos and Bischof, prior to Hillsborough the people of Liverpool, and the wider region of Merseyside, were generally Eurosceptic. Indeed, they were more anti-EU than 21 English counties with similar working-class demographics.\n\nYet in their analysis of the 2016 referendum voting pattern, they found that residents in the city of Liverpool \u201cvoted significantly more remain than the rest of England\u201d (58.2% in fact) while those across Merseyside as a whole showed \u201ca slight edge for remain\u201d. The Merseyside vote was 51% to 49% in favour of staying in the EU.\n\nIn their view, this outcome suggested it was the boycott of the Eurosceptic Sun that \u201cled to a decrease of Euroscepticism in Merseyside, which we estimate to amount to around 11 percentage-points\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s a bit of a leap of faith. They cannot be certain that the non-Sun factor was the major determinant of the pro-EU vote in Liverpool. Note, for instance, that neighbouring Manchester, where no Sun boycott took place, voted 60.4% remain.\n\nMoreover, their notion that switching to the pro-EU Mirror could have made a difference is entirely nonsensical. As the senior editorial staff of the Mirror privately conceded, once the referendum was called they played down their once wholehearted support for the EU precisely because their readership was so skewed towards Brexit. A large slice of the Mirror\u2019s audience voted leave.\n\nBut I do think the study indicates the possibility that a non-Sun diet might have had some influence on the vote. Although the academics only touched on it, I imagine that such was the depth of the city\u2019s antipathy to the Sun and all it stood for that Liverpudlians were motivated to vote against anything it advocated.\n\nFoos and Bischof also argue that their study \u201cshows that sustained media campaigns on emerging issues can have large, lasting, and ultimately, consequential effects on public opinion, and public policy\u201d. While I\u2019m uncertain about whether they have proved that with this particular study, I\u2019m with them on the general point.\n\nExcluding the Sun from our festival isn\u2019t censorship, it\u2019s Hillsborough solidarity | Christine Howard Read more\n\nNewspaper campaigns succeed by repetition over a prolonged period. Influence on public opinion takes place over years rather than as the result of a single political intervention. Turning that on its head, as the authors do, it could therefore be argued that the failure to be subjected to such a campaign also has an effect. Maybe, maybe not. This study doesn\u2019t prove their argument but it\u2019s an interesting case that suggests we should examine the lasting impact of the worldview of newspapers.\n\n\u2022 Roy Greenslade is professor of journalism at City University and a Guardian columnist", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b517a23ce145c73aec6800e93e51ca4fd4f181e/0_48_2428_1458/master/2428.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8c75c695a7cd800c7ec6242e5497f51e", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Liverpool%2CUK+news%2CThe+Sun%2CNewspapers%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CNational+newspapers%2CMedia%2CHillsborough+disaster%2CLiverpool%2CBrexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CPolitics", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1344d81a356cec4998b8167b84420ae8cc08f71/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=38dea516019db395fde8d5b5ae8f559c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Roy-Greenslade,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15b48b8e4b6744294489e71d4bfe931f", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1344d81a356cec4998b8167b84420ae8cc08f71/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1351b5d840a35bdafb9713b3d30d6d94"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1344d81a356cec4998b8167b84420ae8cc08f71/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=38dea516019db395fde8d5b5ae8f559c", "date": "27/08/2019"}, "rank_61": {"title": "Labour has travelled a long way from the first European referendum", "text": "My friend Tom McGuinness, who will be known to many as the lead guitarist in Manfred Mann (now the Manfreds), recently spotted a most moving Churchill quote on a D-Day memorial in Normandy. \u201cMen will be proud to say \u2018I am a European\u2019. We hope to see a day when men of every country will think as much of being a European as of being from their native country.\u201d\n\nHaving at one stage early in the second world war proposed a union between Britain and France, the great man cooled on the idea. Later he called for a United States of Europe, but he was not in favour of our joining. Nor was Clement Attlee, Labour prime minister from 1945 to 1951. As for Attlee\u2019s successor as Labour leader, Hugh Gaitskell, he was passionately against it, arguing that it would be an insult to \u201ca thousand years of history\u201d.\n\nBut it was in reaction to a thousand years of European history, and all the conflict between European nations, that the concept of a European union evolved. In particular the 1914-18 and 1939-45 wars were quite enough for enlightened European leaders to come together and try to unite previously warring nations by economic means.\n\nUnlike Gaitskell, whom I admired for other reasons but certainly not for his Euroscepticism, the two Harolds \u2013 Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963, and Wilson, Labour prime minister 1964-70 and 1974-76 \u2013 wanted us to join what was known in those days as the European Economic Community, or the \u201ccommon market\u201d. Quite apart from pursuing the principal objective of \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d, the continental economies were faring better economically.\n\nMacmillan is celebrated for his \u201cwind of change\u201d speech about Africa in the early 1960s; however, for the British empire \u2013 and Gaitskell\u2019s \u201cthousand years\u201d \u2013 the winds of change had blown in 1956 with the Suez fiasco. But General de Gaulle vetoed both Macmillan\u2019s and Wilson\u2019s applications to join, and it was not until 1973 that we finally succeeded under Conservative prime minister Edward Heath.\n\nHere we come to uncanny parallels, and differences, between then and now. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn has finally come round, with a lot of \u201cifs\u201d and \u201cbuts\u201d, to the idea that there may have to be a second referendum \u2013 or third, if you include the one in 1975. But he claims to be emulating Harold Wilson in 1975 in saying he himself will stay out of it.\n\nThe referendum was called to resolve issues within the Tory party: instead it brought us the biggest crisis since Suez\n\nWell: up to a point. As the head of Wilson\u2019s policy unit, Lord Donoughue, and his principal private secretary, Ken Stowe, confirmed, Wilson had been in favour of our membership of the European community since 1965. The author of The Official History of Britain and the European Community, Stephen Wall, concluded that Wilson \u201chad seen that the only way to win a decisive victory over the anti-Marketeers in the Labour party was to go beyond the party to the country at large\u201d.\n\nBefore the 1975 referendum there was a rather more successful \u201crenegotiation\u201d than took place before the 2016 referendum. This was under the then foreign secretary, James Callaghan, and his minister of state Roy Hattersley. At the beginning of it, Wilson told Hattersley that his task was to keep Callaghan, who was going to take a hard line in the talks, \u201conside\u201d to achieve a successful outcome.\n\nThe difference now is that Corbyn is a notorious Eurosceptic. The irony is that his political mentor, Tony Benn, may have been a Eurosceptic, but Benn\u2019s son Hilary is a Europhile, whereas Corbyn is stuck in a Eurosceptical timewarp.\n\nWilson was rather more successful than David Cameron. Cameron may claim till the cows come home that he had to call a referendum because the EU was a burning issue; but the truth is that it was only a burning issue within the Tory party and not even in the top 10 of the broader electorate\u2019s concerns. The referendum was called in order to resolve issues within his party: instead it aggravated them and brought us the biggest national crisis since Suez.\n\nIn his memoirs Cameron makes a pathetic attempt to claim that his and George Osborne\u2019s austerity programme was not only necessary but successful. It was neither; what it achieved was economic and social discontent that proved a major factor behind the protest vote that the referendum became.\n\nWe now have the worst prime minister in living memory making a fool of himself and the country in painful efforts to patch up some kind of \u201cdeal\u201d. The best deal is what we already enjoy: membership of the customs union and the single market, while being exempt from the deflation-bias of the eurozone.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/William-Keegan,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=acd3c8f38303a4eff3a5f907c9fe3d4d", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Economics%2CBrexit%2CHarold+Wilson%2CJeremy+Corbyn%2CLabour%2CEuropean+Union%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66bd00313d926c3b7dfef065751c032dea2a3ea/0_41_3576_2146/master/3576.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0afed85670683f6cee54df7f64d4d5e5", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66bd00313d926c3b7dfef065751c032dea2a3ea/0_41_3576_2146/master/3576.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bd1b890f95f2a819d13fcbaef85fe787"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66bd00313d926c3b7dfef065751c032dea2a3ea/0_41_3576_2146/master/3576.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0afed85670683f6cee54df7f64d4d5e5", "date": "22/09/2019"}, "rank_189": {"title": "Brexit explained: how it happened and what comes next", "text": "How did we get here?\n\nWhere to start? There\u2019s geography: Britain is an island, and has been since geologically Brexiting from the continent 8,000 years ago. And history: unlike most of western Europe, it has not spent the past few centuries as a battlefield. Its history, rather, is global and imperial.\n\nThat, plus second world war heroics, has given it a profound sense of exceptionalism, reinforced by relative economic success and an overwhelmingly Eurosceptic popular press that adores dripping corrosive untruths about Brussels.\n\nAll this eventually combined to create the impression that the EU was essentially an anti-British plot: something that was somehow done to us. Hardline Tory Euroscepticism emerged with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Bruges speech of 1988, hounded the party into opposition in the 1990s, and returned with a vengeance once Conservative rule was restored in 2010.\n\nAmid the bitter fallout of the financial crash, mounting public concern over immigration and a political threat from the right in the form of Nigel Farage\u2019s anti-EU Ukip party led David Cameron to promise an in-out Brexit referendum if he won the 2015 election.\n\nA largely populist, emotive and evidence-free campaign with the inspired slogan \u201cTake back control\u201d carried the day, with voters motivated by a wide range of factors opting by 52% to 48% in favour of the UK leaving the EU.\n\nThree years of exhausting stalemate set in, as parliament refused to muster a majority in favour of a withdrawal deal mired in uncertainty chiefly over the future status of Northern Ireland.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar meets Boris Johnson in October 2019. Photograph: Noel Mullen/EPA\n\nSo what broke the deadlock?\n\nIn short, a meeting in a wedding venue in the Wirral on a cold day in October 2019.\n\nBoris Johnson and Irish premier Leo Varadkar broke the impasse with an agreement on what to do about the tricky land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThis frontier had become a 300-mile stumbling block for Theresa May, who was unable to broker an agreement on how to take Northern Ireland out of the EU without reinstating unworkable \u2013 and unpalatable \u2013 border checks.\n\nJohnson and Varadkar essentially agreed to shift the border checks to between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nThe deal is not popular in Northern Ireland. But it is one that commands the support of the Conservative party and its 80-strong majority. So, after it was approved by MPs in December and is ratified in the European parliament and Westminster later this week, it will bring the final curtain down on 47 years of EU membership at 11pm on 31 January.\n\nSo is the UK out of the EU?\n\n\u201cYes, but\u201d. At the stroke of 11pm on 31 January (midnight in Brussels), the UK ceases to be a member of the EU. The divorce is sealed. The only way back is an application to rejoin.\n\nBut many people may not notice the difference, as the UK enters an 11-month transition period to allow time to negotiate a new relationship. That means staying in the EU single market, its customs union and paying into its budget. British citizens can continue to live, work, study and retire to the EU, while EU27 nationals enjoy those reciprocal rights in the UK.\n\nA more significant moment could be 1 January 2021, the UK\u2019s first day outside EU rules. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, that day could be delayed until 2022 or 2023, but Johnson has ruled out any extension of the transition period.\n\nSo what actually changes on Friday?\n\nLife will carry on as normal for individuals with one key change \u2013 UK citizens, from 11pm, will no longer be EU citizens.\n\nBritish passport holders will continue to be able to travel and work in the EU because the country remains in the single market for the transition period up to 31 December and the freedom of movement of goods, people, services and capital over borders applies until then.\n\nThe main change is legal and institutional. The article 50 process is over and non-reversible. Friday is the point of no return to the EU.\n\nThe UK will continue to follow EU rules, but have no say in making them. British ministers will play no part in the EU law-making process. The prime minister will cease attending EU summits to set the bloc\u2019s priorities.\n\nThe UK\u2019s 73 MEPs will be sent home, with one of the parliament\u2019s union jacks dispatched to the EU-funded House of History. The last UK commissioner, Julian King, has already said goodbye to Brussels. The EU will move on without Britain.\n\nOver 47 years, British governments cheered liberal economic policies (above all the single market), promoted EU enlargement, invented regional policy subsidies for poorer regions, pushed reform of fisheries and farming, watered down some environmental protection laws (and championed others), while avoiding the euro and the Schengen passport-free zone.\n\nThe UK had \u201cthe best possible world\u201d, concluded one veteran French diplomat. Now it\u2019s gone.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Brexiters have campaigned for Big Ben to chime as the UK leaves the EU. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA\n\nAnd how is the country planning to mark it?\n\nAfter almost half a century of membership, the departure from the EU is a historic event. But the prime minister has to be careful about not deepening the divisions in the country by being too celebratory and has instead chosen a series of toned-down events to mark the occasion.\n\nInstead of Big Ben chiming out as the UK officially leaves at 11pm on Friday, a clock counting down be projected on to No 10 Downing Street.\n\nAnd an effort to convey the Tory party\u2019s commitment to \u201clevelling up\u201d the country, a special cabinet meeting will be head in an as-yet-undisclosed location in the north of England.\n\nThe union jack will fly from all flagpoles in Parliament Square but there will be no emblematic lowering of the EU flag.\n\nA commemorative Brexit 50p coin with the words \u201cpeace, prosperity and friendship with all nations\u201d will come into circulation. New stamps marking the occasion are also in the pipeline.\n\nFarage and the Leave Means Leave campaign are hosting a party for the countdown in Parliament Square, with Brexiters encouraged to go in fancy dress.\n\nThere is no official wake for remainers but Guardian readers have shared their private plans to mark the momentous day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lorries queue near Dover in a rehearsal for a no-deal Brexit. Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nThere is a set timetable for the year with negotiations expected to formally kick off after 25 February.\n\nBy 1 July there must be a deal on fisheries and a UK decision on whether to ask for an extension to the transition period.\n\nJohnson has urged Brussels to fast-track trade talks, but the EU moves at its own pace. Draft negotiating mandates are due to be produced by 1 February and EU ministers are expected to approve a mandate for the chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on 25 February, allowing formal talks to begin soon after.\n\nThese talks will be unprecedented, and could cover a vast sweep of policies, including trade, security, foreign affairs, data, fisheries, cultural-educational ties and much more.\n\nHowever, with just 11 months to negotiate, the chances are there will only be a \u201cbare bones\u201d deal likely covering trade, fisheries and security. If that is the case, then, at the end of 2020, there will be a lot of unfinished business. Differing aspirations for the trade talks have raised the prospect of a new no-deal scenario at the end of this year.\n\nLeaving the transition period without a trade deal would not lead to the major diplomatic bust-up that failure on the Brexit withdrawal agreement would have done.\n\nIt would have huge domestic consequences, however, with representatives of the car industry, hospitals, agriculture and directors already expressing alarm over Sajid Javid\u2019s declaration that the UK will not follow EU rules, which will cause hold-ups in Dover and Calais and possibly lead to businesses quitting the country.\n\nIn the absence of a deal, the earlier accord on citizens\u2019 rights, money and the Irish border remains intact.\n\nThe special arrangements that apply in Northern Ireland will kick in, deal or no deal.\n\nBoth sides would brace themselves for the economic shock of trading on World Trade Organization terms, an outcome that is more damaging for the UK. But talks would roll on.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The UK and EU have committed to negotiating a new framework for deciding fishing rights by 1 July. Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nWhat are the big issues at stake here?\n\nTop of the list is a trade deal to ensure the tariff and quota-free flow of goods between the EU and UK. But the EU will only agree to zero tariffs and zero quotas if the UK pledges zero dumping \u2013 that is, not lowering social and environmental standards to outcompete the EU.\n\nNegotiators will almost certainly clash over the EU\u2019s refusal to bring services into the trade deal, leaving the City of London reliant on a patchwork of market access agreements that can be withdrawn at any moment.\n\nAnother early fight will be over fish, as the EU seeks to link goods trade to maintaining the status quo on access to British waters, a demand seen as outrageous in London.\n\nThe non-trade topics sound easier, but are full of political landmines. For instance, agreeing a replacement for the European arrest warrant will require Germany to change its constitution. The UK will struggle to achieve the historic first of securing outside access to some EU crime-fighting databases.\n\nWhat will happen to the economy?\n\nIt depends who you ask. In the short term, much of the risk seems to have been priced in, at least on currency markets, where sterling still languishes compared to where it was in June 2016. The stock market is well ahead.\n\nA slightly more certain outlook could allow business investment to recover, after years of lagging behind Britain\u2019s G7 peers. But against that must be weighed the unpredictability of the looming trade talks.\n\nWhat does Europe think about the big Brexit moment?\n\nThe EU has always expressed regret at Britain\u2019s decision to leave, repeating as long as legally possible throughout the Brexit process that the door was still open should the UK change its mind and, more recently, that it could always reapply after leaving.\n\nBut the bloc has also robustly defended its interests, in particular the integrity of the single market, insisting, with unexpected unanimity, that Britain could not \u201chave its cake and eat it\u201d by retaining the benefits of EU membership while diverging from its rules.\n\nFrustration mounted at what the EU27 saw as the UK\u2019s reluctance to accept the real-world consequences of the vote to leave, its inability to agree on what kind of Brexit it wanted, and of course the long months of parliamentary psychodrama and paralysis that ensued.\n\nSome countries (France) have taken a much tougher line than others; some (the Netherlands, Denmark) will suffer much more from a no-trade-deal Brexit. But the EU27 should maintain their unity during the future relationship talks: however much of a blow a hard Brexit may be, a weakened single market is a far more damaging prospect.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest British people and others wave EU and Spanish flags as they protest against Brexit in Malaga in September 2019. Photograph: Jorge Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat does it all mean for Britons in Europe\u2026\n\nNo one yet fully knows; much remains to be negotiated. The withdrawal agreement secures British citizens\u2019 basic rights to live and work within their EU host countries, a broadly similar post-Brexit status in each country, and EU-wide coordination on reciprocal healthcare and social security.\n\nDuring the 11-month transition period, because the UK will remain in the single market, Britons will retain the freedom to move within the EU as before. After it ends they will have the right \u2013 providing they register, or in some countries apply, within a given time limit \u2013 to stay and, after a time, seek permanent residence.\n\nBut when the UK leaves the single market after transition, certain rights will fall away, including freedom of movement. This is a major blow for the 80% of UK citizens on the continent who are of working age or younger; they fought hard to lock free movement into the withdrawal agreement, but the EU decided this should be part of the trade talks.\n\nSome rights within the gift of the UK are not yet assured either, such as home fees for British students on the continent who wish to study in the UK, and family reunification rights for Britons returning to the UK with EU family members.\n\n...and for Europeans in Britain?\n\nMany British voters who were passionate about staying in the EU will be feeling upset and emotional at 11pm on 31 January. While life goes on as normal in general, it is the point of no return and from 1 February British citizens will no longer be EU citizens.\n\nBut for EU nationals in the UK the moment will cast a long shadow of material consequence. While the government has given assurances that they will not face deportation or loss of social or employment rights, the bond of trust with the government is weak, not least because of the Windrush scandal.\n\nAnd for the rest of the world?\n\nAlthough it will certainly affect the UK more than the EU in almost every respect, Brexit will undoubtedly weaken the EU economically and politically. Britain was the EU\u2019s second-biggest economy, a major net budget contributor, key military force and one of the bloc\u2019s two nuclear powers and permanent UN security council members.\n\nThe EU\u2019s institutions may have withstood the test of Brexit better than expected so far, and support for the EU among its citizens has generally increased. Brexit has also proved a salutary lesson, with almost all the bloc\u2019s nationalist and Eurosceptic parties dropping promises to follow the UK\u2019s example.\n\nBut the UK\u2019s departure has distracted attention from a number of other big and urgent problems, including the climate crisis, and settling on the new relationship is also likely to be a messy and debilitating process. Longer term, in the balance of global powers a smaller, fractured Europe is obviously a weaker Europe.\n\nIn the face of an aggressive China and an increasingly protectionist and unpredictable US, the EU will need to be significantly tougher, with a centralised foreign policy and stronger rules ensuring European companies can compete with overseas rivals. Brexit makes that imperative even more urgent.\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/648b961eff3a94ebdd61403b03a58b3e5d60711c/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=640022ccbb64d7d4540bc7d09c3658a3", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07219a7aa5c9acfc6bf55ed3e87e1a9e00250e93/0_96_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=43d8545ff3f51a6d4281a607a756ba2c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be2bfe2d0cb3415f79c012387fa8366cbf70bf4/0_110_2967_1781/master/2967.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1de7f184d4853cf6293fd15d65423fc5", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df55d759134efd2d24079305c65c988f4af21f36/0_0_5568_3712/master/5568.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f709c4b3abafdc859becb11205bf7481", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Politics%2CBrexit%2CUK+news%2CEuropean+Union%2CEurope", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e31b408ff71bf6c9a2179d674e46f30078afc97/0_68_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc09fdae5a1230cad71411b0c13ab179", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e31b408ff71bf6c9a2179d674e46f30078afc97/0_75_2090_1254/master/2090.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1afee5583e7d7bffdfed417fc9165dd6", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01d5bcd6f963287ef83f972512df9c46b40cde33/0_307_4690_2814/master/4690.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=01cdf8a99ce7a174baa70089d6efd249"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e31b408ff71bf6c9a2179d674e46f30078afc97/0_68_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc09fdae5a1230cad71411b0c13ab179", "date": "27/01/2020"}, "rank_258": {"title": "UK alignment on EU standards price to pay for trade deal, say MEPs", "text": "Vote comes as bloc wields its powers to force change in UK domestic law during transition\n\nThis article is more than 1 month old\n\nThis article is more than 1 month old\n\nThe European parliament has called on Michel Barnier to keep Britain permanently tied to its employment, environment and competition laws as the price for maintaining free trade with the EU.\n\nIn a resolution adopted by 543 votes to 39, with 69 abstentions, MEPs said there needed to be \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with EU standards across a range of issues.\n\nAs MEPs gave their seal of approval for the maximalist position, the European commission for the first time wielded its powers under the withdrawal agreement to order the British government to change its domestic law, despite the country having left the EU two weeks ago.\n\nUnder the terms of the transition period, during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union but none of Brussels\u2019s decision-making institutions, EU law continues to be superior to UK national law.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen mocks Boris Johnson's stance on EU trade deal Read more\n\nThe government was given two months by the commission to amend a levy on heavy trucks on which UK-registered drivers can get a discount.

As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially divorced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK\u2019s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Brefusal The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project. Brentry With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.\n\nLisa O'Carroll Referendum The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. 'Give us our money back' Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the \"iron lady\" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand \u201cour own money back\u201d claiming for every \u00a32 contributed we get only \u00a31 back\u201d despite being one of the \u201cthree poorer\u201d members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in \u201cembryo\u201d. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. 'No, no, no' Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was \u2018no, no, no\u2019 to what she saw as Delors\u2019 continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered \u201cUp yours Delors\u201d front page. Black Wednesday A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The single market On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of \u201ca single market without barriers \u2013 visible or invisible \u2013 giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most prosperous people\".

David Cameron returns with reform package. Brexit referendum\n\nBritain leaves the EU\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the London School of Economics on Wednesday, De Rynck said: \u201cIf you allow some irony, some in the UK now seem to want to become Canadians. But of course Dover is much closer to Calais than Ottawa is. The distance from Dover to Calais, and \u2013 thanks to the foresight of Margaret Thatcher and others \u2013 the speed of connection to the tunnel, is of course much quicker than what we have with our Canadian friends. So proximity matters.\u201d\n\nHe said what mattered was the interconnectedness between economies. \u201cZero-quota, zero-tariff access, this brings a lot of benefits to the UK economy and with benefits come obligations,\u201d De Rynck said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s clear that for us it\u2019s a different ball game that we are playing with the UK to the one that we agreed with Canada in terms of the level playing field.\u201d\n\nHe also said a written statement by Boris Johnson on 3 February, in which the prime minister outlined Downing Street\u2019s proposed approach to negotiations, was a \u201csource of some concern\u201d.\n\nOn the same day, Johnson gave a speech in Greenwich in which he claimed the UK would not need to accept EU rules in trade. He outlined the government\u2019s red lines but gave none of the detail that would be expected from parties about to embark on trade talks.\n\nEU member states are due to confirm the bloc\u2019s negotiating objectives at a meeting next week but the UK\u2019s plans to publish a mirror document next week have reportedly been cancelled.\n\nDe Rynck said: \u201cWe\u2019re certainly also looking forward to the UK document that was promised for next week. We, of course, have read the speeches that were given over the last week, also by the prime minister in Greenwich on the 3rd of February and other statements \u2026\n\n\u201cOne written document that came out on the 3rd of February was the ministerial statement, which I cannot hide from you is a source of some concern in terms of the level of ambition of the political declaration not perhaps being fully met always by what is said in that ministerial statement.\n\n\u201cNotably on issues such as level playing field, the court of justice and internal security cooperation, the overarching governance framework which we have agreed with the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s deal with the EU, which took seven years to negotiate, eliminates most import tariffs on goods but not all. It also increases quotas \u2013 the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges \u2013 but does not remove them entirely.\n\nThe UK is in a transition period, after leaving the EU on 31 January, and has until the end of the year to hammer out a trade deal with Brussels. Until then, the country still follows the majority of EU rules.\n\nHighlighting the potential difficulty of negotiating in a tight timeframe, De Rynck said: \u201cWe have a vast amount of work and we seem to have 10 months to do it, or less than 10 months if you calculate the time for ratification so that everybody can be ready on January 1, 2021 for the new regime.\n\n\u201cI would expect some of these negotiations to be rather difficult, perhaps more difficult that during withdrawal because the scope of issues is so much vaster.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3da092884bbdecd2927c5f2c567371020ff218ea/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b1268cedeb98e2f422d0829a004b39cf", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/750bed53ba360fca4a088b5ab129b99c5a963da1/0_215_3290_1974/master/3290.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=70a24cf5eec497f3cfc49f799383faad", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e49b4e8ac17871537ef3dfa97b58cd933ca2429/0_80_4826_2896/master/4826.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e3429d25b2d7fb06bcec0e3dcad5f070", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CTrade+policy%2CForeign+policy%2CMichel+Barnier%2CEurope%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46a0077dc7e64b465cfd2add100045ba29dece40/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=bc064f19401c131bc140ffd86f42a842", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceaf255ad4460ad68cfe8221257c5363150ccdb1/69_178_3342_2006/master/3342.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=334b1af26b9acb0bfdca2b4e71af6ab5", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceaf255ad4460ad68cfe8221257c5363150ccdb1/69_178_3342_2006/master/3342.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0f8ffc000e518adb1f076dbb51bf429f"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceaf255ad4460ad68cfe8221257c5363150ccdb1/69_178_3342_2006/master/3342.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=334b1af26b9acb0bfdca2b4e71af6ab5", "date": "19/02/2020"}, "rank_249": {"title": "Brexit: Emmanuel Macron 'not sure' trade deal possible by end of year", "text": "French president says fishing rights will be key point of contention for negotiations\n\nBrexit: Emmanuel Macron 'not sure' trade deal possible by end of year\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday said he was \u201cnot sure\u201d it would be possible for the European Union and Britain to reach a trade deal by the end of the year.\n\nBritain and the EU are about to embark on negotiations aiming to hammer out a trade agreement by the time the post-Brexit transition period shuts at the end of December.\n\nBut France has made clear it thinks the negotiations will be particularly difficult, especially in such a tight timeframe.\n\n\u201cI am not sure that an agreement will be reached between now and the end of the year,\u201d Macron said at a meeting with fishermen, who are concerned for their livelihoods after Brexit, at an agricultural trade event in Paris.\n\n\u201cAnyway, it is going to become more tense because (the British) are very hard,\u201d he said, adding that fishing rights would be a key point of contention.\n\nBritain formally ended its 47-year membership of the EU on January 31, nearly four years after a majority voted to leave the bloc in a 2016 referendum.\n\nFrance and several other countries want to be able to keep fishing in British waters, while London wants full autonomy and limited access for European fishermen.\n\nTimeline From Brefusal to Brexit: a history of Britain in the EU Show Hide After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially divorced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK\u2019s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Brefusal The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain\u2019s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a \u201cdeep-seated hostility\u201d towards the European project. Brentry With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.\n\nLisa O'Carroll Referendum The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted \"yes\". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. 'Give us our money back' Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the \"iron lady\" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand \u201cour own money back\u201d claiming for every \u00a32 contributed we get only \u00a31 back\u201d despite being one of the \u201cthree poorer\u201d members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in \u201cembryo\u201d. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. 'No, no, no' Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was \u2018no, no, no\u2019 to what she saw as Delors\u2019 continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered \u201cUp yours Delors\u201d front page. Black Wednesday A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The single market On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of \u201ca single market without barriers \u2013 visible or invisible \u2013 giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world\u2019s wealthiest and most prosperous people\". Maastricht treaty Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory. Repairing the relationship Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Ukip Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. \u201cOur interests are best served by not being a member of this club,\u201d he said in his maiden speech. \u201cThe level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.\u201d The euro Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.

David Cameron returns with reform package. Brexit referendum\n\nBritain leaves the EU\n\n\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU\u2019s top priorities are fishing, security and maintaining fair trading conditions for European companies.\n\nHe has also firmly rejected a British suggestion that City of London companies could be given broad, permanent access to EU markets without conditions.\n\nOverall, French fishing boats generate 30% of their revenue from catches in British maritime territories, particularly rich in fish stocks.\n\nFrench officials say that the UK exports the bulk of its catch to Europe, indicating that British fishermen have plenty to lose if the two sides fail to reach a deal.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10555572866c6c3d9d69a15ae437ab292234e130/0_41_3302_1981/master/3302.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac47f41187ff078f53f4dfabf9f6748b", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Brexit%2CEuropean+Union%2CEmmanuel+Macron%2CFishing+industry", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10555572866c6c3d9d69a15ae437ab292234e130/0_41_3302_1981/master/3302.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=262d949b0c998bf2f81a1ead09e74dff", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10555572866c6c3d9d69a15ae437ab292234e130/0_41_3302_1981/master/3302.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac47f41187ff078f53f4dfabf9f6748b", "date": "22/02/2020"}, "rank_217": {"title": "Boris Johnson is the ultimate purveyor of fake news | Roy Greenslade", "text": "Boris Johnson is the first British prime minister with genuine journalistic experience, having been a reporter, columnist and editor. He knows from the inside what the press can achieve. From early in his career, he learned the dark arts.\n\nThere was the infamous fabrication of a quote in 1988 that resulted in his being sacked by the Times. Then, as the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent for five years from 1989, he learned how to spin, making a significant contribution to the creation of Euromyths. The enduring nonsense about straight bananas was one of his recurring themes.\n\nMore important still, he realised that his cavalier coverage of the European Commission had a political consequence. It provided Eurosceptic Tory MPs with ammunition to pursue their war against the EU. As his biographer, Sonia Purnell, rightly put it, Johnson\u2019s writings in those years helped to make Euroscepticism \u201can attractive and emotionally resonant cause for the right\u201d.\n\nIt was especially attractive for Johnson because he had found both a political purpose and a journalistic niche. At the same time, as his public profile grew, he grasped the value of presenting himself as a bumbling comic. It concealed the seriousness of his political agenda.\n\nHis buffoonish image was reinforced in the writing style of his columns in the Telegraph and Spectator. Beneath the florid language, with its artful mixture of self-deprecation, flights of fancy and allusions to the classics, was a rightwing propagandist hiding in plain sight.\n\nHe unashamedly played to the gallery. You want xenophobia, I\u2019ll give it to you in buckets. You want a dose of racism, let me tell you about \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. You want some regional prejudice, how about Liverpool\u2019s \u201cvictim status\u201d?\n\nSexism, tick. Homophobia, tick. Immigration smears, tick, tick, tick.\n\nIn the following years, through his Spectator editorship, his election as an MP and subsequent period as mayor of London, Johnson\u2019s greatest frustration was the loss of his regular newspaper spot. The journalist was pining for his platform. Once it was restored by the Telegraph his work received unprecedented promotion. He had effortlessly achieved a form of journalistic stardom running in parallel with political stardom.\n\nHis one-time boss at the Telegraph, Max Hastings, recognised the peril of handing power to \u201ca brilliant entertainer\u201d, predicting in June last year that a Johnson premiership \u201cwill almost certainly reveal a contempt for rules, precedent, order and stability\u201d.\n\nSo it has come to pass, notably in the way Johnson has treated the media.\n\nAware of the tricks of his old trade, he is doing everything he can to avoid being subject to their wiles. Don\u2019t do as I once did, do as I now say. As the ultimate purveyor of fake news, he was not about to open the door to truth. To that end, he refused to be interviewed by the BBC\u2019s Andrew Neil during the December general election campaign.\n\nThat proved to be something of a dry run for what has happened since. He is sealing himself, and his government, off from journalistic scrutiny. So his ministers are not only banned from appearing on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme but also the softish ITV show, Good Morning Britain. As for Channel 4 News, no chance. Special advisers are also banned from talking to journalists.\n\nMinisters have been ordered not to have lunch with political journalists. In order to ensure they do not fraternise with the \u201cenemy\u201d, No 10 let it be known through a leak to the Sunday Times that Johnson\u2019s eminence grise, his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was establishing a \u201cnetwork of spies\u201d at restaurants around Westminster. Centralised control of \u201cthe message\u201d is essential, as is the control of images.\n\nPhotographers are being excluded from Downing Street events. Johnson prefers key moments, such as the signing of the EU withdrawal agreement, to be pictured by his personal snapper, Andrew Parsons, jokingly known by envious colleagues as \u201cthe court photographer\u201d. Johnson has ignored the inevitable protests.\n\nIt is part of a clear media strategy that manifested itself in the extraordinary treatment of the lobby earlier this month when reporters from a range of publications \u2013 including the Daily Mirror, the Independent, the i newspaper and HuffPost \u2013 were told they could not attend a Downing Street briefing. Hats off to those lobby members who were not excluded for siding with their colleagues and boycotting the meeting. But, given their dependence on those mystical anonymous sources, can they afford to stand firm in future?\n\nNote also that the man responsible for that clumsy attempt to divide the lobby was Johnson\u2019s communications adviser, Lee Cain, another former journalist. His most notable assignment as a Daily Mirror reporter was to dress up as a chicken in order to ridicule Johnson\u2019s predecessor, David Cameron. Not so much a dark art, as an artless gimmick.\n\nJohnson knows exactly what he is about. He is contemptuous of press freedom because he has spent so long making a mockery of it through his distortions of the truth. In that sense, he imagines that all other journalists are no different from him. Give them a chance and they\u2019ll do unto him what he has done to others. He has a particular loathing for broadcast journalists because they can hold him to account in public, hence the snub to Neil.\n\nOne episode illustrates the point. Think back to Johnson\u2019s TV interview in 2013 when Eddie Mair grilled him over his making up of a quote at the Times, his lie to his then party leader, Michael Howard, about an extramarital affair and his questionable assistance to an Eton schoolfriend who he knew was intent on beating up a journalist.\n\nJohnson\u2019s usual defence \u2013 bluster and bombast \u2013 failed. Asked about his prime ministerial ambitions, he replied tamely: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d But Mair wasn\u2019t prepared to let him off the hook, suddenly observing: \u201cYou\u2019re a nasty piece of work, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nAt the time, I thought Mair had overstated his case. Now, after Johnson\u2019s two months at No 10, I salute Mair for his insight. We are witnessing the most troubling assault on press freedom by a modern prime minister. Nasty, indeed.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c9eb67d78206bfc8dd07dd4cfeb0af2d7b502b/52_126_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b176675ac2450d452e3af0ceb5856ed7", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Roy-Greenslade,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=15b48b8e4b6744294489e71d4bfe931f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c9eb67d78206bfc8dd07dd4cfeb0af2d7b502b/37_51_3814_2806/master/3814.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=19d14b2809bba9e9a4dfe4472a41a026", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Boris+Johnson%2CMedia%2CDominic+Cummings%2CThe+Spectator%2CNewspapers+%26+magazines%2CNewspapers%2CThe+Times%2CNational+newspapers%2CDaily+Telegraph%2CDaily+Mirror%2CBBC%2CMagazines%2CPolitics", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53c9eb67d78206bfc8dd07dd4cfeb0af2d7b502b/52_126_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=b176675ac2450d452e3af0ceb5856ed7", "date": "23/02/2020"}, "rank_253": {"title": "Johnson\u2019s Brexit flunkey sums up all that\u2019s wrong with his master\u2019s trade fantasies | Will Hutton", "text": "Last week, an unelected special adviser delivered one of the most political and controversial speeches made by a British public official in recent times. It claimed, in justifying Brexit, that 19th-century political notions \u2013 the nation state with absolute sovereignty and wholesale independence of action \u2013 extended unchanged into the 21st century and were supported wholeheartedly in Britain. This betrayed a combination of ignorance, self-deception and vainglory that will ill serve our country.\n\nDavid Frost, Britain\u2019s lead Brexit trade negotiator, plainly had a rough time in an earlier incarnation in Brussels, drawing the conclusion that the EU is a clunky disaster \u2013 although generalising one\u2019s own personal experience to inform your country\u2019s negotiating stance is rarely a good guide to action. It must be congenial for the prime minister that his lead negotiator plainly thinks that his boss represents the acme of political genius. According to Frost, Boris Johnson\u2019s approach to Brexit combines an ability to read the runes of the British with putting into place the enduring philosophy of the 18th-century, ultra conservative politician Edmund Burke.\n\nIn Frost\u2019s romanticised view of Britain, Leave voters represented a populace unanimously anxious to recover the power of constitutional institutions sanctified by centuries of tradition and now threatened by the dark intentions of continental Europeans. We so love the royal prerogative, the Lords, the first post the past voting system and the monarchical powers of the prime minister that we would rip up our relationships with the EU. He continued: \u201cWe bring to the negotiations not some clever tactical positioning but the fundamentals of what it means to be an independent country. It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us \u2013 to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has.\u201d\n\nUK-EU trade tensions descend into 'slide war' Read more\n\nBut this is bunk, even allowing for the posturing that inevitably frames the beginnings of any such major negotiation. To interpret the Leave vote as vast affection for the feudal trappings of an unwritten constitution to the degree that we want to stand in belligerent opposition to Europe, and make ourselves poorer in the process, is to descend into fantasy. It is a bewildering misreading of contemporary reality.\n\nIt may be true that loyalty to a Burkean vision of the British state existed among conservative Eurosceptic intellectuals. But it hardly describes the motives of the over-50s throughout Britain, in particular in the marginalised English coastal and former industrial communities characterised by declining life expectancy, low wages and low skills, who provided much of the Leave vote. Theirs was a justified cri de coeur about a stagnating present. A generalised nostalgia about the Britain that stood alone in 1940 and went on to create the soothing certainties of the 1950s, coupled with dislike of mass immigration, completed the Brexit mindset. But those under 50, especially in large conurbations dependent on openness and liberal exchange, thought the mindset baleful nonsense. They understand today\u2019s world. Frost speaks at best for part of Britain, a fact a wise public official would acknowledge.\n\nPlay Video 1:38 'There is no need for a free trade agreement': Boris Johnson outlines UK stance after Brexit \u2013 video\n\nNor in 2020 has any state the independence and freedom to make its own laws, especially over trade. He may not have noticed but the exchange of goods and services has always been attended by concerns about standards and quality. The more countries try to gain from trade, the greater the concern to ensure common rules apply.\n\nThis necessarily inhibits the capacity to make independent law; a country may decide it only wants to meet certain environmental standards by 2050, but if it wants to sell its goods in countries that have set a target of 2030 it has to fall into line. A better option is for a group of countries to agree a common date in a trade agreement. An even better option is to establish a treaty framework in which such considerations \u2013 across as many goods and services as possible \u2013 are under constant appraisal to achieve common standards, so maximising trade. You could call such an arrangement the EU\u2019s customs union and single market, if you like, but Burke would have disapproved, so obviously Britain can\u2019t be a member.\n\nBut Burke\u2019s world of independent national sovereignty in which Britain could send a gunboat to force China to import opium and sequester Hong Kong has disappeared. We now have two aircraft carriers, but they are dependent on US planes and in any case could not be deployed independently in war.\n\nEvery major current challenge \u2013 from taxing big tech to protocols for autonomous vehicles \u2013 requires international collaboration, joint action and common regulations. Creating them is painful and involves many compromises, as Britain will learn again at the Cop26 climate change talks it is hosting later this year. Canadians are keenly aware of the difference between their trade agreement with the EU and the one they have been bullied into by the US. They yearn for the kind of power the countries of the EU have developed.\n\nThe task in the decades ahead is to sustain and develop such structures and so allow citizens in every country to be better governed. It may stick in Frost\u2019s 19th-century craw, but the EU, under tremendous strain intensified by Britain\u2019s withdrawal, is precisely such a structure.\n\nThe British political debate is not helped by part of Britain\u2019s left being obsessed by similarly 19th-century constructs \u2013 the notion that it is possible and desirable to use a wholly sovereign nation state to build a socialism whose statist structures require no compromise either internally or internationally. The British left may or may not succeed int devising a philosophy for the 21st century that marries values and policy with the actual interdependencies of our times but for the moment it is irrelevant.\n\nWhat counts is the thinking in the court of King Boris. The musings of one of his most obsequious courtiers last week were not comforting.
