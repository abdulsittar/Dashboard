people amid an ongoing corruption scandal and rising populism that threatens to worsen a lengthy political crisis, a presidential hopeful has said.\n\nMarina Silva, an environmental activist who is currently third favourite to win next year\u2019s election, said the Olympic Games was an example of misplaced priorities in the face of more pressing fundamental needs.\n\nThe event, which came two years after Brazil also hosted the World Cup, failed to deliver on promised improvements, she said, while the country became mired in political scandal.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all the expectation created around what could have left a great legacy for Brazilian society - in terms of urban mobility, transport, environmental values, the greater possibilities for tourism - did not happen,\u201d she told the Telegraph during a recent tour of Europe.\n\n\u201cToday, a good part of the facilities built for the Olympics have been abandoned, causing huge losses.\n\n\u201cBrazil is a country with many problems with health, education, security, sanitation. People certainly would like to see those billions and billions being used to resolve their problems.
