The Olympic Park itself is centered around three original sports venues which were built for the 2007 Pan-American Games. The vision for the future is not just to create a global stage for the Olympic and Paralympic Games of 2016, but also, in the longer term, to create a new legacy district with new homes, jobs and places for leisure activities,\u2019 Aecom said. 'Every Olympics needs to reflect the character and ambitions of the host city and this is where the differences between the two parks are most pronounced. \u2018While London was about demonstrating how a short global event can lead to the long term regeneration of one of the most neglected and deprived areas of the city, Rio is about celebrating Brazil's emergence as a world power as well as making sure there is a strong legacy plan in place.'\n\nGood track record: The London architecture firm which was chosen to design the Rio site, was also responsible for creating the 2012 Olympic park in Stratford", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E452C000005DC-593_964x494.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E53F0000005DC-674_964x687.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/02/article-0-1B95DE97000005DC-879_87x84.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/btn_add-your-comment.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/16/15/26033658-0-image-a-13_1584372452800.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/facebook/DailyMail/DailyMail.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/13/26164522-0-image-m-6_1584623938817.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/08/26156006-0-image-a-6_1584608076876.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/misc/logo_cookie_reg.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E49E4000005DC-864_964x664.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26157278-0-image-m-15_1584610936051.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/04/article-2411371-1B9EBD98000005DC-117_87x84.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/icon_comments_74.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/08/26155204-0-image-a-7_1584605602230.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/02/article-2408773-1B9183DB000005DC-124_87x84.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E5C18000005DC-119_964x494.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E4525000005DC-756_964x494.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/14/26166058-0-image-a-6_1584626400710.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/18/15/26125658-0-image-m-9_1584545633989.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/16/23/26049872-0-image-a-24_1584399745813.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26156864-0-image-a-7_1584610177924.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E52B7000005DC-571_964x687.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E58E9000005DC-249_964x686.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/18/20/26136490-0-image-a-7_1584562324603.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/18/26084914-0-image-m-24_1584469727709.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/19/09/26156778-0-image-m-13_1584610048531.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1BA1D296000005DC-897_636x382.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1B9E58ED000005DC-153_964x686.jpg"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/09/05/article-0-1BA1D296000005DC-897_636x382.jpg", "date": "05/09/2013"}, "rank_17": {"title": "Lawyer Flavia Froese in a fight to rid Rio de Janeiro of its drug lords", "text": "The woman battling Brazil's drug lords: Lawyer braves Rio\u2019s dangerous favelas in a bid to persuade dealers to stop selling crack\n\n\n\nFlavia Froese is a human rights lawyer taking on Rio's drug lords\n\nHopes to persuade them to stop selling crack - even if they sell other drugs\n\nSix million Brazilian adults claim to have tried crack or cocaine\n\n\n\nBrazil has biggest crack problem in the world with $10m worth sold daily\n\n\n\nWith her neat blonde hair and shoulder-grazing earrings, Flavia Froese doesn't look particularly intimidating but to Rio de Janero's crack dealers, that's exactly what she is.\n\nBrazil has the biggest crack problem in the world, with drugs worth 10 million dollars sold every single day and addicts on every corner in the country's slums and shanty towns.\n\nWorse, the crack epidemic has led to spiralling crime rates with murder rates on the increase as drug dons compete for their share of the lucrative trade.\n\nBattle: Lawyer Flavia Froese is fighting to persuade Rio's drug barons to stop selling crack cocaine\n\nDangerous: Flavia is a regular visitor to some of Rio's most dangerous favelas where she meets drug dons\n\nFlavia, however, is one of a growing number of Brazilians with plans to to something about the crack epidemic and says the Government should start taking it more seriously.\n\nCurrently, the Brazilian Government's solution to the crack problem is to 'pacify' the favelas - using the police and army to drive out the dealers and addicts - but so far, only in 30, all in tourist areas, out of 1000, has the policy been implemented.\n\n\n\n'Crack here in Rio is treated like a security risk rather than the public health issue it is,' she explains.\n\n'Without a doubt there is a policy of social cleansing. All they are doing is sweeping dirt under the carpet. The Olympic legacy in Brazil will be an army of zombie crack users.'\n\nMost of Rio's addicts are concentrated in the favelas and in these 'crack lands' can be seen openly smoking the drug on the street.\n\nBut while the dealers are lining their pockets, for those addicted to the drug, the only thing crack produces is misery.\n\nSeedy: Brazilian police have 'pacified' 30 of Rio's 1,000 slums - all 30 are in tourist areas\n\nDisgusting: Ross Kemp in front of one of the many piles of rubbish that Rio's crack addicts live and work in\n\n'I'm here looking for my son, he's a crack user,' says one woman who was filmed entering the favela in her Sunday best for Ross Kemp's Extreme World series.\n\n'I have been struggling with this for five years, all because of this godforsaken crack. Lots of mothers go through this.\n\n\n\n'It hurts when I see them like this sleeping rough, covered in mud, dirty and hungry, I won't give up, he's my son, I can't abandon him.\n\n\n\n'I have roses as a pledge, I put them in church for him, I love my son so much. I have faith in my God, I will see my son transformed.'\n\nAddict: 'Sometimes I don't sleep at all,' says crack user Bobo, who doesn't use his name for safety reasons\n\nPacification: A crack addict, centre, reacts as a social worker tries to calm her during a raid in one favela\n\nFlavia, meanwhile has focused her efforts on persuading the drug barons, many of whom are clients represented by her law firm, to give up selling crack.\n\n'We are here on a mission to give drug dealers a conscience, to get them to stop selling crack,' she tells Kemp as they wander through one of the unpacified favelas.\n\n\n\n'The motivation to change this problem has to come from their own experience because a lot of these drug dealers have relatives who use crack so it's very real for them. They see the destruction that crack causes in the community.\n\n'On the other hand there is of course the issue of profit which is why we haven't yet stopped the sale of crack.'\n\nAnd her fears appear to be borne out. Filmed meeting with one of the drug dons, she is told, in no uncertain terms, that if he doesn't sell crack, someone else will.\n\nNo country for young boys: A young drug dealer sitting on a chair holds a weapon and a two-way radio\n\nNo help: An alleged crack addict, second from right, tries to bite a social worker as she is taken away\n\n\n\n' The problem is that we rely on this,' he adds. 'I earn $10,000 a month but the average salary is $160. There's no comparison.\n\n\n\nHe adds: 'You have to explain that that as long as there's corruption, this won't stop. Corruption in this country is shameless. They hide behind masks, they hide behind everything. We line their pockets and they leave us to sell.'\n\nFlavia herself hopes that the dealers will eventually give up selling crack - even if that means switching to selling other drugs instead.\n\n'I'm not condoning drugs,' she adds. 'I think all drugs are bad.' But with six million Brazilian adults willing to admit they've tried the substance, it's clear that something needs to be done about Brazil's crack epidemic.", "images":

Brazilian people... so can Rio 2016 offer REAL Olympic legacy?", "text": "An old lawyer visited London from Brazil last week. Carlos Nuzman was sorry he had missed Liverpool\u2019s victory over Chelsea and even sadder that he had not been able to witness what was probably the greatest ever Rugby World Cup final. Time is not his friend at the moment. A giant clock in his head is counting down fast.\n\nNuzman is Brazil\u2019s Lord Coe, the president of the Rio de Janeiro Organising Committee for the 2016 Olympic Games. He is the man charged with trying to emulate the success of London 2012 by delivering a Games as spectacular as the host city itself.\n\nThe Rio Olympics are just nine months away and concerns about the readiness of some of its venues are starting to subside. There is more optimism about the progress of the golf course, which was once a great cause for worry. Its main stadiums, the Maracana and the Estadio Olimpico Joao Havelange, have been ready for some time.\n\nCarlos Nuzman is the president of the Rio de Janeiro Organising Committee for the 2016 Olympic Games\n\nFears over the completion of some of the venues in Brazil are starting to subside with nine months to go\n\nNuzman knows, though, that the Rio Games, more than any other for a generation, represent a golden chance to change the lives of a city\u2019s inhabitants through the capture of a sporting event. Nuzman wants a spectacular Games but he knows there is a bigger picture.\n\nIt is easy to become cynical about legacy. It has become a dirty word. Legacy has become the politicians\u2019 excuse for hijacking great sporting events and riding them for all the popularity they can muster. Legacy is about making grandiose promises that are very rarely kept.\n\nThe Athens Games in 2004 were supposed to revitalise the Greek capital but they ended up becoming a monument to waste and abandonment that foreshadowed the devastating financial crisis that has cast the country into economic ruin.\n\nThe Beijing Olympics in 2008 were supposed to herald a new era of respect for human rights in China and hasten the dawn of a raft of freedoms for the people, but none of that materialised. The sporting romantics among us had been kidding ourselves.\n\nThen there was London 2012, which was supposed to initiate a revolution in sporting participation in this country and cut obesity levels in our young. In fact, the figures show that more and more people in England are failing to take part in any activity.\n\nThat is not a reason to damn London 2012. We were treated to a fortnight of magnificent, unforgettable sport and an event so joyous that there were times when it felt like a new beginning for a proudly multi-cultural country.\n\nAthens 2004 was supposed to revitalise the Greek capital but venues ended up becoming derelict and wasted\n\nA locked gate outside the 2004 Olympic beach volleyball venue; it is now disused and a waste of money\n\nLord Coe did a wonderful thing by winning the right to host the Games and then delivering them so beautifully but, in terms of a legacy that could be measured, the benefits were negligible.\n\nIt should be different in Rio. It is not easy to have faith in much to do with sporting administration in these days when new allegations of financial wrongdoing in one governing body or another assail us at every turn. Indeed, a high-ranking official for the company building the Linha 4 metro line crucial to the success of Rio 2016 was arrested as part of a huge corruption scandal that has cast a pall over Brazilian political life.\n\nBut it is still hard not to be optimistic about the force for good the Games can be in Rio.\n\nNuzman, a man with irrepressible enthusiasm, who competed for Brazil in volleyball at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo and became a lawyer and the president of the Brazilian Volleyball Federation, is desperate that the Games should allow many of the inhabitants of the favelas that cling to the hillsides all over Rio to escape to a better life.\n\nThere is significant optimism over Rio 2016, and the belief that the Games are a real chance to change lives\n\nThere is a double decker expressway being built to ease traffic jams, allowing people to move out of favelas\n\nAs he talked intently about what the 2016 Olympics can do for a city where great wealth and great poverty exist side by side amid great beauty, Nuzman, 73, got out a piece of paper and began to draw straight lines on it, stretching from Copacabana and Leblon in Rio\u2019s Zona Sul, out to Barra to the west of the city, where the Olympic Park will be.\n\nOne of the lines represented Linha 4, which is still on target for completion before the start of the Games. Just. Another marked the new double decker expressway that will ease traffic jams. And the last showed the Bus Rapid Transport route that will be another new means of mass transit.\n\n\u2018In 1960,\u2019 Nuzman said, \u2018the capital of Brazil moved from Rio to Brasilia and from that time there was never any change in Rio. That is because of politics. But the Olympic Games will transform the infrastructure of the city. Rio will be transformed more than any other city by the Olympic Games.\n\n\u2018The first legacy for us was achieved when we got the Games to Rio because it is the first time the Games have come to South America. But transport is a critical part of everything. Before the Games, only 16 per cent of the population use public transport. After the Games, we hope 65 per cent will use it.\n\nNuzman speaks of people living in favelas because it is close to work, but hopes to offer them opportunities\n\nNuzman has a tough job emulating the success of Lord Coe (pictured) and the success of London 2012\n\n\u2018Rio has a difficult geography with mountains and rock formations but we are on target to deliver this 10km of Linha 4. It will be very, very important to the population. It will allow people to move out of the favelas and live outside the city.\n\n\u2018This is the most important point. People live in the favelas because it is close to work. Not because they like it. If they can live further away in proper housing and still get to work, it will be cheaper for them and safer and they will have safe transportation.\u2019\n\nThere are other intended legacies. More hotel rooms, more commerce, more jobs. But as sport flounders in its own filth, Rio 2016 and the dreams it harbours for the city\u2019s residents may help to cleanse it.\n\nDOUBLE SACKINGS HIGHLIGHT A SAD FACT\n\nA guess is that Chris Powell lost his job at Huddersfield Town last week because the club had won only once in their last seven games and had slipped to 18th in the Championship. Chris Ramsey lost his job at Loftus Road on the same day because QPR have become a dysfunctional club who forgot they had entrusted Ramsey with a hugely difficult rebuilding job that he needed way more time to complete.\n\nThere is no conspiracy in the fact that two black managers lost their jobs in such a short space of time but their sackings were worthy of note because, sadly, they drew further attention to the fact that there is such a small pool of black coaches working in our leagues.\n\nThe change to recruitment practices, which will begin to implement a form of the Rooney Rule in areas of the Football League from next season, cannot come soon enough.\n\nChris Powell was sacked as Huddersfield boss this week, being replaced by German coach David Wagner\n\nChris Ramsey also lost his job but there is no conspiracy in the fact that two black managers were sacked\n\nWOODS' CADDIE SO DELUDED\n\nWhen Steve Williams complained in his autobiography that Tiger Woods treated him like a slave, it confirmed the long-held impression that the New Zealand caddie has become a legend in his own mind.\n\nWoods did not treat Williams like a slave. He treated him like a caddie. OK, so occasionally Williams had to pick up a club that Woods had tossed on the floor. Big deal.\n\nSo what if Woods wasn\u2019t the best employer? So what if he could be rude or off-hand? He made Williams one of the best-paid \u2018sportsmen\u2019 in New Zealand.\n\nWilliams liked him enough to ask Woods to be best man at his wedding. Williams was always free to leave.\n\nIt\u2019s just that he never did.\n\nCaddie Steve Williams (left) complained in his autobiography that Tiger Woods treated him like a slave", "images":

Rio deliver amid death, corruption and the Zika virus?", "text": "Two people died last week after a coastal path crashed into the sea\n\nThe official countdown to Rio 2016 began last week with the lighting of the Olympic flame in Greece.\n\nYet it was a dark day for the host city after a 50-metre stretch of coastal cycle path crashed into the sea, killing at least two, hours after the torch was lit.\n\nThe cycleway, raised over the coastline of Rio, was one of the Olympic legacy projects to improve links between the beach districts and the west of the city, including the Olympic Park.\n\nBut as Rio approaches its 100-day milestone on Wednesday, the tragedy was the latest event to cast doubts on the city\u2019s preparations for the first Olympics in South America.\n\nWith the Olympics in Rio just over 100 days away, Sportsmail assesses whether the Games will be ready\n\nInfrastructure\n\nWhile almost all of the venues are finished or nearing completion, the velodrome is so far behind schedule that the test event scheduled for next weekend was cancelled.\n\nTrack cyclists will only get the chance to train at the site at the end of June.\n\nMeanwhile, the extension to the metro line, which was seen as essential to ensuring the public could get to the Games, has also fallen behind schedule.\n\nRio state, which was responsible for the work, recently requested an extra R$1 billion (\u00a3195m) from the federal government to finish the line before the Games begin on August 5.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) said the metro line would have a \u2018soft opening\u2019 by the end of June. \u2018Thousands of little details are yet to be managed,\u2019 Nawal el Moutawakel, chairman of the International Olympic Committee\u2019s (IOC) coordination commission, said. \u2018It will make the difference between an average Olympic Games and a great Olympic Games.\u2019\n\nThe Olympic torch was lit in Greece last week as countries across the globe being to gear up for August\n\nCorruption\n\nWhile the race is on to finish the metro extension, there have been allegations of bribes and kickbacks over the contract.\n\nSpiralling costs and alleged evidence by an anti-corruption probe into inflated contracts has led to calls from Rio councillors to open an inquiry.\n\nAnd the collapse of Rio\u2019s new R$44 million (\u00a39m) cycle route, just three months after it was inaugurated, has raised further questions over contracts.\n\n\u2018What happened was absurd,\u2019 said Jefferson Moura, the councillor leading calls for an inquiry. \u2018We have to demand absolute transparency.\u2019\n\nHe said the cycleway had been delayed by six months and felt the pressure to complete the job could have caused the tragedy.\n\nRio\u2019s City Hall has promised an \u2018evaluation\u2019 about the accident and Olympic organisers were prepared to cooperate with any investigation.\n\nThere have been allegations of bribes and kickbacks over commercial contracts and other financial records\n\nTicket sales\n\nDespite the scandals, public approval for the Olympics in Rio is said to be at 70 per cent, according to a survey.\n\nHowever, ticket sales had been slow to pick up with only half sold with five months to go. Organisers said there were high contingency numbers, which have held back the release of tickets, and said sales had picked up since the release of football tickets after last week\u2019s draw.\n\n\u2018For a moment, we began to panic,\u2019 said Mario Andrada, Rio 2016 director of communications. \u2018But we have now sold 78 per cent of those that we offered for sale. We are now on the right track. We know what we need to do.\u2019\n\nZika\n\nOne unwanted guest at the Rio 2016 Olympics will be the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne disease that can affect babies.\n\nThe illness is officially a global health emergency and it has spread to more than 60 countries, with Brazil at its epicentre.\n\nIt raised concerns for the Olympics after health authorities advised pregnant women to avoid affected countries.\n\nHowever, the health ministry said the number of cases of microcephaly, or brain deformity, had started to fall as the dry season approaches and the spread of Zika slowed.\n\nOlympic organisers have given assurances that venues will be inspected daily and measures taken to protect athletes.\n\nPolitical unrest\n\nBrazil president Dilma Rousseff may not make the Games because she is facing impeachment.\n\nThe national congress last week accepted a petition to oust her, and if the senate upholds the decision over a matter that has divided the nation, she will be forced to step aside for 180 days.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/13/22/25953646-0-image-a-19_1584137920572.jpg",

plunges into political turmoil.\n\nProtesters clashed with police in the streets this week after the South American country took the historic vote to oust its current president, Dilma Rousseff, over corruption charges.\n\nWith the world's top athletes, along with thousands of spectators, descending on Rio in less than three months, interim President Michel Temer has been quick to assure his country, and the world, that he intends to pull Brazil 'out of crisis.'\n\n'It's urgent to pacify the nation and unify the country,' he said. 'It's urgent for us to form a government of national salvation, to pull this country out of the serious crisis in which we find ourselves.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nWith the Olympics rapidly approaching, fears are being raised over the future of the Rio Games 2016 as Brazil plunges into political turmoil with protesters clashing with riot police in Sao Paulo (pictured)\n\nProtesters took to the streets this week after the South American country voted to oust its current president, Dilma Rousseff, over corruption charges\n\nThousands responded to the rallying cry of Brazil's 'Iron Lady', congregating on the streets to back her. Anti-Rousseff demonstrators also set fire to banners with pictures of Brazil's acting President Michel Temer\n\nAnti-government demonstrators set up a large inflatable doll in the likeness of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff wearing a presidential sash with the words in Portuguese 'Goodbye dear' and 'Mother of big oil' written on it, in Sao Paulo\n\nOne of his first actions as President was to appoint a new sports minister - the second in two months and the fourth in two years - to try and get the Olympics preparations back on track.\n\nLeonardo Picciani will be the new point of contact for the event's international organizers who have had growing concerns about Rio 2016.\n\n'This will at least give Olympic organizers someone to talk to,' said Sergio Praca, a Brazilian who studies politics at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. 'This lack of command is very bad.'\n\nBut, even if the impeachment battle temporarily tapers off with Rousseff's suspension, Rio still faces myriad problems, making South America's first Olympics the most contentious in decades.\n\nBrazil is mired in the deepest recession since the 1930s, and it's at the epicenter of the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been proven to cause birth defects in newborn babies.\n\nThis week, University of Ottowa Professor Amir Attaran warned that hosting the games in 'the heart of the outbreak' will cause a 'full-blown global health disaster'.\n\nThe public health expert is calling for Olympics to be cancelled, postponed or moved because of the dangers.\n\nUniversity of Ottowa Professor Amir Attaran says hosting the games in 'the heart of the outbreak' will cause a 'full-blown global health disaster'.\n\nAttaran believes if just a handful of visitors to the August event become infected with the Zika virus and travel back to their home countries will result in far more babies being born with brain damage.\n\nThe country is also gripped by a $3 billion corruption scandal at state-run oil giant Petrobras with many of the same construction companies working on Olympic projects.\n\nOther worries include slow ticket sales, $500 million cuts to balance the operating budget, and the death of two men last month when a newly built Olympic-legacy bike lane collapsed into the sea.\n\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff condemned the move to impeach her as a 'coup' and a 'farce', urging her supporters to mobilise after denying she has committed any crimes. She is pictured after the Senate vote\n\nAnd with the Games less than three months away, interim President Michel Temer (right) , who took over form Rousseff (left) has been quick to assure his country, and the world, that he intends to pull Brazil 'out of crisis'\n\n'It's undeniable that Brazil is in a very serious crisis,' former Barcelona soccer great Romario de Souza Faria, now a federal senator, said Wednesday during the impeachment vote. 'No magic tricks will take us from this quagmire immediately.'\n\nAnother major problem is the general apathy towards the Olympic Games in the soccer-mad South American country - which pales in comparison to World Cup.\n\nEven with the Olympics just a few months away, there is little buzz around the competition while there a few adverts or paraphernalia on sale.\n\n'The Olympics have always been a very secondary thing, like something that happened between World Cups,' Praca - the political analyst - said. 'I just don't really see people getting geared up for it like they do the World Cup.'\n\nHowever, the lack of interest towards the game meant that protests over the country's high employment levels and inflation were less likely.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said the IOC looks 'forward to working with the new government to deliver successful games in Rio this summer.'\n\nWhile he admitted that Brazil was currently facing difficulties, he said that a team of IOC inspectors made their final official visit to Rio a month ago, saying things were in place.\n\nThe pro-Rousseff activists clashed with anti-Rousseff demonstrators after the historic vote to impeach the president\n\nRousseff, 68, the country's first female president, condemned the move to suspend her as a 'coup' and a 'farce', urging her supporters to mobilise. Hours later thousands had done so (pictured)\n\nA pro-government demonstrator holds a sign that reads in Portuguese \"Coup\" during a protest against the impeachment of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff in Rio de Janeiro\n\nThe demonstration was ahead of Brazil's historic vote on impeaching President Dilma Rousseff\n\nBut, even if the impeachment battle temporarily tapers off with Rousseff's suspension, Rio still faces myriad problems, making South America's first Olympics the most contentious in decades\n\nBrazil is mired in the deepest recession since the 1930s, and it's at the epicenter of the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been proven to cause birth defects in newborn babies\n\n'Despite the hardships and hard economic conditions, they are on target,' inspection team member Patrick Hickey of Ireland said. 'It's going to be a different games but it will work.'\n\nOrganizers also say that the venues are 99 percent ready which the Olympic torch is winding its way around the country in a three-month relay ending at the opening ceremony.\n\n'The organization of the games is absolutely following the right path,' Carlos Nuzman, head of the organizing committee, said Thursday. 'And it will continue the same way.'\n\nRousseff was ousted Thursday on charges that she manipulated the government's books to make its debts appear more manageable and to help her get re-elected in 2014. She insists the accusations are baseless.\n\nShe was immediately suspended for 180 days pending a trial in the Senate. If she is found by two-thirds of the Senate to have committed crimes, Temer will serve out the remainder of her term, which ends in December 2018.\n\nRousseff maintained the action against her amounts to a 'coup' cooked up by power-hungry opponents with the 'chief conspirator' - Temer, the longtime leader of the centrist Democratic Movement Party.\n\nAnother major problem is the general apathy towards the Olympic Games in the soccer-mad South American country - which pales in comparison to World Cup. Even with the Olympics just a few months away, there is little buzz around the competition while there a few adverts or paraphernalia on sale\n\nThe decision to impeach the president divided opinion, and protesters from both sides of the debate clashed on the streets in the run up to the vote.\n\nAnd her replacement is unlikely to allay fears over disruption as there is a motion being presented to try him for corruption as well.\n\nTemer was appointed acting president despite being barred from running for office after he was fined for violating campaign contribution limits.\n\nHe said another order of business will be putting the economy back on track and grappling with the government budget deficit.\n\n'Our biggest challenge is to staunch the process of freefall of our economy,' he said. 'First of all, we need to balance our public spending. The sooner we are able to balance our books, the sooner we'll be able to restart growth.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/18/26083640-0-image-a-4_1584469724711.jpg",

dire forecasts of corruption, environmental degradation, and cost overruns.\n\nSix months after South America's first games, the flood gates have burst open.\n\nRio organisers still owe creditors about \u00a332million ($40m). Four of the new arenas in the main Olympic Park have failed to find private-sector management, and ownership has passed to the federal government. Another new arena will be run by the cash-strapped city with Brazil stuck in its deepest recession in decades.\n\nThe iconic Maracana has been left unattended since the Rio 2016 Olympics ended in August\n\nThe Rio state government, and Olympic organisers have fought over \u00a3800,000 in unpaid electricity bills for the Stadium\n\nThe rubble from discarded seats were piled up on top of each other after the ground was vandalised\n\nIt was renovated for the 2014 World Cup but has been hit by vandals who ripped out thousands of seats and stole televisions\n\nThe stadium has become the narrative of the aftermath of the Games - with many arenas now dormant\n\nThree Brazilian children walk around the Olympic Park - which Rio organisers still owe creditors about \u00a332million for\n\nThe historic Maracana stadium, site of the opening and closing ceremony, has been vandalised as stadium operators, the Rio state government, and Olympic organisers have fought over \u00a3800,000 in unpaid electricity bills. The electric utility reacted by cutting off all power to the city landmark.\n\nThere are few players for a new \u00a316m Olympic golf course, and little money for upkeep. Deodoro, the second-largest cluster of Olympic venues, is closed and searching for a management company.\n\nThe state of Rio de Janeiro is months late paying teachers, hospital workers, and pensions. The state also reports record-breaking crime in 2016 in almost all categories from homicides to robbery.\n\n'During the Olympics, the city was really trying hard to keep things together,' said Oliver Stuenkel, a Brazilian who teaches international relations at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian university. 'But the minute the Olympics were over, the whole thing disintegrated.'\n\nThe Olympics - and to a lesser extent the 2014 World Cup - showcased the reality of Rio, a city romanticised for its sprawling beaches, annual Carnival celebration, and sensual lifestyle.\n\nIt also exposed the city's crime, environmental contamination, and corruption.\n\nBrazil won gold in the men's football final at Rio 2016, but since then the Maracana has been vandalised\n\nFour of the new arenas in the main Olympic Park have failed to find private-sector management\n\nSome building projects connected to the Olympics and World Cup have been tied to a probe which has led to the jailing of dozens of politicians and businessmen for receiving kickbacks in Brazil's largest corruption scandal.\n\nThree politicians who were instrumental in landing and organising the Olympics - former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, former Rio governor Sergio Cabral, and former Rio Mayor Eduardo - have been under investigation. Cabral, an early promoter of the Olympics and World Cup, has been jailed on corruption charges.\n\n'The Olympics gave people a better sense of the difficulties Brazil faces,' Stuenkel said. 'Maybe not a better or worse image, but more rounded.'\n\nSidney Levy, the chief executive officer of the Rio organising committee, tried to run the games with only private money, and almost succeeded. His \u00a32.4billion operating budget - the budget for running the games, not building the infrastructure - was frugal by Olympic standards. At the last minute, he had to ask for a 250 million real bailout - \u00a364m - from the city of Rio and the federal government to run the Paralympics.\n\nEventually, he got only 100 million reals (\u00a324m), and the shortfall has left organisers owing creditors millions.\n\nThe Olympic Aquatics Centre, where American great Michael Phelps reigned supreme, is a deserted shell of its former self\n\nMeanwhile the outdoor warm-up pool, which was covered during the games, is filled with muddy, stagnant water\n\nToday, Levy says he's nearly a forgotten man.\n\n'I could call the president of the country, and the call was taken,' Levy said. 'But try it today. I could call the IOC and everybody. But now people have other things to handle. We are no longer a priority.'\n\nLevy said organisers probably lost about \u00a3160m in income during the run-up to the games as sponsors backed out of expensive deals as the recession kicked in.\n\nLevy said he has not asked the IOC to help pay debts, but acknowledged the Olympic body came up with millions in advance money several times during the run-up to the games.\n\n'The whole thing was too painful,' Levy said. 'We never really enjoyed the games, themselves; 2016 was just extremely hard. It's like we were climbing Everest, and ice is falling on your lips, and you are not seeing.'\n\nThe Olympic Tennis Centre was used earlier this month for a one-day beach volleyball tournament\n\nDespite the city owning endless sand and beaches the decision was made to use the Olympic Tennis Centre\n\nThe Olympic Park is a ghost town; sleek sports arenas without events, deserted before they were even broken in, and well-tended flower gardens, free from pedestrian wear-and-tear.\n\n'The arenas are beautiful,' Wagner Tolvai said, walking inside the park with his girlfriend Patricia Silva. 'But it's all abandoned, everything has stopped. Nobody is here.'\n\nHe likened the 2.5 billion real (\u00a3640m) park to a new shopping mall 'without stores, or customers.' The park is only open on weekends, and there's not much to do but walk, pedal a bike, or look for shade.\n\nFour permanent arenas are being run by the federal government. Among them is the Olympic tennis centre, which was used earlier this month for a one-day beach volleyball tournament. This in a city with endless sand and beaches.\n\nTwo temporary venues for swimming and handball have yet to be dismantled. The exterior of the swimming venue is falling apart and many translucent tapestries that covered the outside of the building are frayed or falling to the ground.\n\nThis outside shot of the temporary Olympic Aquatics Centre shows it's already crumbling\n\nThe Arena Carioca has mass scaffolding outside it - just months after it was used by basketball star Kevin Durant and Co\n\nThe warm-up pool, which was covered during the games, is filled with muddy, stagnant water.\n\nAway from the park, the famous Maracana stadium has drawn the most attention. It was renovated for the 2014 World Cup at a cost of about \u00a3400m. It was largely abandoned after the Olympics and Paralympics, and then hit by vandals who ripped out thousands of seats and stole televisions.\n\n'The Maracana is the biggest symbol of the way the games were managed,' said Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University. 'The vast majority of people in Rio will never go to the golf course, or the Olympic venues. But the Maracana is different. It's the jewel of the crown.'\n\nUp the road from the Olympic Park, the \u00a3800m Athletes Village - it housed about 10,000 athletes - is fenced off and empty. The developer says it has sold only 260 of the 3,604 apartments - about seven per cent.\n\nRio's Globo newspaper reported that new Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella is arranging low-cost loans for public employees to buy the units.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D07D2C200000578-4210996-image-a-33_1486722077787.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D0ACC8F00000578-0-image-a-25_1486721822549.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/btn_add-your-comment.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D01B00000000578-4210996-image-a-19_1486721485854.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D01B00D00000578-4210996-image-a-13_1486721270283.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/37738DD700000578-4210996-Brazil_won_gold_in_the_men_s_football_final_at_Rio_2016_but_sinc-a-9_1486720857703.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D01B9EE00000578-4210996-image-a-15_1486721278179.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D07D21600000578-4210996-image-a-21_1486721626230.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/09/3D01BD0A00000578-4210996-image-a-5_1486720624829.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/misc/logo_cookie_reg.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/09/3D01B6AB00000578-4210996-image-a-3_1486720505845.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/icon_comments_74.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/08/09/3CF4874F00000578-0-image-m-28_1486546438535.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D07DC0B00000578-4210996-image-a-31_1486721965520.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D01BA0400000578-4210996-image-a-10_1486720903312.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D07CFDD00000578-4210996-image-a-29_1486721918504.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/facebook/DailyMailSport/DailyMailSport.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D01BBA800000578-4210996-image-a-36_1486722198733.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D07DC2A00000578-4210996-image-a-16_1486721479410.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/09/16/3D020BD200000578-0-image-m-15_1486656032783.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/08/22/3CF99DA900000578-0-image-m-7_1486591379085.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/09/3D01AFF000000578-4210996-image-a-2_1486720438611.jpg"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/10/10/3D0ACC8F00000578-0-image-a-25_1486721822549.jpg", "date": "10/02/2017"}, "rank_1": {"title": "Brazil's $12 billion Olympic legacy lies in ruins", "text": "Advertisement\n\nLess than six months ago, the eyes of the world were on the huge Olympic stadiums in Rio.\n\nBillions of dollars were spent on bringing the flagship sporting event to Brazil, with the overall cost estimated to be around $12billion. This was at a time when the Brazilian economy was in a huge recession, and state workers were being paid late, if at all.\n\nBut now the Olympic legacy lies in ruins, new photos have revealed, with arenas crumbling and already falling into disrepair.\n\nThe aquatics stadium, used for last year's Olympic and Paralympic Games, is currently in a state of disrepair. It was set to be dismantled and turned into two schools, but there is no sign of this coming to fruition\n\nThe threadbare pitch of the world-famous Maracana Stadium is a far cry from the days when it hosted the World Cup final and fixtures in last year's Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\nContrast: This was the scene in Brazil's Maracana stadium just months ago as the Olympics got underway with a spectacular fireworks display\n\nIn the aquatics centre, which was built as a temporary structure for the Games, the pool has been drained and the arena look dilapidated on the inside - a far cry from the impressive venue it was last summer.\n\nAnd the world-famous Maracana Stadium, which was also hosted the World Cup final in 2014, is now in a state of abandon, the once-luscious green pitch far from the top playing surface it once was.\n\nThe electricity has been turned off because of unpaid bills - estimated to total nearly $1 million, and like many other arenas used during the Games last year, questions remain over its future. The stadium was looted last month, and the consortium which manages it has called for the state to intervene.\n\nIt is thought hosting the Olympics cost the Brazilian government $3billion, with the rest of the massive bill coming from other sources.\n\nSad legacy: The Olympic Aquatics Centre in Rio de Janeiro, which was set to be converted into two schools\n\nIt remains unclear what will happen to the buildings erected for the Games, with increasing unrest about the amount spent on the Games and the 2014 World Cup\n\nTapestries fixed to the outside of the aquatic centre in Rio, used for the Games, are falling down and the Olympic Park is now a cutting-edge ghost town\n\nIn its heydey, the Aquatics Centre, pictured last year, hosted events featuring some of the world's best known athletes\n\nTwo years earlier, the Ministry of Sport stated, $11.63billion was spent on bringing the World Cup to the cash-strapped country. Such was the outcry that soccer-mad Brazilians took to the streets to protest the massive expenditure at a time when public services were under intense pressure.\n\nThis year, the New York Times reports, that at least 48 towns and cities are considering cancelling carnival celebrations this year because they cannot afford it.\n\nIn Rio, the newspaper states, authorities are predicting a budget shortfall of $1billion this year, with the state budget likely to be $6billion short. It also owes $10billion in loans.\n\nThere were big plans for the Olympic infrastructure once the Games finished.\n\nAbandoned prefabricated houses remain next to the Olympic golf course, created and used for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and now run by the Brazilian Golf Confederation for the public\n\nStunning: In July, aerial pictures showed the lush green fairways of Rio de Janeiro's Olympic golf course\n\nIn August there were scenes of jubilation as Justin Rose of Great Britain, won the gold medal during the final round of the men's golf event\n\nThe taikwondo arena was set to be converted into a school, while the aquarium was due to be dismantled and turned into two schools. None of this has happened, and Brazilians have been left questioning the wisdom of hosting the event.\n\nLast week Vera Hickmann, 42, who visited the Olympic village recently, summed up the disquiet, telling the New York Times: 'The government didn\u2019t have money to throw a party like that, and we\u2019re the ones who have to sacrifice.'\n\nWhile the athletes' village was supposed to be turned into luxury homes, only a small fraction have been sold.\n\nA huge pile of seats, which have been torn up from the stands, inside the Maracana stadium in Rio, which hosted the 2014 World Cup final\n\nRipped seats in the dugouts at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro this month, where the stadium has fallen into disrepair\n\nThe crumbling inside of the Maracana stadium is a shocking indictment of the legacy of the huge sporting events Rio has hosted in the past three years\n\nFlash back: On August 5, the stadium was alive with lights, confetti and fireworks as the Olympic games got underway\n\nUnemployment in the Brazilian capital has doubled since the Games, while GDP has fallen by 8.4 per cent.\n\nPublic employees have had their wages and pensions cut by 30 per cent as the state grapples with the economic crisis.\n\nThe sight of the arenas in disrepair has caused huge discontent in Rio. The tennis centre and velodrome are locked to the public, having failed to find new operators, and the Brazilian capital's $20million golf course has struggled to attract new members.\n\nTheresa Williamson, director of Catalytic Communities, an organisation which supports communities in the city's poverty-stricken favelas, said in an interview with AAP: 'The legacy is incredibly poor.\n\n'This all coincided with the economic recession but in Rio, just like the boom here was more intense because of the Olympics, now the fall is more intense because of the Olympics. Everybody here is suffering right now, of all incomes and all stripes and colours.'\n\nStorage: Pictures show piles of metal and other goods stacked up outside the Arena Carioc in Rio de Janeiro", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/08/3D7099AC00000578-4241412-image-a-8_1487579558505.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/04/3D6FC25200000578-0-image-a-92_1487564051084.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/09/3D70998C00000578-4241412-image-a-17_1487582248025.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/btn_add-your-comment.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/09/3D70991400000578-4241412-image-a-20_1487582284141.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/08/3D70947C00000578-4241412-image-a-2_1487579468912.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/facebook/DailyMail/DailyMail.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/12/3D7238D500000578-0-image-a-43_1487592929809.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/11/3D70991C00000578-4241412-image-a-28_1487590607535.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/17/15/3D56144000000578-0-image-a-79_1487344264543.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/09/3D7099B000000578-4241412-image-a-16_1487582206558.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/misc/logo_cookie_reg.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/12/3D72722500000578-4241412-image-a-50_1487593830542.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/icon_comments_74.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/09/3D7093FA00000578-4241412-image-a-21_1487582302870.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/16/12/3D4ACEF800000578-0-image-a-36_1487249842348.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/12/3D7237E500000578-4241412-image-m-46_1487593361144.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/08/3D7096D700000578-4241412-image-a-4_1487579523497.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/09/3D7094AA00000578-4241412-image-a-14_1487582142365.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/17/02/3D508CDE00000578-0-image-m-22_1487298543067.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/09/3D70961B00000578-4241412-image-a-12_1487582098576.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/12/3D71F71F00000578-4241412-image-a-38_1487592287515.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/12/373AD90600000578-4241412-image-a-11_1487594167164.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/11/0396D4A1000003E8-4241412-image-a-32_1487590818189.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/12/3D72709500000578-4241412-image-a-47_1487593828445.jpg"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/20/12/3D7238D500000578-0-image-a-43_1487592929809.jpg", "date": "20/02/2017"}, "rank_2": {"title": "Millions spent to 'preserve' Rio 2016's legacy", "text": "Advertisement\n\nWhen Poliana Okimoto stepped onto the podium with a 10km open water Olympic bronze medal around her neck she thought her life was about to change forever.\n\nGleefully accepting Brazil's first ever swimming medal, the 34-year-old allowed herself to get caught up in euphoria sweeping the country.\n\nFast forward 12 months, though, and things feel very different.\n\nAfter the athletes left Rio, so too did the optimism as political scandals, including millions of pounds of public money allegedly stolen in bribes for Olympic constructions projects, plunged the country into economic chaos.\n\nRio de Janeiro itself declared itself bankrupt just days after the Olympics closing ceremony, with no more money to pay suppliers to the Games, while hospitals, schools and the police have born the brunt of drastic cuts to public services.\n\nDreams dashed: The legacy of the Rio Olympics has been stained by political scandals, including millions of pounds of public money allegedly stolen in bribes for construction projects, which have plunged the country into economic chaos.

'For a time, we athletes really believed things had changed, that Brazil would never undervalue our sports again.\n\n'After years of hard work, I thought becoming an Olympic medalist would make my life better, easier.

All that we hoped for never happened.'\n\nIf the stars of Rio feel let down, what of people living in the city? They were sold the Games of their dreams. A lasting legacy of better transport, safer streets, new schools, cleaner water and safer streets.\n\nBroken promises: Maicon Andrade (left), 23, claims he didn't receive a promised \u00a33,000 bonus for winning bronze in taekwondo and Diogo Hubner (right), 34, lost Puma as his sponsor despite winning a handball medal\n\nGhost town: A year after its glorious closing ceremony, the only sign The Games were even in Rio are two purpose-built Olympic parks, one of which lies in the wealthy Barra district in southern Rio.

One in the wealthy Barra district in the city's south zone. The other in the poor, Deodoro district where multi-million pound venues, some of which hosted only a handful of events during the Games, lie empty.\n\nOf the original 27 stadiums, a dozen have not been used even once in the last year.\n\nBut the hardest thing for taxpayers to stomach is the cost of running the venues.\n\nThe Velodrome\u00b4s air conditioning \u2013 to preserve the wooden cycling track at a venue used once in the past 12 months \u2013 reportedly costs \u00a3840,000 a year. Earlier this month a fire caused by a flying lantern burned the roof, badly damaging the track.\n\nAccording to the Public Olympic Authority, the cost of keeping the Olympic park running could reach \u00a331million by 2041.\n\nThe city council is believed to spend millions of pounds a month renting 3,604 apartments in the Athletes\u00b4 Village, which still lie empty a year on.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the short-changed people of Rio are today left wondering exactly how the Games improved their lives.\n\nIn December, Rio\u00b4s former governor Sergio Cabral was arrested amid claims he took millions of pounds in bribes from construction firm Odebrect, which built Olympic Park and the Athletes Village.\n\nMeanwhile people feel let down by a string of unkept promises.\n\nThe Deodoro was going to be the city's second largest public park, they said. A radical sports complex \u2013 which held Olympic BMX, mountain bike and slalom canoe events \u2013 would fling open its doors to 1.5 million young people, they promised.\n\nBut today the complex sits closed, its gates padlocked shut with the council claiming they have no money to keep it open. A promised community swimming pool using part of the Olympic slalom canoe course shut in January with no money left to pay for chlorine.\n\nNo entry: This radical sports complex which held Olympic BMX, mountain bike and slalom canoe events was supposed to open its doors to 1.5 million young people but it today sits closed\n\nEmpty: A promised community swimming pool using part of the Olympic slalom canoe course shut in January with no money left to pay for chlorine.\n\nCorrupt: To add to problems, Rio's former governor Sergio Cabral was arrested in December amid claims he took millions of pounds in bribes from construction firm Odebrect, which built Olympic Park and the Athletes Village\n\nOur pictures from a drone above show the park is overgrown and abandoned. The bike trails appear cracked and decrepit, while the pool is stagnant \u2013 a breeding ground for the mosquito which spreads diseases like dengue fever and Zika.\n\nA soldier guarding the hockey stadium entrance says he was under orders to stop anyone taking photos of the site, but claimed the facility 'is hardly ever used'.\n\nNearby, a number of venues built to host other sports such as rugby, basketball and fencing sit empty.\n\nTen miles across the city, at the upmarket \u00a32 billion Barra Olympic park, people take e a very different view of Rio's Olympic legacy.\n\nOpen to the public at weekends, wealthy families are often seen strolling through the park, which hosts table tennis, judo, boasts new five-a-side football pitches, children\u00b4s play areas and skate park.\n\nBut it's the city's poor who feel betrayed. A commitment to clean up the city's picturesque bay to improve water in shanty towns is shown to be another let down.\n\nToday, those living along the bay, host to Olympic sailing say it's more polluted than ever with rubbish strewn across beaches lapped by dirty water.\n\nBruno Ferreira da Silva, 27, who lost his job as a waiter as a result of the economic crisis and now earns 25pence a kilo collects plastic bottles along the beach.\n\nHe says more than 400 bottles a day, adding: 'I make money from the rubbish, but I would prefer a clean beach and water.\n\nDirty: The city's poor feel betrayed after a commitment to clean up the city's picturesque bay to improve water in shanty town was also unfulfilled\n\nDecrepid: Bruno Ferreira da Silva, 27, who lost his job as a waiter as a result of the economic crisis and now earns 25p a kilo collects plastic bottles along the beach, says more than 400 bottles wash up a day\n\nDangerous: 'I make money from the rubbish, but I would prefer a clean beach and water,' Bruno told MailOnline, while a fisherman said officials have done nothing to fix the pollution problem\n\n'I believed the Olympics would improve our city and bring more people and jobs. But the opposite happened, and today everyone has forgotten about Rio.\n\n'The only people who benefited from the Olympics were the politicians who stuffed the money in their own pockets,' he added.\n\nAntonio Maggi, who worked as a fisherman before the bay became polluted, said: 'I believed them when they promised to finally clean up the water.\n\n'But absolutely nothing was done. It was just said to win the Games. They never had any intention of cleaning it up. Now almost everything is worse, health, security, education. There is no Olympic legacy for the people of Rio.'\n\nPerhaps the hardest hit by the Games were the 70,000 people whose homes were bulldozed to make way for venues, roads and car parks \u2013 and have still not received compensation.\n\nThey include mother of two Jacilia dos Santos, 33, who agreed to leave her home near the Olympic Park in 2013 in exchange for a new house.\n\nBroken lives: Perhaps the hardest hit by the Games were the 70,000 people - including Jacilia dos Santos - whose homes were bulldozed to make way for venues, roads and car parks\n\nHeartbreaking: Jacilia dos Santos, 33, who agreed to leave her home near the Olympic Park in 2013 in exchange for a new house, says she received just three months' rent\n\nBut she says she received just three months\u00b4 rent money from the council and still hasn't received the new home she was promised.\n\nShe now rents a cramped single room in a shanty town with her two young children, but is about to be evicted by the landlord after being forced to stop work due to serious health problems.\n\nWiping away tears, she said: 'The Olympics were marvelous, but they have left poor people like me even worse off.\n\n'I believed the hype and their promises that my life would be better. But once they had demolished my house I was forgotten about.\n\n'The Olympics are long gone but I am still suffering because of them. Next week I have to live under a viaduct with my two children. I have no money and I\u00b4ll be kicked out of my home. That\u00b4s what the Olympics did for my family.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434697E700000578-4803642-image-a-14_1503127691714.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434699BB00000578-4803642-image-a-11_1503127691575.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/435CA0DC00000578-4803642-image-a-6_1503127691371.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/18/20/435C7AEF00000578-0-image-a-39_1503082933378.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346969A00000578-4803642-image-a-17_1503127691812.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/btn_add-your-comment.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/facebook/DailyMail/DailyMail.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346987700000578-4803642-image-a-13_1503127691613.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/misc/logo_cookie_reg.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/sitelogos/logo_mol.gif", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/05/16/42FC5E3E00000578-0-image-a-5_1501945914777.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/comments/articles/icon_comments_74.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434697D300000578-4803642-image-a-10_1503127691464.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434697DC00000578-4803642-image-a-3_1503127691106.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/08/13/431207CD00000578-0-image-a-94_1502195924153.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/435CA1AB00000578-4803642-image-a-7_1503127691392.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/435C733A00000578-4803642-image-a-1_1503127691102.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4340B53A00000578-4803642-image-a-4_1503127691255.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434697AD00000578-4803642-image-a-12_1503127691612.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434696FA00000578-4803642-image-a-18_1503127691812.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346999B00000578-4803642-image-a-2_1503127691106.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346981300000578-4803642-image-a-15_1503127691758.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434696BF00000578-4803642-image-a-22_1503127691976.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346992A00000578-4803642-Jacilia_dos_Santos-a-23_1503127692049.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434696CE00000578-4803642-image-a-20_1503127691866.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346988400000578-4803642-image-a-9_1503127691450.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346979300000578-4803642-image-a-16_1503127691763.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434698FB00000578-4803642-Jacilia_dos_Santos-a-21_1503127691938.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/434699EB00000578-4803642-image-a-5_1503127691299.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/08/4346970E00000578-4803642-image-a-19_1503127691832.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/08/16/15/370A0EA100000578-0-image-m-38_1471358184252.jpg"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/18/20/435C7AEF00000578-0-image-a-39_1503082933378.jpg", "date": "19/08/2017"}, "rank_6": {"title": "Brazilian judge orders the closing of Rio de Janeiro's $12billion Olympic Park due to safety issues", "text": "A Brazilian judge has ordered the closing of Rio de Janeiro's Olympic Park in the next 48 hours due to a lack of safety licenses.\n\nThe 17th Federal Court in Rio de Janeiro found that Rio's city government had not provided safety assurances for the $12billion home of the 2016 Olympics that remained opened for public events.\n\nJudge Eugenio Rosa de Ara\u00fajo said in his ruling published late Wednesday that Rio's city hall has not provided safety assurances for the Olympic Park to hold public events.\n\n'This situation, in sites damaged by the lack of surveillance and with thousands of people present, can lead to tragedies,' the judge wrote in his opinion.\n\nA judge from the 17th Federal Court in Rio de Janeiro has given the city of Rio 48 hours to shut down the Olympic Park, home of the 2016 Olympic Games, due to public safety issues\n\nThe Olympic Aquatics Stadium (left and right) was left to deteriorate following the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro\n\nMaracan\u00e3 Stadium grass playing surface was left to rot (pictured left) a year after it hosted the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games (pictured right).

Some the sites the hosted the world's top athletes in the summer of 2016 are closed or underused.\n\nFor instance, a 2017 report found that at the aquatics center, which was built as a temporary structure for the Games, the pool was been drained and the arena look dilapidated on the inside - a far cry from the impressive venue it was.\n\nAnd the world-famous Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, which was also hosted the World Cup final in 2014, was left to fall in a state of abandon. By 2017, its once-luscious green pitch far was far from the top playing surface it once was.\n\nAn aerial view from April 2017 shows the Olympic park which was used for the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games.

Esporte.\n\nIn May 2019, the operating license was once again renewed.\n\nThe Olympic Park, which has nine facilities, has staged music festivals and e-sports tournaments, among other events.\n\nAccording to the judge, who followed suggestions by local prosecutors in his decision, the area is 'progressively battered by the lack of care' and 'ready for tragedies.'\n\nRio de Janeiro's mayor's office said the federal court's decision would be appealed.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/17/18/26083640-0-image-a-4_1584469724711.jpg",
